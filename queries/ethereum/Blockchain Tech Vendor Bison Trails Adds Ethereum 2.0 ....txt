Blockchain technology firm Bison Trails announced its support for features of Eth2 ahead of Ethereum’s planned upgrade.
In an announcement on Monday , the firm said it would support features such as ETH staking and automatically managed validator notes on the upgraded blockchain. A founding member of the Facebook-led Libra Association, Bison Trails provides blockchain infrastructure services to firms.
Ethereum’s transition this fall will move the network from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one in order to improve scaling and reduce power requirements. Bison Trails said helping Eth2 launch was also an opportunity to secure the chain and earn staking rewards.
The firm noted its software would manage client infrastructure automatically, thereby removing the need to manually manage participation when network requirements change.
Bison Trails recently signed a deal with NEAR Protocol, the claimed “Ethereum Killer,” to host its validator set.
