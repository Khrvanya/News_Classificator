In a recent tweet, John Bollinger has hinted that Bitcoin can break the psychological price of $10,000.
The creator of Bolling Bands has postulated a scenario where Bitcoin rallies and breaks $10,000.
CME Bitcoin futures expired earlier today.
Bitcoin is holding steady above the $9,400 and $9,300 support levels.
The creator of the industry-tested charting tool of Bollinger Bands, John Bollinger, has hinted at the possibility of Bitcoin experiencing a nice rally that could see BTC push hard above the psychological price of $10,000. Mr. Bollinger expressed his trading idea via the following Tweet.
If $BTCUSD crams some wax in its ears, and so misses the Siren's song, we could see a nice rally here as the psychological resistance at the round number gets torn out.

What Next for Bitcoin in the Crypto Markets?
Further taking a look at the daily BTC/USDT chart courtesy of Tradingview.com, we observe the following.
The Golden Cross on the daily chart is very much valid and could lead to BTC testing $10,000 once again.
The current price of Bitcoin at $9,400 is above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages further pleading the case of a bullish scenario in the following days.
The short term support zones for Bitcoin are $9,300, $9,200, $9,050, $8,800 and $8,600.
Conversely, the short term resistance zones for Bitcoin are around $9,500 , $9,600, $9,680, $9,773, $9,879, $9,940 and $10,000.
However, there is the possibility of a retracement for Bitcoin as seen through the following chart on the 6-hour timeframe.
From this chart, we observe that the bullish momentum of Bitcoin in recent days might be followed by a retracement. The trade volume is seen to be reducing with the MACD moving averages further indicating a move down into the weekend. Additionally, the MFI is high at 75 further pointing to a scenario where Bitcoin will undergo a cool down before the move Mr. Bollinger has suggested, plays out.
As with all technical analyses of Bitcoin, traders and investors are advised to practice risk management as well as use stop losses to protect trading capital.
