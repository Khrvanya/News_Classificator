Bitcoin rose by 0.57% on Saturday. Reversing a 0.30% decline from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $9,147.7.
It was a mixed start to the day for Bitcoin. Bitcoin rose to an early morning high $9,104 before pulling back.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $9,120.23, Bitcoin slid to a mid-afternoon intraday low $9,060.0.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $9,041.43, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $9,204.0.
Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $9,120.23 and second major resistance level at $9,167.27.
A late pullback saw Bitcoin fall back through the second major resistance level at $9,167.27.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the recent pullback to sub-$9,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend.
Across the rest of the majors, it was a bullish day on Saturday.
Cardano’s ADA led the way, rallying by 3.78%.
Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.07%), Litecoin (+2.43%), Monero’s XMR (+2.52%), and Tezos (+2.38%) also made solid gains.
Binance Coin (+1.90%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+0.14%), EOS (+1.66%), Ethereum (+1.94%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.09%), Stellar’s Lumen (+0.61%), and Tron’s TRX (+1.06%) trailed the front runners.

Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day.
Cardano’s ADA was down by 1.83%, at the time of writing, to lead the way down.
Ethereum (-0.03%), Litecoin (-0.33%), and Monero’s XMR (-0.56%) were also in the red.
It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors. Bitcoin Cash SV and Tron’s TRX were both up by 0.36% to lead the way.
Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall through the $9,137 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $9,214.47.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $9,200 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rebound, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $9,204.0 would likely cap any upside.
In the event of a crypto breakout, Bitcoin should break through the second major resistance level at $9,281.23 before any pullback.
Failure to avoid a fall through the $9,137 pivot level could see Bitcoin struggle on the day.
A fall back through to sub-$9,100 levels would bring the first major support level at $9,070.47 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should avoid sub-$9,000 and the 23.6% FIB of $8,900. The second major support level sits at $8,993.23.
