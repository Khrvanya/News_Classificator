Ethereum is in a daily downtrend and has established a lower high at $232.80.
Bulls still have a chance to create a daily equilibrium pattern by creating a higher low above $216.37.
Ethereum is not doing much after setting a clear daily lower high and losing the 12-EMA at $228.98 and the 26-EMA at $229.64. As long as the bulls can’t climb above both EMAs, the trend will remain the same.
Although buyers were not facing many resistance levels, the selling pressure was enough to make ETH fall below the daily EMAs, losing $230.
The 4-hour chart is surprisingly still in an uptrend because Ethereum didn’t drop below $222.93, the last low. Bulls set a higher low at $223.31 which is a continuation of the uptrend but they are getting rejected from the 12-EMA and the 26-EMA. The next resistance area for buyers is around $230 up to $233.
