Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has recently revealed he isn’t using the Ethereum blockchain to build anything, and addressed his stance on the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Musk’s comments came in response to a tweet published by famous Hollywood actor William Shatner, who claimed last year Elon Musk was, along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, “deciding what to build on Ethereum.”
The Canadian actor, well-known for his role as Captain Kirk on Star Trek, has been a cryptocurrency proponent for some time, at one point even releasing his own non-fungible token (NFT). One year after he tweeted out Musk and Buterin were working on Ethereum, the CEO of Tesla replied.
I’m not building anything on ethereum. Not for or against it, just don’t use it or own any.

In a single tweet, Musk revealed that he is not building anything on top of the second-largest cryptocurrency’s blockchain, nor is he “for or against it.” Shatner later responded to the CEO telling “I still love you even though you haven’t found blockchain technology fascinating.”
Musk has notably made various comments on the cryptocurrency space over time. As CryptoGlobe reported, earlier this year the CEO said crypto could be a replacement for cash . On numerous occasions, he teased the community on the microblogging platform, either tweeting about BTC or about Dogecoin .
In an odd tweet published in January of this year, Musk said “bitcoin is *not* my safe word.” While the tweet itself has never really been explained, over time the COE has said he is “neither here nor there on Bitcoin,” but that he did find the cryptocurrency’s whitepaper “very clever.” In another tweet, he revealed he “only” holds 0.25 BTC .
