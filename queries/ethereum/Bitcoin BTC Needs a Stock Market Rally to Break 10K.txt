Bitcoin has been struggling with the $10K psychological price but its correlation with the stock markets might be the key.
Earlier today, BTC posted a local peak of $9,787.
Bitcoin has been oscillating between $8,900 and $9,800 for over a week.
BTC is still highly correlated to the S&P 500.
Perhaps it is time the correlation worked in favor of Bitcoin to boost it above $10,000.
In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has had an impressive push from around $9,200 to a local peak of $9,787 â€“ Binance rate. However, this move by Bitcoin is still within the range of $9,800 and $8,900 where BTC has been experiencing sideways movement since the 11th of June. Keen traders and investors have their eyes set at $9,800 due to the fact that a clear breakout above this level might just have enough momentum for BTC to attempt and hold $10,000 once again.
Amidst the tense Bitcoin market action, BTCâ€™s correlation with the S&P 500 has not escaped the eyes of analysts in the crypto-verse. In mid-May, and according to the team at Coinmetrics, the correlation was at a value of 0.36 . The same correlation using the same 90 day sampling period, now stands at 0.17.
However, when the sampling period is increased to 360 days, the correlation chart provides a different picture of where Bitcoin is still highly correlated to the S&P 500 as can be seen in the screenshot below.
As the chart above illustrates, the high correlation of Bitcoin with the S&P 500 might not be a bad thing at the moment. With the stock markets experiencing the once doubtful V-shaped recovery, an extension of the stock market rally should have the required effect to nudge BTC above the psychological price of $10,000.
The creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model , @100trillionUSD,  has come up with a formula that predicts a $20,000 Bitcoin in the near future. Key to the formula is the real-time value of the S&P 500. Below is a tweet by @100trillionUSD with the formula using an S&P 500 value of $3,100.

In a follow up to the analysis, @100trillionUSD has further postulated that the last 3 dips by Bitcoin were not caused by Bitcoin whales dumping their BTC in the crypto markets.
So we know #bitcoin and S&P500 are correlated and cointegrated. Chart shows both BTC and S&P. Last 3 dips in BTC and S&P (yellow) were caused by anti-China measures, FED taper tantrum, corona virus. Important lesson from this is IMO: BTC futures or whales did NOT play a big role.

Bitcoin is still highly correlated to the stock markets as seen with the S&P 500. Furthermore, the correlation might not be a bad thing at the moment. It will be essential for Bitcoin to break and hold the psychological price level of $10,000.
Evidence of this correlation being beneficial for Bitcoin has been supplied by Plan B, also known as @100trillionUSD.Â Therefore, for Bitcoin to break and hold $10,000, a stock market rally might be necessary to provide the necessary momentum for BTC.
