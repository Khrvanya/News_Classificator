Bitcoin slipped to its lowest level since June on Wednesday as Mark Zuckerberg began his planned testimonial in front of the House Financial Services Committee. The Facebook CEO will discuss the company's planned cryptocurrency, Libra.
The world's largest cryptocurrency fell as much as 9% to $7,418 in New York.
Lawmakers and critics have expressed concern about Facebook's involvement in the financial system for a number of reasons:
Its sheer size and scale, which lawmakers worry could enable Libra to grow too quickly to properly manage
Zuckerberg is expected to be asked about these items during his testimony.
"The main reason for this is because of the immense pressure Facebook's Libra is getting from Washington," Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak + Co told Bloomberg . "That is basically making it much less likely that Bitcoin will go mainstream as quickly as some of its bulls think it will."
Several early partners for Libra have already dropped out of the project including major players like Visa and Mastercard, and eBay, after major scrutiny of the project from US lawmakers.
