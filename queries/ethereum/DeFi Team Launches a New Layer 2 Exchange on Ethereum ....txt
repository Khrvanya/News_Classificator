The new DeversiFi Exchange offers the security of a decentralized exchange and the speed of a regular centralized exchange.
The DeversiFi Exchange is now live.
It utilizes the ZK-Rollup Layer 2 Scalability Solution on Ethereum.
It can handle 9,000 transactions per second and more.
Traders can trade directly from the ETH Wallets such as MetaMask, Ledger, and Keystone.
Privacy is further guaranteed through the use of StarkWare zkSTARKS technology.
As the Ethereum community eagerly waits for the launch of ETH2.0 in Q3 of 2020, the DeversiFi Exchange has been launched and utilizes the Ethereum’s layer 2 scalability solution known as ZK-Rollup. The team at DeversiFi has been working on the platform for the last year and has done all the necessary stress tests to allow for a full launch earlier today.
The Co-Founder of Ethereum , Joseph Lubin, notified the crypto community of the launch of DeversiFi via the following tweet.
Thousands of TPS are online or coming online at Layer 2 of Ethereum. Scalability has arrived. Congrats to our friends at @StarkWareLtd and @Deversifi . https://t.co/smR2B1sXEc

The DeversiFi exchange allows traders to experience the benefit of Decentralized Finance markets with a fast-moving, off-chain order book. With the order book being on Layer 2 , transactions can be processed quickly and settled on the Ethereum blockchain. The team further explains that DeversiFi is more than just a Decentralized exchange in that traders will enjoy the transaction speeds seen in centralized exchanges.
For the first time, traders can enjoy  all the benefits that they would expect from a legacy large centralised exchange, but with no exchange or counterparty risk.
Traders, therefore, can link the following Ethereum wallets supported by DeversiFi.
The team has promised to add support for additional Ethereum wallets. A screenshot of the DeversiFi homepage can be found below.
Also to note, is that DeversiFi caters for the privacy-conscious traders through its use of StarkWare zkSTARKS technology. The latter is a form of Zero-Knowledge Rollup technology that allows for higher throughput in transactions while at the same time guaranteeing privacy.
StarkWare is the company behind the technology called zkSTARKS or Zero-Knowledge STARKS. The latter is a form of cryptographic proofs that allows for thousands of transactions to be rolled into one batch transaction on the Ethereum blockchain for settlement. This type of scaling is known as ZK-Rollup .
DeversiFi currently has the following Ethereum based trading pairs.
