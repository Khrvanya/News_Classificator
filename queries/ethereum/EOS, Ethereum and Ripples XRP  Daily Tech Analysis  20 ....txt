After an early fall, it’s been a bullish morning for the majors. Failure to move back through early highs will test later, however.
EOS slid by 4.72% on Sunday. Reversing a 4.44% rally from Saturday, EOS ended the week up 4.09% to $2.6045.
A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall from an early morning intraday high $2.7411 to an early afternoon intraday low $2.5366.
Steering clear of the first major resistance level at $2.7999, EOS fell through the first major support level at $2.6459 and second major support level at $2.5542.
Finding late support, EOS broke back through the second major support level to limit the loss on the day.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move back through to $2.70 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.7182.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from the morning high $2.6640.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $2.7411 should limit any upside.
Failure to move back through to $2.70 levels could see EOS give up the early gains.
A fall back through to sub-$2.6275 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.5137 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.60 levels on the day.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from the morning high $186.55.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $189.92 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to move through to $187 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse.
A fall through to sub-$182.30 levels would bring the first major support level at $174.64 into play before any recovery.
