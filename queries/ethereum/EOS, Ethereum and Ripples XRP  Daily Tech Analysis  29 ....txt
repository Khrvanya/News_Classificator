It’s a mixed start to the day for the majors. A move back through early highs would support another crypto breakout…
EOS rose by 1.67% on Thursday. Following on from a 2.49% gain on Wednesday, EOS ended the day at $2.6146.

EOS would need to hold above the first major resistance level at $2.6543 to bring the second major resistance level at $2.6939 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from the morning high $2.6747.
Barring an extended crypto rally, resistance at $2.70 would likely leave EOS short of the second major resistance level.
Failure to hold above the first major resistance level could see EOS hit reverse.
A fall through the morning low $2.6146 to sub-$2.60 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.5476 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.60 levels on the day.

Ethereum would need to avoid sub-$215.20 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $225.91 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from the morning high $224.84.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside on the day.
Failure to avoid sub-$215.20 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse.
A fall through the morning low $220.25 to sub-$215.20 levels would bring the first major support level at $209.73 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $199.03.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break back through to $0.2030 levels
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the first major resistance level and morning high would likely limit any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$0.1990 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red.
A fall through the morning low to sub-$0.1990 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.1968 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer well clear of the second major support level at $0.1928.
