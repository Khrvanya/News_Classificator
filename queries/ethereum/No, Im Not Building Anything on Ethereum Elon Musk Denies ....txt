Thus, the CEO of two of the most popular companies, SpaceX and Tesla, denied any previous assumptions that he’s trying to utilize the Ethereum blockchain for future projects. He also said that he’s not “for or against it.”
Shatner later commented on the lateness of Musk’s response by saying, “that reply only took a year. I still love you even though you haven’t found blockchain technology fascinating!”
The eccentric billionaire, who recently vowed to sell “almost all physical possessions,” has a somewhat intriguing history with the cryptocurrency field, particularly with Bitcoin.
One of the bizarre remarks he made earlier this year was in a tweet, saying that “Bitcoin is not my safe word.” While this statement remains unexplained until this day, the entrepreneur appeared in a podcast shortly after and offered more thorough views on the primary cryptocurrency.
Despite initially claiming that “I’m neither here nor there on Bitcoin,” he noted that when he first read the whitepaper, he thought it was “very clever.” Nevertheless, he didn’t see Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency to serve as replacements for cash anytime soon but acknowledged that they will have a role during this digitalization phase.
Musk also revealed how much BTC he holds only recently when he commented on a post from the Harry Potter author – J.K. Rowling. While explaining that “massive currency issuance by govt central banks is making Bitcoin Internet (ghost) money solid by comparison,” the Tesla CEO said that “I still only own 0.25 bitcoins.”
