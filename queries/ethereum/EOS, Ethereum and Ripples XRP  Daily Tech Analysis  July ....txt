EOS rose by 1.66% on Saturday. Following on from a 2.46% rally on Friday, EOS ended the day at $2.4611.
A bullish start to the day saw EOS rally from an intraday low $2.4210 to an early morning intraday high $2.4980 before pulling back.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to avoid a fall through the $2.4600 pivot level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.4991.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to move back through to Saturday’s high $2.4980.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high would likely cap any upside.
Failure to avoid a fall through the $2.4600 pivot could see EOS struggle on the day.
A fall through to sub-$2.45 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.4221 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.35 levels. The second major support level at $2.3830 should limit any downside.
