Tron (TRX) becomes the 4th digital asset to have its own Twitter emoji.
The Tron community is celebrating this achievement by tweeting about TRX ahead of TRON4.0.
The long wait for an official Twitter emoji for Tron (TRX) is finally over. Earlier today, the project founder, Justin Sun, announced to the community that TRX now has its very own Twitter emoji. Furthermore, Justin Sun requested the Tron community to use the linked hashtags to stand a chance at winning gifts such as a Macbook Pro and an iPhone 11 pro.
Our new #TRON & #TRX are LIVE, try it out & win gifts! 🎉

At the time of writing this, the emoji is linked to the following hashtags:
Back in mid-June, the Tron community had requested Justin Sun to facilitate the process of the digital asset having its very own Twitter emoji. This was after Crypto.com became the second digital asset after Bitcoin (BTC), to have its own emoji on the social media platform. With the launch of the TRX emoji on Twitter, Tron becomes the fourth digital asset to accomplish this feat. Just yesterday, July 2nd, Binance Coin (BNB) became the third digital asset to have a Twitter emoji.
To celebrate the addition of the TRX emoji, the Tron community  was encouraged to use any of the Tron related hashtags henceforth. The Tron Community did not waste time and did just that as can be seen via the following screenshots of their tweets.
Also today, the team at Binance Research released an in-depth analysis of Tron that can be summarized as follows:
Tron has two prominent DEXs: PoloniDEX and TronTrade
Developments continue as illustrated by the road to TRON 4.0, attempting to improve privacy (zk-SNARK), scalability (BFT mechanism), and other interoperability mechanisms.
Recently, some developments included the launch of the Sun Network (a second-layer for dApps), the creation of a MakerDAO-like protocol named JUST, and other developments in the “TRON DeFi space”.
To conclude, TRON might become one of the coins that should stay on everyone’s agenda, as illustrated by other research outlets that also recently pointed out at the on-chain activity size of TRON.
