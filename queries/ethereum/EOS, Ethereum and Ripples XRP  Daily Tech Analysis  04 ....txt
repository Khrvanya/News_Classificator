It’s a bearish start to the day for the majors after Friday’s breakout. A move through Friday’s highs would bring resistance levels back into play, however.
EOS rallied by 7.43% on Friday. Reversing a 5.37% slide from Thursday, EOS ended the day at $2.6508.
A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall to an early morning intraday low $2.4389 before making a move.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.3973, EOS rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $2.6807.
EOS broke through the first major resistance level at $2.5754 before easing back. The second major resistance level at $2.6830 limited the upside on the day.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to Friday’s high $2.6807 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.7414.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break through the morning high $2.6572 levels.
Barring an extended broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside on the day.
Failure to move through to $2.68 levels could see EOS slide deeper into the red. A fall back through to sub-$2.60 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.4996 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer well clear of the second major support level at $2.3483.
Ethereum rallied by 5.80% on Friday. Reversing a 2.56% fall from Thursday, Ethereum ended the day at $134.17.

Ethereum would need to move through to Friday’s high $134.93 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $137.56.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Ethereum to break back through to $135 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, however, resistance at $135 would likely limit any upside on the day.
In the event of an extended rally, Ethereum could eye $140 levels and the second major resistance level at $140.95.
Failure to move through to Friday’s high could see Ethereum slide deeper into the red. A pullback through the morning low $132.59 would bring the first major support level at $128.15 into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from Friday’s high $0.19481.
Barring an extended rally through the day, the first major resistance level and Friday’s high $0.19481 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to move through the morning high $0.19464 could see Ripple’s XRP struggle throughout the day.
A fall to sub-$0.1920 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.18579 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should continue to steer of sub-$0.19 levels.
