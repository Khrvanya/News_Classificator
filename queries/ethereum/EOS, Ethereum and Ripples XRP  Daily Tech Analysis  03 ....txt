It’s a mixed start to the day for the majors. Failure to move through key levels should bring support levels into play.
EOS slid by 5.40% on Tuesday. Reversing most of Monday’s 5.68% rally, EOS ended the day at $2.6762.
It was a bullish start to the day. EOS rallied to late morning high $2.9000 before hitting reverse.
The rally saw EOS break through the first major resistance level at $2.886 before sliding to an early afternoon intraday low $2.5910.
EOS fell through the first major support level at $2.7135 and the second major support level at $2.6030.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.72 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.8538 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break back through to $2.80 levels.
Barring another extended crypto rally, resistance at $2.80 would likely leave EOS short of the first major resistance level.
Failure to move through to $2.72 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall through Tuesday’s low $2.5910 would bring the first major support level at $2.5448 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.50 support levels. The second major support level sits at $2.4134.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $250 levels.
Barring another broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $253.6 should cap any upside.
Failure to move back through to $240 levels could see Ethereum fall deeper into the red.
A fall back through to sub-$230 levels would bring the first major support level at $224.34 into play.
Barring another extended crypto sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear sub-$220 levels on the day.

Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $0.2152 would likely cap any upside on the day.
Failure to move through to $0.2050 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red.
A fall through the morning low $0.20256 to sub-$0.20 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.1952 into play.
