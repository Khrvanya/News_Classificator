EOS, Ethereum and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – June 28th, 2020
It’s another bearish start to the day. Failure for the majors to break through the day’s pivot levels could deliver another sell-off…
EOS slid by 6.01% on Saturday. Following a 0.06% gain on Friday, EOS ended the day at $2.3332.
It was a mixed start to the day. EOS dipped to an early morning low $2.4642 before rising to mid-morning intraday high $2.4839.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $2.5382, EOS slid to a late intraday low $2.1926.
EOS fell through the major support levels before a recovery to $2.33 levels. The recovery saw EOS break back through the third major support level at $2.2057. Resistance at the second major support level at $2.33346 pinned EOS back late on.
At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.25% to $2.3274. A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall from an early morning high $2.3333 to a low $2.3274.
EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through the $2.3366 pivot level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.4805.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break back through to $2.40 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, resistance at $2.40 would likely leave EOS short of the first major resistance level at $2.4805
Failure to move through the $2.3366 pivot could see EOS fall further back.
A fall through sub-$2.25 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.1892 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off, EOS should steer clear of the second major support level at $2.0453.
Ethereum fell by 3.79% on Saturday. Following on from a 1.11% decline on Friday, Ethereum ended the day at $220.76.
Tracking the broader market, Ethereum rose to a mid-morning intraday high $231.1 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $232.69, Ethereum tumbled to a late intraday low $215.16.
The reversal saw Ethereum fall through the day’s major support levels before a partial recovery.
Ethereum broke back through the third major support level at $218.10 to wrap up the day at $220 levels.
At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.39% to $219.91. A bearish start to the day saw Ethereum fall from an early morning high $220.74 to a low $219.65.
Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ethereum would need to move through the $222.50 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $229.52.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from $225 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $231.1 should cap any upside.
Failure to move through the $222.50 pivot could see Ethereum spend yet another day in the red.
A fall back through to sub-$215 levels would bring the first major support level at $213.58 into play.
Barring another extended sell-off, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$210 levels and the second major support level at $206.40.
Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.14% on Saturday. Reversing a 0.63% gain from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.17521.
A relatively bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise to a mid-morning intraday high $0.18356 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.1868, Ripple’s XRP tumbled to a late intraday low $0.16900.
Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.1786 and the second major support level at $0.1745.
Finding late support, Ripple’s XRP broke back through the second major support level to end the day at $0.1750 levels.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.17% to $0.17492. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from an early morning high $0.17517 to a low $0.17447.
Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ripple’s XRP will need to move through the $0.1760 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.1828.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break back through to $0.18 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, resistance at $0.18 would likely leave Ripple’s XRP short of the first major resistance level.
In the event of a breakout, Ripple’s XRP could eye $0.19 levels before any pullback. The second major resistance level at $0.1905 would likely limit the upside, however.
Failure to move through the $0.1760 pivot could see Ripple’s XRP take another hit.
A fall back through to sub-$0.17 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.1683 into play.
Barring another extended crypto sell-off, Ripple’s XRP should avoid the second major support level sits at $0.1614.
