The price of Ethereum (ETH) has shot up in recent weeks. Since January 1, the coin has more than doubled in price, rising from $130 to its current value of $283.
It has made strong gains against Bitcoin (BTC) too. The coin went from 0.018 BTC to 0.027 BTC in the same timeframe, a 50% increase.
Alongside other bullish performances from the rest of the altcoin market, this has helped erode Bitcoin's market dominance—its share of the entire crypto market . Bitcoin's market share has fallen from 68% down to 61% since the start of the year. In contrast, Ethereum's share has bloated from 7.4% to 10%.
As a result, Ethereum looks set to challenge previous highs. Its last peak was at $351 in June 2019, a price value that hadn't been seen since August 2018—on the wane of the crypto bubble. But first it needs to challenge the $300 psychological price point.
Ethereum's not the only top 10 coin in the green today. The price of XRP is up three percent, reaching $0.34. It has similarly seen strong growth in recent months, having risen from a low of $0.18 on December 18.
