Altona differs from testnets like Topaz and Onyx because it is a multi-client testnet. At the same time it differs from the Schlesi testnet (50% Lighthouse client and 50% Prysm client) and Witti because it is the first to be deployed with four clients. However, its most important difference is that Altona is not a simulation of the mainnet specifications, but rather:
(…) a real persistent end-user testnet based on a slightly modified mainnet configuration. Everyone should be able to add validators and beacon chain nodes.
Therefore, Altona’s main objective is to demonstrate that the clients involved are willing to support the mainnet of the Beacon chain. According to Danny Ryan, Altona will initially be a developer-oriented testnet. In other words, it will be a “devnet” that focuses on ensuring that developers are able to test 0.12 software in “a production environment” and that eth2 engineers can work on any bugs that may arise.
In the last months, the expectations for the release of Ethereum 2.0 have been one of the main causes behind the strong performance of Ethereum. At the time of publication the ETH is priced at $227 with a 1.55% gain in the last 24 hours. In the weekly and monthly charts, ETH follows the general market sentiment and presents losses of 6.64% and 6.39% respectively.
