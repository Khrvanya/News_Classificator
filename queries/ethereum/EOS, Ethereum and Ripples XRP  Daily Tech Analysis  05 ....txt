It’s a positive start to the day. The majors will need to move back through Monday’s highs, however, to bring resistance levels into play.
EOS fell by 2.48% on Monday. Following on from a 3.55% slide on Sunday, EOS ended the day at $2.7693.
A bearish start to the day saw EOS slide from an early morning intraday high $2.8466 to a mid-morning intraday low $2.6274.
EOS fell through the first major support level at $2.7326. Finding support at the second major support level at $2.6273, EOS recovered to $2.73 levels before sliding back.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.80 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.8681 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from Monday’s high $2.8466.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $2.8681 would likely leave EOS short of $2.90 levels.
Failure to move through to $2.80 levels would see EOS struggle throughout the day.
A fall through to sub-$2.75 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.6489 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer well clear of sub-$2.60 levels on the day.

Ethereum would need to move through to $210 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $213.49 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from Monday’s high $210.96.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $213.49 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to move through to $210 levels could see Ethereum struggle throughout the day.
A fall back through to sub-$204.30 levels would bring the first major support level at $197.70 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$190 support levels on the day.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from Monday’s high $0.2209.

Failure to move through to $0.22 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall back into the red.
