Ethereum Futures might be the next significant product coming to the cryptocurrency scene, said the CFTC Charmain, Heath Tarbert.
Furthermore, he expressed his hopes once again that the United States can lead the race for both digital assets and blockchain adoption. This aligns with Bakkt plans, as CryptoPotato reported this week.
Bitcoin has dominated the cryptocurrency Futures market, but Ethereum might soon have its own similar product, according to Tarbert. The Chairman of the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) appeared in a recent interview where he offered his views on numerous topics, including the cryptocurrency market.
He talked about the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, saying that both “fall under our jurisdiction.” He continued by outlining his agency’s actions towards the cryptocurrency space and specifically the Futures market:
“We are doing a lot in the digital asset space. We are seeing exchanges started to list; certainly, we have seen Bitcoin Futures, both cash-settled as well as physically-delivered. My guess is we are going to see Ether Futures as well. And as things start to migrate into the commodity space, we will see even more.”
Interestingly enough, Ethereum Futures were recently hinted by the president of the Bitcoin Futures trading platform, Bakkt. As CryptoPotato reported , Adam White supported Tarbert’s views, saying that “the CFTC has only said they’d theoretically have approved futures on mainstream crypto assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum.”
