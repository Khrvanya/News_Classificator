Ethereum Classic price goes ballistic, racks up 30% gains
The price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) has gone up by 30% in the last 24-hours to reach its current value of $9.81. This is a growth spurt of 280% from its low point of $3.50 in December, last year.
However, the price of ETC is still down almost 80% compared to its all-time highest value of $47, reached two years prior.
Ethereum Classic's sudden bullish break appears to be a direct consequence of it being listed on the Binance Futures trading platform. Now, Binance users have the ability to both short and go long on Ethereum Classic with up to 75x leverage—and it seems most traders are long right now.

Owed to its recent bullish activity, Ethereum Classic now occupies the position of the 14th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after achieving a market cap of just over $1.1 billion. As such, Ethereum Classic has climbed 12 places since this time last month—leapfrogging the likes of Chainlink (LINK), Tezos (XTZ) , Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (ADA) to secure its current spot.
