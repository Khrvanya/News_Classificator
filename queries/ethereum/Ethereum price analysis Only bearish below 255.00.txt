The daily time frame is showing that a triangle pattern has formed, hinting that a major breakout is looming for the ETH/USD pair.
If bulls managed to defend the $255.00 level, the ETH/USD pair could push back towards the top of the triangle, which is located around the $285.00 level.
Overall, traders should closely monitor price action for a confirmed breakout from the $255.00 to $285.00 range.

Invalidation of the bullish pattern could cause the ETH/USD pair to capitulate towards the $190.00 level.
Overall, watch out the inverted head and shoulders pattern to shape the fortunes of the ETH/USD pair over recent sessions.
