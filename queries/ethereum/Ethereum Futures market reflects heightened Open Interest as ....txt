13 February saw the market take a nosedive as Bitcoinâ€™s price fell under $10,500 after surging for a few hours. This 3.63% fall within hours, resulted in the fall of altcoins, especially the highly-correlated asset to Bitcoin, Ethereum . Ethereum observed a 5.31% fall within 3 hours, pulling the price of the second-largest crypto-asset to $258.79.
This 3.31% drop was followed by a total liquidation of $5 million. The buy and sell liquidations in a way balanced each other out, going by the data provided by Skew markets. According to the data provider, the sell liquidations amounted to at least $2.2 million and was closely followed by buy liquidations of $2.8 million, at press time.
The sell liquidations could have been the long positions held by the traders to opt-out of the market before incurring major losses. On the other hand, the buying momentum also increased, highlighting the optimism for future profits from traders entering the market at this point in time.
The activity among market traders became evident on 12 February and was visible in the aggregated daily volumes chart presented by Skew.

Similarly, the perpetual swap contracts for ETH Futures were still on the move as the market expected a reversal, an upward trend.

OKEx reported the highest number of open contracts on its platform amounting to $219 million, while the aggregated Open Interest on BitMEX was reported to be $192 million.
