Ethereum (ETH) is once again in the green today, after gaining more than 8% in the last 24 hours to reach its current value of $277. Against Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum is also performing similarly well, and is up more than six percent against the number one cryptocurrency in the last day.
As it stands, Ethereum has pushed through the $270 resistance which it briefly touched several times in the last day, and is now testing $280.
This bullish price action interrupts three straight days of decline for the cryptocurrency, which fell from a peak of more than $286 on Saturday, down to a low of $245 yesterday. Overall, the cryptocurrency is up more than 7% for the week and 50% for the month, making it one of the best performers over all short-term timescales.
It isn't just Ethereum that's back on the up and up; most other altcoins have also returned to life today, with every cryptocurrency in the top 20 by market capitalization now strongly in the green. In total, almost $7 billion was added to the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, bringing the total crypto market cap to over $289 billion.
