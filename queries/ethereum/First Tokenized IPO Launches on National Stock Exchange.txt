Today marks the launch of what is most likely the first ever blockchain-based initial public offering (IPO), with the national stock exchange of the Seychelles selling tokenized shares in its equity to investors worldwide.
At 09:00 U.K. time (08:00 UTC), the shares will be available on the MERJ exchange’s own platform, as well as through broker-dealer Jumpstart and crypto custodian Prime Trust – both based in the U.S. – and U.K.-based blockchain fundraising platform Globacap, MERJ told CoinDesk exclusively.
The IPO sees MERJ issuing 1,652,893 new shares at a price of $2.42 per share, with the aim of raising $4 million to fund its expansion. The sale values the firm at $25 million, the firm said.
The shares are tokenized on the public ethereum blockchain.
Edmond Tuohy, CEO of MERJ Exchange , said:
“These novel financial instruments are here to reshape the financial industry for years to come. MERJ provides the regulatory framework necessary for investors globally to access these markets in a safe and compliant manner.”
Just over a month ago, CoinDesk reported that MERJ had become the first national stock exchange to offer a tokenized security.
While located in the Seychelles, MERJ hosts issuers from North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. It is licensed by the Indian Ocean nation’s Financial Services Authority as a securities exchange, clearing agency and securities depository (CSD).
