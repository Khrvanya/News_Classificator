It’s back into the red for the pack, with more losses on the cards should key levels not be hit by the early afternoon…
Bitcoin Cash ABC slid by 2.22% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.88% gain from Friday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $205.92.
A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rally to an early morning intraday high $212.75 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $213.94, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid to a late intraday low $205.09.
The sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $207.01.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 0.40% to $205.09. Bitcoin Cash ABC eased back from Saturday’s end of the day $205.92.
Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
A move through to $208 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $210.75.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $210 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely pin Bitcoin Cash ABC back on the day.
Failure to move through to $208 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC struggle through the day.
A fall back through to $204 levels would bring the first major support level at $203.09 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$200 levels. The second major support level at $200.26 should limit any downside.
EOS slid by 2.04% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.4% gain from Friday, EOS ended the day at $2.5783.
A bullish start to the day saw EOS rise to an early morning intraday high $2.6389 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $2.6628, EOS slid to a late afternoon intraday low $2.5570.
The reversal saw EOS fall through the first major support level at $2.5908 before finding support.
In spite of a partial recovery late on, however, EOS failed to break back through the first major support level.
At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.43% to $2.5672. A bearish start to the day saw EOS slide from an early morning high $2.5791 to an early morning low $2.5464.
In spite of the early moves, however, EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested.
EOS would need to move through to $2.59 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.6256.
The broader market would need to provide support, however, for EOS to break back through to $2.60 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $2.60 would likely pin EOS back on the day.
Failure to move through to $2.59 levels could see EOS take another slide on the day.
A fall back through the early morning low $2.5464 would bring the first major support level at $2.5437 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer well clear of the second major support level at $2.5094.
Ethereum fell by 2.05% on Saturday. Following a flat Friday, Ethereum ended the day at $141.73.
Tracking the broader market, Ethereum rose to an early morning intraday high $145.03 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $145.63, Ethereum slid to a late afternoon intraday low $141.11.
Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $143.26 and the second major support level at $141.83.
A recovery to $142 levels was brief, with Ethereum falling back through the second major support level in the final hour.
At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.54% to $140.97. A bearish start to the day saw Ethereum slide from an early morning high $141.90 to a low $139.80.
Steering clear of the major resistance levels, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $140.22 before finding support.
Ethereum would need to move through to $142.60 level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $144.14.
Support from the broader market will be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $143 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally on the day, the first major resistance level would likely pin Ethereum back from $145 levels.
Failure to move through to $142.60 levels could see Ethereum take another hit on the day.
A fall back through the first major support level at $140.22 would bring the second major support level at $138.70 into play.
Barring an extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$139 levels on the day.
