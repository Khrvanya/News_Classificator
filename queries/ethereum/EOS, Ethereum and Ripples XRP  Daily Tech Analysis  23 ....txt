It’s a relatively bullish start to the day for the majors. Steering clear of key levels will be needed, however, to bring resistance levels into play.
EOS rallied by 5.24% on Friday. Reversing a 5.18% slide from Thursday, EOS ended the day at $2.5876.
A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall to an early morning intraday low $2.4395 before making a move.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.3710, EOS rallied to a late intraday high $2.6335.
EOS broke through the first major resistance level at $2.5770 to hit $2.63 levels before a late pullback.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.60 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.6676 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from Friday’s high $2.6335.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the major first resistance level would likely limit any upside on the day.
Failure to move back through to $2.60 levels could see EOS slide into the red.
A fall through to sub-$2.5550 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.4736 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of the second major support level at $2.3595.

Ethereum would need to avoid sub-$204 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $212.36 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from the morning high $210.66.
Barring an extended crypto rally, resistance at $215 levels would likely limit any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$204 levels could see Ethereum slide deep into the red.
A fall through to sub-$204 levels would bring the first major support level at $199.20 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $191.08.

A fall through to sub-$0.1990 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.1941 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer well clear of the second major support level at $0.1879.
