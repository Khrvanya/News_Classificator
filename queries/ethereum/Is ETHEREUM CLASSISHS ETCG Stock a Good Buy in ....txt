What do These Ratings Mean?
Finding the best stocks can be tricky. It isn’t easy to compare companies across industries. Even companies that have relatively similar businesses can be tricky to compare sometimes. InvestorsObserver’s tools allow a top-down approach that lets you pick a metric, find the top sector and industry and then find the top stocks in that sector.
These scores are not only easy to understand, but it is easy to compare stocks to each other. You can find the best stock in an industry, or look for the sector that has the highest average score. The overall score is a combination of technical and fundamental factors that serves as a good starting point when analyzing a stock. Traders and investors with different goals may have different goals and will want to consider other factors than just the headline number before making any investment decisions.
