EOS would need to move through to $2.34 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.3938 into play.

Failure to move back through to $2.34 levels could see EOS slide deeper into the red.
A fall back through the morning low $2.3128 would bring the first major support level at $2.2939 back into play.
