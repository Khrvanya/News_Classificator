Stock rose on Thursday and gained for the week, as investors cheered the resiliency of a U.S. economy that created nearly 5 million jobs last month in the throes of the raging coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. economy added a greater than expected number of payrolls in June from May, as regions across the country eased social distancing restrictions and allowed more businesses to reopen. The net additions in payrolls topped consensus expectations, and far exceeded ADP’s private payrolls data on Wednesday, which logged a gain of over 2.3 million jobs .
Although new unemployment insurance claims were higher than expectations, investors shrugged off the report in favor of the boom of workers returning to the labor force. The S&P 500 rose about 0.5% on Thursday to cap off an advance of 4% since market close last Friday. The Dow rose 4.6%, while the Nasdaq rose 3.25% on the week.
Wall Street ended July’s first two trading days in the third quarter on a positive note, buoyed over the past two days both after Pfizer’s ( PFE ) coronavirus vaccine candidate showing progress in a trial phase — and the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep the monetary spigots open “for years.” News Thursday that Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine trial would be delayed past next week did little to knock the risk-on mood across markets.
Still, record-breaking surges in coronavirus infections are overshadowing market psychology, and setting the tone for the start of the second half of a turbulent year.
New York City on Wednesday joined New Jersey in postponing plans to reopen indoor dining , with cases outside the Tri-state area skyrocketing. Meanwhile, a spike in California’s infections reportedly prompted the state to shutter indoor activities, including dining, to mitigate the spread.
And investor expectations are intricately tied to new surges in COVID-19 infections, which are walloping the Sun Belt states and prompting more regions to rethink reopening plans. That may put a definitive cap on a market that’s skyrocketed since plunging to multi-year lows in when lockdowns first began in March.
Markets will be closed Friday in observance of the Fourth of July holiday.

8:31 a.m. ET: New weekly jobless claims come in worse than expected, but extend downward trend since early April

Another month, another record number of jobs created in the midst of the pandemic: June payrolls smash expectations as the economy cranks out 4.8 million jobs, underscoring that May wasn’t a fluke. Stock futures are leaping higher on the number, indicating Wall Street is poised to open sharply higher.
