Indices face a day of drift, as US volumes are out of the picture thanks to the Independence Day bank holiday.

The FTSE 100 has lagged behind, stalled at 6250 for the past week. A break above here opens the way to 6320, and from there on to 6500.
Dips to the zone around 6050-6200 have found buyers, so a break below this is needed to revive the bearish view.
The DAX price has managed to clear 12,600, putting it above the area of resistance around 12,500 that has persisted for the past three weeks.
Further gains target 12,900, while a drop back towards 12,300 may encounter trendline support and establish a higher low.
The breakout from trendline resistance that we saw on Wednesday has continued for the S&P 500 . With the US cash market closed today for a bank holiday, there may not be much movement, but above 3160 the index will push on toward 3240.
The bullish view remains in place unless we see a reversal below 3060, which would bring 3000 into view.
