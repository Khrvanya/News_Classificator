rose 12.7% return month to date, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP,
logged a 15.5% gain in April, with those returns representing the first monthly advances for the equity benchmarks this year.
The monthly rally for the Dow and S&P 500 would mark their best since 1987 and the best April since 1938, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The Nasdaq Composite’s rise would be its best since 2000 and its best April on record, while the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT,
is on track for its sharpest monthly rise since 2011 and its best April since 2009.
On top of that, the major benchmarks are roughly 30% off bear-market lows put in on March 23.
Apparently, stock-market investors are betting that the viral outbreak that has devastated the jobs market, pushing the total number of Americans to around 30 million and likely driving the unemployment rate to the worst levels since the Great Depression, is likely to eventually subside.

That thinking gibes with some other strategists, reports MarketWatch’s William Watts , who notes that Barry Bannister, chief institutional equity strategist at Stifel, who had one of the most bullish calls at 2,950 on the S&P 500, believes that stocks may struggle for further gains after the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies laid the groundwork for the current rally.
The S&P 500 presently stands at 2,905, down 1.2% from Wednesday’s close as stocks face headwinds Thursday afternoon.
