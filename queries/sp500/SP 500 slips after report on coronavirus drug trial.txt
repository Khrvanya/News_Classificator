All three main U.S. stock indexes fell back from gains of over 1% after the Financial Times reported that a Chinese trial showed that Gilead Science's remdesivir did not improve patients' condition or reduce the pathogen's presence in the bloodstream.
The S&P 500 ended marginally lower on Thursday after a report that an experimental antiviral drug for the coronavirus flopped in its first randomized clinical trial, denting optimism that the pandemic's impact on the labor market was nearing an end.
All three main U.S. stock indexes fell back from gains of over 1% after the Financial Times reported that a Chinese trial showed that Gilead Science's remdesivir did not improve patients' condition or reduce the pathogen's presence in the bloodstream.
Gilead said results from the study were inconclusive as it was terminated early.
Last Friday, Wall Street rallied in part because of a report that COVID-19 patients in a separate study had responded positively to remdesivir.
The market's sensitivity to news related to coronavirus therapies reflects investors' desperation for any indication of when the global economy might be able to start returning to normal.
"The hope as of last week was that Gilead could take the fear of dying off the table, which would result in a much quicker, cleaner, faster recovery. If thatâ€™s less likely today than it was yesterday, it is perfectly reasonable for the market to have sold off," said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors.

"The disappointing drug news stings, but considering another 4 million people lost their jobs, the disconnect between how well stocks have held up in the face of historically bad economic data continues," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial.
