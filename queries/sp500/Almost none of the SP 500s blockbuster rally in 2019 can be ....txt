Almost none of the S&P 500’s blockbuster rally in 2019 can be pegged to rising earnings, and that’s a problem, says Goldman
Surging prices, rather than earnings, drove 92% of the S&P 500 returns last year, says Goldman
The stock market’s historic run in 2019 was driven almost entirely by a vigorous rise in price rather than steady earnings growth, according to researchers at Goldman Sachs.
“Valuation expansion drove nearly all of the S&P 500 return in 2019,” wrote Goldman analysts, led by David Kostin. The S&P 500 index SPX,
rose nearly 29% last year, its best performance since 2013.
Since 2009, earnings growth has been the primary driver of equities, accounting for 67% of S&P 500 returns. However, earnings growth explains just 8% of the S&P 500 return last year, Goldman’s researchers wrote.
That rally in stock prices is a phenomenon known among equity analysts as multiple expansion, referring to price-to-earnings, or P/Es — a ratio used as a way of valuing equities, which is derived by dividing the price of the stock by one year of per-share earnings. When shares of a company gain more than their underlying earnings, an asset can sometimes be referred to as richly priced.
Kostin & Co. make the case that multiple expansion has been underpinned largely by low interest rates and stimulus fostered by the Federal Reserve.
However, Goldman analysts warned investors that further market-boosting measures by the central aren’t likely in 2020, after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut interest rates three times in succession last year, leaving key benchmark rates at a 1.50-1.75% range.
“The S&P 500 forward P/E expanded from 14 times to 19 times and accounted for 92% of the index price gain,” Kostin wrote. “Looking into 2020, from a year-end 2019 starting point of 3,231, we expect the S&P 500 index will rise by 5% to 3400 and nearly all of the price gain will come from earnings growth.”
The forward P/E for the S&P 500 has averaged 16.7 during the past five years. That means investors paid more than 16 times for every dollar of company earnings. Over a 10-year period, that multiple stands at 14.9, according to FactSet.
