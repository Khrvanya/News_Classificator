The oversold rally in the stock market that began with a strong upward gap on March 24 continues to forge ahead.
This week, the S&P 500 index  has had some very strong days, supposedly on improvement in the normally bad news about the coronavirus. Last week, the index had some trouble breaking through 2650, but that resistance was overcome this week, and now SPX has well exceeded its declining 20-day moving average. That is the “standard” for an oversold rally.
