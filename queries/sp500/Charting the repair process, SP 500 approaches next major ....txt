Technically speaking, the process of repairing extensive damage to the major U.S. benchmarks remains underway.
Against this backdrop, the bigger-picture technicals have strengthened, amid a persistent April spike, though the rally attempt’s sustainability remains an open question.
hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.
As illustrated, the S&P has maintained its breakout point (2,650), rising to tag next resistance, circa 2,817.
This level matched last week’s high (2,818) and defined the late-2018 range top (2,817).  (See, for instance, the March 5, 2019 review. )
More distant overhead matches the 2,855 area, detailed previously.
Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has DJIA,
The prevailing rally from major support has thus far been capped by the 24,000 mark.
remains incrementally stronger than the other benchmarks.
And here again, the prevailing upturn punctuates a successful test of major support.  Recall that last Tuesday’s session low (7,881) closely matched the breakout point (7,880), an area detailed previously.
More immediately, significant resistance is currently under siege.  The specific areas are better illustrated below.
Widening the view to six months adds perspective.
On this wider view, the Nasdaq has extended to a significant technical test.  Five overhead inflection points stand out:
Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq has ventured atop each area early Tuesday.
Nearly immediate follow-through atop the major moving averages would lend weight to the view that the rally attempt is viable, not merely a corrective bounce.  This area “should” draw selling pressure amid an intact bear market.
Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also registered a sharp April rally attempt.
In its case, three familiar inflection points remain in play:
The Dow’s 200-week moving average, currently 23,719.
Last week’s close (23,719) effectively matched the 200-week moving average, though an extended retest remains underway.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has knifed from major support broadly spanning from 2,447 to 2,478.
The rally attempt initially stalled at its next notable resistance (2,817).  Recall that last week’s high (2,818) matched the inflection point.
Collectively, the process of repairing extensive technical damage remains underway.
The bigger-picture backdrop has strengthened amid a persistent April rally, though the rally attempt’s sustainability, and the potential incremental upside from current levels, remain open questions.
Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF remains the weakest widely-tracked U.S. benchmark.
Still, the small-cap benchmark has sustained last week’s strong-volume breakout.
On further strength, an inflection point matches the 2018 low (125.81).  (Each big three U.S. benchmark is positioned atop the 2018 low.)
Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF has sustained an April breakout, of sorts.  Here again, the follow-through has been punctuated by increased volume.
Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 has sustained a break atop the 20-day moving average, rising from three-year lows.
The upturn has thus far stalled slightly under its breakdown point, an area spanning from about 284.80 to 285.50.
Returning to market breadth, the prevailing rally attempt has strengthened internally, as detailed last week.
Recall that 2020’s second-strongest session internally registered just last week.  That day, NYSE advancing volume surpassed declining volume by a 12-to-1 margin.
As detailed repeatedly, in a textbook world, two 9-to-1 up days, across about a seven-session window, reliably signals a major trend shift.  (Recall that the early-2019 rally originated from two 9-to-1 up days across a precisely seven-session window.)
Against the current backdrop, the prevailing rally attempt has encompassed a 15-to-1 up day, an 8-to-1 up day, and a 12-to-1 up day across a 12-session span.
Collectively, the recent breadth stats are stacking up more favorably — as more legitimately bullish, rather than merely reflexive — even beyond the headline numbers detailed above.
Widening to the four-year view, the S&P 500 has registered a massive reversal on the weekly chart.
Consider that last week’s close registered 598 points, or 27.3%, above the March low (2,191.8).
Conversely, last week’s close registered 603.7 points, or 17.8%, under the S&P’s record peak (3,393.5), established Feb. 19.
The S&P is vying Tuesday to register its first close formally atop the 50% retracement.
Returning to the six-month view, the S&P 500 has registered bullish April price action.
Recall that the April rally originates from a bullish island reversal near major support (2,478).  Moreover, the reversal encompassed an 8-to-1 up day, and 12-to-1 up day, across a three-session span last week.
Amid normal conditions, the price action would likely be sufficient to signal a major trend shift.  Still, current conditions are not normal, presenting a question mark.
Last week’s close (2,790) roughly matched the 50% retracement.  The S&P is vying Tuesday to register its first close officially atop the inflection point.
Separately, additional resistance (2,817) matches the late-2018 range top, a level preceding the massive late-2018 market plunge.  This area remained within view even late last year.  (See, for instance, the Dec. 10, 2019 review. )
Last week’s high (2,818) closely matched next resistance.
Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 2,891, is dropping at about an 8-point clip per day, and is setting up to reach the 2,855 area in the next four or five sessions.  This area is shaping up as a potentially major bull-bear inflection point.
Conversely, significant support closely matches the April breakout point, circa 2,650. The bear-market rally attempt is comfortably intact barring a violation.  Delving deeper, familiar last-ditch support broadly spans from 2,447 to 2,478, the area that launched the prevailing rally attempt.
Beyond the prevailing recovery attempt, the S&P 500’s intermediate- to longer-term bias remains bearish. To reiterate, the 2,855 area marks a notable inflection point, and the eventual retest may be consequential.

Drilling down further, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF GLD,
continues to act well technically.
As illustrated, the shares have cleared the range top, reaching seven-year highs amid increased volume.
Tactically, initial support broadly spans from about 157.20 to 159.40, the latter matching the breakout point.
Delving deeper, the former range top (149.00) is followed by gap support (147.85).  A sustained posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias.
Meanwhile, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF is also showing signs of life.
Late last week, the group reclaimed its breakdown point (26.00), also knifing atop the 50- and 200-day moving averages.  The subsequent strong-volume follow-through places it above the former range top (30.00).
Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the group’s recovery attempt is comfortably intact barring a violation of the 200-day moving average, currently 27.50.
Looking elsewhere, the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ,
— most recently profiled last week — tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index.
As illustrated, the shares have extended a rally from 52-week lows, rising to reclaim the 200-day moving average, currently 200.08.  As always, the 200-day is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator.
On further strength, an inflection point matches the 50-day moving average, currently 205.25, a level that underpinned the prior uptrend.  The QQQ has ventured atop the 50-day early Tuesday.
Conversely, a notable floor matches the former range top (194.50).  The prevailing recovery attempt is intact barring a violation.
is a Dow 30 component exhibiting relative strength.  (Yield = 2.3%.)
Technically, the shares have recently knifed atop the 200- and 50-day moving averages.
The subsequent flag-like pattern — a tight four-session range — signals muted selling pressure, positioning the shares to build on the initial April spike.
Tactically, the former breakdown point (56.10) closely matches the April gap.  Intel’s recovery attempt is firmly-intact barring a violation.
is a well positioned large-cap name.
As illustrated, the shares have knifed to a 52-week high, edging atop resistance on increased volume.
More broadly, the shares are well positioned on the three-year chart, rising from a massive double bottom defined by the 2019 and 2020 lows.
Tactically, trendline support closely tracks the 50-day moving average, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.  Note that the company’s quarterly results are due out April 20.
