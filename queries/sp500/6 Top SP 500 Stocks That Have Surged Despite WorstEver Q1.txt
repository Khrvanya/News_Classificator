Wall Street just completed one of the worst quarters in its history. First-quarter 2020 will live in infamy as the quarter that every market participant wants to forget. In contrast, the prior-year quarter witnessed the best performance in three decades.
However, it is to be noted that this disappointing performance is not due to any economic, financial or geopolitical factors but instead a health hazard — the coronavirus pandemic — decimated an otherwise booming U.S. stock market.
The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — plunged 23.2%, 20% and 14.2%, respectively, in first-quarter 2020. This was the worst ever first quarter performance of both the Dow and the S&P 500.
Notably, the blue-chip index registered its worst ever quarterly performance since fourth-quarter 1987. For the  benchmark index, last quarter was the worst performing one since fourth-quarter 2008. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq recorded biggest quarterly losses since the fourth quarter of 2018.
Moreover, in March alone, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 13.7%, 12.5% and 10.1%, respectively. All three major indexes posted worst monthly performance since 2008.  Further, for the first time in more than decade, the broad-market S&P 500 index entered the negative territory in each of the first three months of a calendar year.
Some of the stocks, however, have remained immune to the market bloodbath. A closer look at the benchmark index paints a different picture. A portfolio of 30 stocks has in fact rallied in the first quarter defying the panoptic impact of coronavirus on the economy and financial markets.
Nevertheless, market is likely to remain extremely choppy in the next few weeks. This can be inferred from two things. First, President Donald Trump urged U.S. citizens to prepare to face a “very, very painful two weeks.” White House officials are projecting more than 100,000 deaths owing to coronavirus infection. Second, the COBE VIX — the best fear-gauge of Wall Street — is currently at 53.54, significantly above its historic average range of 20 to 25.
However, there is some good news as well. Per the Conference Board, the U.S. consumer confidence in March came in at 120. The data was lower than the February's revised reading of 132.6 but exceeded the consensus estimate of 115. Moreover, a measure of business conditions in the Chicago region declined to 47.8 in March from 49.0 in the prior month. However, the data was better than the consensus estimate of 40.
Additionally, the U.S. government and the Fed has already decided to provide fiscal and monetary stimulus worth $6 - $7 trillion. Besides the United States, internationally another $5 trillion of stimulus is anticipated to be generated in the next few weeks. All these positives will encourage long term investors to buy good stocks at attractive valuation at this stage.
