Wall Street logged its best day in over a month on Monday as news from a Moderna trial stoked optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 911.95 points higher, or 3.9%, at 24,597.37. The S&P 500 gained 3.2% to close at 2,953.91 while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.4% to 9,234.83. The Dow and S&P 500 both had their biggest one-day gains since April 6 while the Nasdaq posted its best rally since April 29. The S&P 500 also closed at its highest level since March 6.
Moderna shares rallied 20% after the company reported "positive" phase one results for a potential coronavirus vaccine . The company said that after two doses all 45 trial participants had developed coronavirus antibodies.
"This information coming out of Moderna takes a little bit of the unknown out of the market," said Christian Fromhertz, CEO of The Tribeca Trade Group. "So there's a knee-jerk reaction that's going on with all those names that have been under pressure." Fromhertz referred to those stocks as "have-nots."
"I think that's just how it's going to work," said Fromhertz. "The closer they get to reopening the country, the more this is going to be beneficial for the 'have-nots' and there's going to be more profit taking in some of the 'haves.'"
Disney closed 7.15% higher while MGM Resorts rallied 10.5%. Cruise operator Carnival gained 15.2%. Delta and United Airlines both rose more than 13%. Netflix — a stock that has benefited from people staying at home — closed 0.3% lower.
Bank stocks rose broadly. Wells Fargo jumped more than 8% while Bank of America and Citigroup both closed over 6% higher. JPMorgan Chase advanced 5.3%.
