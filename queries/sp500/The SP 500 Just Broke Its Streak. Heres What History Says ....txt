The S&P 500 fell 1.6% on Monday.
It did, in the end , happen: After 70 relatively calm trading days, the S&P 500 finally closed with a move bigger than 1% on Monday.

The S&P 500 index closed down 1.6% on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also lost 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.9% as investors became increasingly worried about the spread of the coronavirus . The Chinese government has put several cities on lockdown to try to contain the virus, which has infected thousands and killed at least 80 people. In recent days, the disease has been found in patients in the U.S., France, and Australia.
We looked back at the previous 12 times that there were streaks of at least 70 days that the S&P 500 closed with no move of 1% or greater and at the S&P 500’s returns for the year after the streak was broken. According to Dow Jones market data, the index rose 7 out of 12 times on a price-return basis in the year that followed and 9 times out of 12 on a total-return basis. On average, the S&P 500 gained just over 6% on a price basis in the year after a streak of 70 days or more without a move of 1% or greater, and added 9.6% on a total return basis.
