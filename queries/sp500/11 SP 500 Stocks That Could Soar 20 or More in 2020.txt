Never say never, but it's hard to see stocks follow their amazing 2019 returns for a second straight year.
S&P 500 stocks sent the index a whopping 29% higher in 2020. That's a big deal. Keep in mind that the market's long-term average annual gain comes to about 7.7%, then factor in the tendency for share performance to revert to the mean, and the odds of another boffo year are slim.
Indeed, years in which the S&P 500 rises at least 20% generate an average gain of only 6.6% the following year, according to Bespoke Investment Group.
But that doesn't mean investors can't try to replicate 2019's party by seeding their holdings with stocks expected to blow away the broader market. To find stocks primed to outperform, we scoured the S&P 500 for stocks with expected price gains of at least 20% this year. We supplemented that research by limiting ourselves to stocks that are Buy-rated or better by Wall Street analysts, as well as boast promising fundamentals, attractive valuations and other bullish features.
Here, then, are 11 of the best S&P 500 stocks you can buy for outsize gains in 2020. Based analysts’ projected price returns, Wall Street expects these names to rally from 20% to more than 35% this year.
