In this week’s webinar on IG Client Sentiment (IGCS), I discussed the outlook for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and DAX 30. For a more detailed overview including fundamental analysis, check out the recording in the video above.
The IGCS gauge implies that 31.94% of retail traders are net long the S&P 500. The number of those exposed to the downside have climbed by 4.15% and 8.69% over the past 24 hours and week respectively. From here, the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger bullish contrarian trading bias. From a psychological standpoint, that may speak to a rising share of traders attempting to pick the next top.
On the daily chart below, S&P 500 futures are struggling to close above a key range of resistance between 3118 – 31156. Prices seem to be supported by the 20-day simple moving average which could precede a push higher. In such an event, keep an eye on RSI. A swift climb towards next resistance (3213 – 3231) could open the door to negative divergence, a sign of fading upside momentum.
The IG Client Sentiment (IGCS) implies that 45.91% of retail investors are net long the Dow Jones. The number of traders net short are 3.08% down from yesterday. However, over the course of one week, those exposed to the downside have increased by 7.08%. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed trading bias.
What are some unique aspects of trading currencies?
Dow Jones futures are trading right on the 20-day simple moving average after temporarily falling under it. Prices may struggle to push further as resistance holds between 26193 – 26658. A turn lower from here places the focus on support 25230 followed by the 24507 – 24792 inflection range. Keep a close eye on RSI in the event prices push towards the June 9 high, divergence could emerge and show fading momentum.
