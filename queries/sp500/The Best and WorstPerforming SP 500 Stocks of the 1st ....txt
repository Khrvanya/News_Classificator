Some of the companies within the S&P 500 Index, however, had better luck. According to the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , a feature for Premium users, stocks that beat the benchmark index by the widest margin during the quarter included drugmakers like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) and Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), which is unsurprising as many health care-related stocks got a boost due to working on developing a cure or test kits for the Covid-19 virus.
As it is a key player in making coronavirus test kits and is developing a potential treatment, Regeneron was the top performer for the quarter, beating the S&P 500 by 56.37% and returning 32.27% year to date. With a $54.16 billion market cap, the company's shares were trading around $495.98 on Thursday morning.
Software companies like Citrix Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) and NortonLifeLock Inc. (NASDAQ:NLOK) also posted strong returns for the quarter, along with real estate investment trust Digital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE:DLR) and consumer goods manufacturer Clorox Co. (NYSE:CLX).
On the opposite end of the spectrum were oil companies like Apache Corp. (NYSE:APA), Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE:MRO) and Noble Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:NBL), which took a hit from the oil price war that broke out last month after Saudi Arabia announced its plans to boost production. All three stocks have tumbled more than 75% since the start of the year.
Cruise line stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH), Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) and Carnival Corp. (CCL) were also beaten down as the coronavirus outbreak caused entire ships to be put on lockdown and quarantined. As a result, all three stocks plummeted more than 80%.
As the uncertainty continues, investors may want to look further into these companies as they could be good value opportunities going forward.
