If there’s a stock I wished I’d bought after the recession, Pool would have to be at the top of the list. From the market bottom on March 9, 2009, POOL stock is up 1,517%, considerably better than the 249% return for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ).
Interestingly, I recommended that InvestorPlace readers sell POOL in May 2018, because I felt the valuation at 38 times cash flow was exceptionally rich. Today, despite moving 29% higher in the two years since, it trades at a more reasonable multiple of 27 times cash flow .
“POOL is one of those stocks I wish I’d owned long-term because it’s been one of the most consistent performers on NASDAQ,” I wrote on May 15, 2018. “
“If you look at its annual returns, you’d swear you were looking at a fast-growing tech stock, not the world’s leading distributor of swimming pool products.”
Year to date it’s down a reasonable 7.5% compared to 18.4% for the markets as a whole.
The beauty of its business: People will always spend the money to keep their pools looking clean in good times and bad. As a result, POOL has increased its revenues and operating income every year for the past decade.
