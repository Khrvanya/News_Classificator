BNN Bloomberg's closing bell update: June 8, 2020
North American equity markets rallied into the closing bells, with the S&P/TSX Composite up 0.76 per cent, the S&P 500 rising 1.20 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1.70 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.13 per cent to extend last week's gains.
With the rally, the S&P 500 is now in positive territory year-to-date, joining the Nasdaq in erasing its 2020 losses. The TSX remains about 6.4 per cent away from break-even territory in spite of a 42 per cent rally from the March 23 low.
In Toronto, nine of the 11 TSX subgroups closed the day in positive territory, lead by an eight per cent jump in the cannabis-heavy health care group, a nearly four per cent rise in real estate stocks and a 1.2 per cent gain in energy. Consumer staples and industrials were the only sectors to close lower.
Oil slid, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate down 3.64 per cent to US$38.11 per barrel. Alberta's Western Canadian Select was down 4.32 per cent to US$29.24 per barrel.
The Canadian dollar gained a quarter of a cent against its U.S. counterpart to 74.26 cents U.S.
12:45 p.m. ET: North American equity markets hang onto gains, oil slides
North American equity markets hung on to their gains through the midday trade, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index up two-tenths of a per cent, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index both 0.35 per cent higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperforming with a 0.8 per cent gain. The S&P 500 remains within three-quarters of a per cent from breaking even on the year after a massive rally from the March 23 lows.
In Toronto, the breadth of the rise was limited, with only five of the 11 TSX subgroups in positive territory, led by health care, real estate and energy. Consumer staples, industrials and the information technology sector were the largest percentage decliners.
The health care group was driven higher by a rally in cannabis stocks, with HEXO Corp. up more than 30 per cent, Cronos Group Inc. up 15 per cent and Aphria Inc. up 11 per cent.
Overall, 161 of the TSX Composite’s 229 constituents were in positive territory.
Crude oil extended declines, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate falling 3.2 per cent to US$38.27 per barrel to trade near session lows. Alberta’s Western Canadian Select fell 4.09 per cent to US$29.31 per barrel.
The Canadian dollar remained higher against its U.S. counterpart to trade at 74.63 cents U.S.
North American equity markets kicked off the week in positive territory, extending last week’s gains following ongoing optimism of gradual global economic reopening as coronavirus cases trend downward.
The S&P/TSX Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained about 0.6 per cent, the S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 per cent.
Markets have enjoyed a strong rally from lows last seen on March 23, with the TSX up about 42 per cent, the Nasdaq positive on a year-to-date basis and the S&P 500 less than a per cent from breakeven on the year. Not a single TSX-listed company is in negative territory since that March low.
Oil prices gave up some earlier gains with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate down 1.4 per cent to trade at US$39 per barrel. Crude initially rose after the OPEC+ group agreed to extend its record-breaking production cuts for another month, but slipped into negative territory after Saudi Arabia said it wouldn’t extend additional cuts past June.
The Canadian dollar made modest gains against its American counterpart, rising a tenth of a cent to 74.64 cents U.S., though the U.S. dollar was weaker against all of its major peers.
