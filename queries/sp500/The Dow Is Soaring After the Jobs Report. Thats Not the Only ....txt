The Dow Jones Industrial Average is soaring after a stronger-than-expected U.S. payrolls report . But that’s not the only reason its rising.
Dow futures have gained 389 points, or 1.5%, while S&P 500 futures have risen 1.1%, and Nasdaq Composite futures have advanced 0.9%.
The U.S. added 4.8 million jobs in June, topping forecasts for 3.1 million. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 11.1% from 13.3% and topped the consensus for 12.5%.
“Very good number,” writes Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere. “[Better] than expected and a lower [unemployment rate] despite the increase in participation (participation up more than expected).”
The government looks to have worked out the kinks in the unemployment number, with misclassifications adding just 1 percentage point to the number in June. “The takeaway being that even adding 1 pp to the UNR gets us better-than-consensus print,” writes BMO’s Ian Lyngen.
Stocks were rising long before the jobs number came out, however. That’s likely because the market is hoping a stimulus bill will be passed before benefits expire at the end of July. Overnight, the House passed a $1.5 trillion stimulus bill , while the PPP plan was extended into August. President Donald Trump said that he’d like to see more payments for Americans , and even mentioned the House plan in recent comments.
Of course, the good number means that Congress may not want to agree on a stimulus package for the economy . But we’ll worry about that later.
