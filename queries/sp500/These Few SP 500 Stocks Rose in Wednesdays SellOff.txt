Out of all stocks on the S&P 500 Wednesday, no stock rose more than 2.3%.
The S&P 500 fell as much as 3% Wednesday, as virus cases seem to be continuing their substantial second wave of spreading. For the entire month of June, the index is flat, a move which included an almost 6% down day a few weeks ago. The move that day was predicated on a spike in virus cases, before stocks began rebounding as the largely cautious market observed that lockdowns had not yet been reinstated in most states. Meanwhile, it has been technology and secular growth stocks supporting the market, rather than cyclical value.
The 5-day moving average of daily new coronavirus cases in the U.S. hit 34,000 Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins data. That level was last seen in late April. Just about a month ago, the trend was at 17,000. News also broke that visitors to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut from “hotspot” states like Florida and Texas are mandated to quarantine for 14 days, stoking fears of more lockdowns.
Wednesday, airlines and casino’s sold off more than 5%, while biotech stocks that are in the process of seeking COVID vaccine approvals, rallied. Some have suggested $3 billion (a drop in the bucket compared to the U.S. economy) worth of tariffs on European goods imposed by the U.S. is contributing to the sell-off, but the market movements suggest Wednesday was all about the virus.
