S&P 500 Records Historically High 50-Day Rally: 5 Top Picks
The dream run of Wall Street's new bull market seems unstoppable at the moment. Notably, the new bull run began in mid-April after all three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — broke out from the coronavirus-induced short bear market.
Meanwhile, the broad-market S&P 500 Index achieved a milestone registering the highest ever 50-day rally since the inception of this index in 1957.
On Jun 3, the S&P 500 gained 1.4% to close at 3,112.87, its highest finish since Mar 4. The benchmark index rallied 37.7% over the last 50 trading days. Per LPL Financial, this marked the highest 50-day return of the index since 1957.
Notably, Jun 3 marked the first four-day winning streak of the S&P 500 since early February. The index is currently 8.7% below its all-time high of 3,393.52 recorded on Feb 19. The index has rallied an astonishing 41.7% till Jun 3 from its recently recorded lowest level of 2,191.86 on Mar 23. Additionally, the benchmark needs to gain 3.34% more to become positive year to date.
The S&P 500's closing level at Jun 3 was well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 2,819.18 and 3,005.31, respectively. In financial literature, the 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as the short-term support level, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter.
According to LPL Financial, historically the S&P 500 index provided 100% positive returns after six months and 12 months for all other largest 50-day rallies. The average 6-month and 1-year returns were 10.2% and 17.3%, respectively. Going by the history, the benchmark index will continue its momentum over the next one year.
Meanwhile, the market's worst is behind us. An unprecedented $8 trillion stimulus injected by the U.S. government and the Fed will create significant pent-up demand. The central bank's unlimited asset purchase program and maintaining a 0% interest rate policy have created a strong credit market to sustain business recovery.
Moreover, slowing down of the coronavirus outbreak and death count, and gradual reopening of the U.S. economy after nearly two months of lockdown, will encourage business activities and hike consumer spending. This will drive the U.S. GDP in the second half of this year. A series of better-than-expected economic data, released recently, clearly showed that the U.S. economy is bottoming out.
