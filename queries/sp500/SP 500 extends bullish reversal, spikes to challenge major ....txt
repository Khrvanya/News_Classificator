U.S. stocks are firmly higher early Monday, rising after positive early results for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine, and well received Federal Reserve remarks regarding the economy.
Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has knifed to its third recent test of major resistance (2,954) an area that has thus far capped the recovery attempt.  Mondayâ€™s early session high (2,957) has registered nominally atop resistance, and a potentially consequential retest remains underway.
