This weekly cycle points up.
On January 9th, I pointed to cresting weekly and monthly cycles as reasons for a lower S&P 500. The actual high was on February 19th, and the index has dropped more than 20%. I once asked the late Art Merrill which factor was more important in determining the end of a market move…time or price. He responded by stating that price would be the primary factor. In that case, the 1987 crash could have been considered a mini bear market. Because the Fed can simply inject funds into the system without limit, corrective periods can be shorter and bear episodes can end more quickly. Sentiment has reversed from overly optimistic to very bearish in a short period of time. It appears that Thursday’s drop has put in a tradable low.
The first two charts show the weekly and the monthly S&P cycles making lows. The next significant high is likely due in mid-April.
The last posting on bonds pointed to a weak month for fixed-income instruments. The extraordinary stock market decline pushed bonds up counter to expectations. With the equity market recovering and bond cycles still declining, bonds will likely be much lower by the end of March. In addition, notes are headed for a period of great seasonal weakness. From March 17th through 27th, notes have fallen almost 90% of the time since 1982.
This reliable cycle pinpointed the top and is now making a low.
The monthly cycle is also making a low.
