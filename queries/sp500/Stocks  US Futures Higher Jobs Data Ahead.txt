The three cash indexes are on course to post another positive week, following on from their best quarter in decades, amid signs that the vast monetary and fiscal stimulus from the U.S. authorities has resulted in a prompt economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak's ravages.
The U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded more than expected in June, housing data have shown a strong bounce and retail sales posted a record jump in May, adding to hopes that the recovery will be faster than predicted.
