The two stocks that contributed the most to 2019’s total stock-market returns also hold that position for the entire decade.
While it’s fun to look at how the overall composition of the top 10 contributors has changed—with a noticeable shift from the energy sector to finance, for example—it’s perhaps more interesting to note the enduring heft of Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) for investors, as this chart shows .
The two companies didn’t just dominate. They actually intensified their hold over the past decade, moving from a share of 8.45% of the total S&P 500 return over the decade to 14.8% over the last 12 months through Dec. 27, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
As Barron’s noted, the two tech giants are the only companies with valuations of more than $1 trillion.
Rounding out the top 10 contributors to returns since 2009: Home Depot (HD), Pfizer (PFE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Chevron (CVX), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B). For the past year, that includes Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Bank of America (BAC), AT&T (T), and Alphabet (GOOG).
And Apple and Microsoft weren’t the only stocks intensifying their hold over the market. The top 10 contributors made up about 19.6% of the total stock market return over the decade, but 29.5% over the past year.
