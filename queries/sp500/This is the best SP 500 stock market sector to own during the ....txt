The utilities sector of the S&P 500 has had the second-best performance behind tech during summers since 2010.
Utility stocks have posted big numbers during June, July and August months since 2010, and the most consistent gains of any S&P 500 sector, according to data from Kensho, a hedge fund trading data platform. In nine of the past 10 years, the utilities sector has posted a positive return during the summer, the best percentage of any sector. Its average return, of 3.27%, is also second among all sectors, barely trailing tech's average return of 3.28%, which is tradable in the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF.
Utility stocks did see large gains in the extended bull market that came before the coronavirus crash, and there were concerns the sector was overvalued as the stock market hit record highs. In fact, since U.S. economic growth peaked in the second quarter of 2018, utilities had been the best-performing sector of the market.
If utilities spike during the summer, it would not be the first big run for the sector this year, as it started 2020 very strong, gaining 6.61% in January, when it far surpassed the S&P 500 as well as the tech sector's return.
Low interest rates, low energy prices and tax cuts have allowed utilities to invest in upgrades without raising customer bills, while the low-interest rate environment has favored the defensive dividend sector as an alternative to fixed-income.
One popular ETF strategy that aims to limit equity market risk, the Invesco S&P Low Volatility ETF , recently rotated out of some big utility stocks and increased its exposure to growthier tech stocks. Its portfolio is reallocated based on the stocks with the lowest volatility over the preceding 12 months.
