LONDON, UK - It was a quiet day on world markets on Friday with U.S. markets closed ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend.
Trading was cautious due to the continued uncertainty of the direction of the coronavirus which appears to be surging still in many parts of the world. The total number of cases registered globally climbed above 11 million on Friday.
"I think infection rates and fears of localised lockdowns have doused some of the enthusiasm," Societe Generale strategist Kit Jukes told Reuters Thomson on Friday.
"We have three elements now; vaccine hopes, decent data in most places - but also the return of infection rates, which can make you nervous."
In London on Friday, the FTSE 100 ended the day 1.33% lower.
The German Dax slid 0.64%, while, in Paris, France the CAC 40 shed 0.84%.
