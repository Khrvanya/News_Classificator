With two decisive negative candles in the past two days, and the potential for a third today, there has been a complete dismantling of the bullish breakout. A decisive close underneath the 108.10 old breakout support now means that the market is in reverse once more. Pressure is mounting on 107.05 initial support, but if this breaches it would open 106.00 once more. This is a remarkable turnaround in sentiment, with momentum indicators increasingly corrective now. A confirmed sell signal on Stochastics, whilst RSI moving so quickly back below 50 (from above 70) and a threat of a MACD bear cross is also a near term bearish signal. The old 108.10 level will be seen as a basis of resistance once more, whilst the hourly chart shows consistent lower highs and lower lows of recent days where old support is new resistance (initially then 107.85 is a barrier today).
