Money managers are scaling back wagers on gold, the Japanese yen and other popular havens, betting that the outlook for the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit will continue to improve.
Gold prices are down nearly 4% after hitting a six-year high in September. The yen has given back around half of the gains it made against the dollar since a rise in trade tensions earlier this year sparked a rush for safe assets. Other havens, including the U.S. dollar, Treasurys and the Swiss franc, have also softened in recent weeks.
