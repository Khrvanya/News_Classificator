Asian stocks looked set to rebound as the risk-off mood sparked by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East ebbed. U.S. shares closed higher while Treasuries and the dollar dropped.
Futures gained in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Australian shares opened higher. U.S. equity futures were flat. Earlier, the S&P 500 Index rose for the third time in four sessions, erasing early losses, as heavyweight technology companies led a recovery. Gold retreated from the highest in more than six years and the yen held losses. Ten-year Treasury yields rose to above 1.80%. Crude oil fell to trade below $63 a barrel, after reaching the highest since April.
Investors turned their focus to improving trade relations with China planning to sign the first phase of its trade deal with the U.S. in Washington on Jan. 15, according to people familiar with the matter. Still, though the sudden escalation of tensions in the Middle East last week lost momentum, sentiment remains cautious.
“It’s wait-and-see mode here," said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager with Federated Investors. “How much, if at all, do things escalate with Iran and does it ultimately impact the global economic outlook? Right now, not so much. Could it change? Sure."
Here are some events to watch for this week:
Federal Reserve officials Richard Clarida, John Williams, James Bullard and Charles Evans speak on Thursday.
The U.S. monthly employment report is due Friday.
