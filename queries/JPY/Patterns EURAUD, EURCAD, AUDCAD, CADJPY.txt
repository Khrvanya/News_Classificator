The single European currency has been trading sideways against the Australian Dollar since June 15. The currency pair was trading between the 1.6422/1.6226 area during the past two weeks.
Everything being equal, the exchange rate could continue to trade sideways within this week's trading sessions. The EUR/AUD pair could target the 1.6226 area in the shorter term.
However, technical indicators suggest that the currency exchange rate could edge higher during the following trading sessions.
The common European currency has surged by 177 pips or 1.17% against the Canadian Dollar since June 19. The currency pair breached the 50-, 100– and 200– hour SMAs during this period.
As for the near future, the exchange rate could continue to edge higher within this week's trading sessions. The potential target for the EUR/CAD pair would be at the 1.5481.
However, the weekly R1 at 1.5415 could provide resistance for the currency exchange rate during the following trading sessions.
The AUD/CAD currency pair has been consolidating between the Fibo 50.00% at 0.9290 and the 0.9420 level since the beginning of June.
Given that the exchange rate is supported by the 55– and 100-hour moving averages near 0.9385, it is likely that some upside potential could prevail in the market. In this case the rate could target the 1.0200 level in the medium term.
Meanwhile, note that the currency pair would have to exceed the monthly R3 at 0.9453. If the given level holds, it is likely that a reversal south could occur, and the pair could decline below the 0.9250 mark.
The CAD/JPY exchange rate has been declining within a falling wedge pattern since the middle of June.
From a theoretical point of view, it is likely that a breakout north could occur within the following trading sessions. In this case the currency pair could re-test the psychological level at 82.00.
Meanwhile, note that the exchange rate is pressured by the 55-, 100– and 200-hour moving averages. Thus, a breakout south could occur in the nearest future, and the rate could re-test the 75.00 level.
