TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo stocks ended sharply lower Thursday after the Federal Reserve's signal to maintain near zero interest rates until the end of 2022 lifted the yen against the U.S. dollar, with investors continuing to lock in gains amid caution about the market overheating.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended down 652.04 points, or 2.82 percent, from Wednesday at 22,472.91, posting the biggest daily point fall at closing since April 1 when the key index tumbled over 850 points, following media reports that the number of coronavirus infections in the United States has surpassed 2 million.
The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 35.79 points, or 2.2 percent, lower at 1,588.92.
Decliners included marine transportation, air transportation and insurance issues.
In currency trading, the U.S. dollar remained weak around the 107 yen line. At 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 106.93-95 yen compared with 107.08-18 yen in New York and 107.33-35 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Wednesday.
The euro was quoted at $1.1362-1364 and 121.50-54 yen against $1.1368-1378 and 121.83-93 yen in New York and $1.1359-1361 and 121.92-96 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday afternoon.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond dropped 0.015 percentage point from Wednesday's close to 0.005 percent as investors bought the debt amid a sharp fall in Tokyo stocks.
The Fed on Wednesday kept its key interest rate near zero to support the U.S. economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic, while unveiling projections that show the economy shrinking 6.5 percent this year.
The U.S. central bank's sluggish economic outlook spooked investors and its plan to keep rates near zero for the next few years dragged down U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar against the yen, hitting financial issues and exporters, brokers said.
But the U.S. central bank's stance of maintaining an easing stance will be a plus for equity markets in the long term, they said.
"Market players reacted to lower yields and shifted their money to safe-haven assets, which led to selling in the stock market," said Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
Shares losses continued in the afternoon, in tandem with drops in U.S. stock futures and other Asian stock markets after the report regarding the U.S. virus infections.
"Investors took the report as an excuse to cash in as Tokyo shares remained overvalued," said Shingo Ide, chief equity strategist at the NLI Research Institute.
On the First Section, declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,939 to 203, while 27 ended unchanged.
Among Financial issues, Daiwa Securities Group was down 15.40 yen, or 3.2 percent, at 465.30 yen, while nonlife insurer Sompo Holdings dropped 151 yen, or 3.9 percent, to 3,725 yen.
As for exporters such as automakers, Honda Motor sank 172.00 yen, or 5.7 percent, to 2,867.00 yen and Nissan Motor plunged 40.90 yen, or 8.8 percent, to 423.00 yen.
Trading volume on the main section rose to 1,679.56 million shares from Wednesday's 1,257.74 million shares.
