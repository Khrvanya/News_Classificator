The Reserve Bank of Australia on Friday released its statement on monetary policy, where it highlighted that global GDP is "expected to fall sharply in the first half of 2020."
"The declines in the March quarter were driven by a contraction in Chinese and euro area activity as well as the rollout of containment measures elsewhere late in the quarter," the report said. "A further fall in global GDP is expected in the June quarter, with many countries expected to record quarterly declines in GDP."
"We shouldn't expect to see a V-shaped recovery," Sat Duhra, portfolio manager of Asia dividend income strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Friday. "We've seen a bit of a V-shaped recovery in markets but that's not how the real economy will behave."
"When we think about the U.S. and we're talking about you know … one month worth of jobs data erasing nearly a decade worth of jobs gains and that's pretty incredible stuff," Duhra said. "You cannot expect those people just to walk back into a job when shops and businesses start to open in the next few months."
