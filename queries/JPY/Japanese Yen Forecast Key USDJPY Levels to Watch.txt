The Japanese Yen is softer to begin the week as risk sentiment remains robust having recovered from last weekâ€™s dip. That said, recent price action in USD/JPY signals a lack of conviction among traders with the pair somewhat rangebound. Given that the macro risks persist amid the potential threat of a second wave of coronavirus cases, alongside rising US/China tensions, the looks to be on the downside.
On the technical front, key support at 106.70 (50% Fibonacci retracement) has stemmed further downside for now. On the topside, option strikes ($2.2bln) at 107.50 may contain spot prices, while notable resistance is situated at 107.75-108.00. However, failure to upside USD/JPY at 108.00 may alleviate downside risks in the pair.
