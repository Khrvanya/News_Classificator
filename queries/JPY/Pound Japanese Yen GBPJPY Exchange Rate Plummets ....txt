The Pound Japanese Yen (GBP/JPY) exchange rate plummeted by -2% today as the Japanese currency makes gains on its safe-haven appeal. The pairing is currently trading around ¥129.800.
The BoJ said in its statement:
The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained from its safe-haven status after the US Federal Reserve slashed its interest rates on fears that the Covid-19 outbreak would weaken the world’s largest economy.
Tom Learmouth, an economist for Japan at Capital Economics, commented:
The Pound (GBP) fell against JPY after the UK Government was heavily criticised for its approach to the nation’s coronavirus epidemic. GBP investors are wary of the currency as the virus is expected to escalate in the UK.
A number of senior doctors and scientists wrote to Downing Street:

The GBP/JPY exchange rate failed to benefit from today’s Rightmove House Price Index for March. The gauge showed an increase from 0.8% to 1%.
Andrew Burrell, a researcher at Capital Economics, was downbeat:
‘The market will probably grind to a halt, as people won’t be wanting to go out for viewings or have strangers in their home, but because there will be both fewer sellers and fewer buyers, I don’t see any big changes in prices.’
Japanese Yen (JPY) investors will be awaiting Tuesday’s release of January’s Japanese industrial production report. We could see the JPY exchange rate begin to dip if the figure confirms consensus and falls by -2.5%.
Sterling traders will be eyeing tomorrows’ release of January’s ILO unemployment rate. Any signs of improvement could boost the Pound.
The GBP/JPY exchange rate will continue to be driven by developments around the coronavirus. Any further signs of an escalation of the virus in the UK would prove Pound-negative.
