"I think markets are looking at the playbook of SARS and what we found there was, it was a big hit ... to growth in the countries that were most affected but it was a V-shaped recovery," Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Friday. A V-shaped recovery describes  downturns that see a steep fall before recovering sharply.
