GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY, EUR/JPY, Japanese Yen Technical Analysis – Talking Points:
** JPY index averages USD/JPY , AUD /JPY, EUR /JPY and GBP /JPY
Waning market sentiment was a primary driver of the haven-associated Japanese Yen’s surge in June, climbing back from post-crisis lows to test the downtrend that has encapsulated price action since the highs of March.
Both the RSI and Momentum indicators seem to suggest a more sustained pull-back as price rests precariously atop its 200-day moving average.
Sellers may be encouraged by the steep decline of the 50-DMA which could see price penetrate support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement.
A break below may open up a path for further JPY losses against its major counterparts and could be indicative of strengthening market optimism.
A resurgence of risk appetite cushioned AUD/JPY’s collapse through Rising Wedge support in mid-June, as the sentiment-driven exchange rate remains constructive above the 200-day moving average (72.30).
AUD/JPY’s outlook seems skewed to the upside as both the RSI and Momentum indicators strengthen in step with recent price action.
However, resistance at the June 16 high (75.09) may prove a significant hurdle for AUD bulls.
