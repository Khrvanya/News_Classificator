The “pro-risk” New Zealand Dollar has been succumbing to selling pressure as of late, particularly against the “anti-risk” Japanese Yen. Fears around the deadly coronavirus emanating from central China have caught investors off guard in thinner trading conditions . Stocks saw a synchronized decline across the world in Asia, Europe and North America . NZD/JPY thus had its worst day (-1.31%) since early August on Monday.
In the immediate sense, a sudden disruption in the world’s second-largest economy as the government restricts regional travel poses as a risk for future revenues. That the Wuhan Virus is also occurring during the Lunar New Year exacerbates this concern. Softer-than-expected Chinese manufacturing PMI could further dent market sentiment on Friday as the data will be reported during the outbreak’s growing momentum.
Down the road, fears around the coronavirus could be contained as governments step up efforts to prevent further outbreaks and a greater insight about mortality rates are known. The risk for sentiment is that a deepening selloff in equities triggers other sector vulnerabilities. These include corporate debt in the United States or uncertainty about future progress in trade talks during a presidential election year.
All eyes are on the Federal Reserve this week even though interest rates are expected to be unchanged. Investors are arguably focused on the central bank’s repo operations which have led to a swelling in its balance sheet. If plans of an unwinding of their liquidity-boosting efforts are expressed in further detail , that may be a trigger to further declines in the S&P 500 . That would likely further pressure NZD/JPY lower.
