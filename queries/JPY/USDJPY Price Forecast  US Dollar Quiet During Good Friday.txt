The US dollar has gone back and forth during the trading session on Good Friday, as there seems to be no serious directionality when it comes to the markets, let alone this pair. In fact, this currency pair has been very quiet as of late, and therefore I have essentially given that a “neutral rating.” This pair doesn’t necessarily make itself useless though, what I see is that it is working out quite nicely as a relative strength or weakness indicator for the Japanese yen itself. In other words, I use triangulation to form other trade ideas. A perfect example of this would be if this pair rises, while the AUD/USD rises, then it means that the Australian dollar is strengthening while the Japanese yen is falling. In other words, you should be buying AUD/JPY .
You course can do this with just about any three currencies, but in this case the thing to pay the most attention to is how the Japanese yen is behaving against the US dollar as it is the world’s reserve currency. As the market is currently trading around the ¥108.50 level, it’s basically in the middle of a larger consolidation area between ¥112 and ¥105. In other words, we are very close to “fair value.” With that in mind, there isn’t much reason to be long or short of this market right now. That being said, I do consult this chart while trading other pairs quite a bit and if we get close to the outer levels of the range, I will either be long or short of this pair. Until then, it’s simply an indicator.
