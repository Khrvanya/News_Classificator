The best trading approach here today is likely to be respecting the ranging conditions and trading reversals of big spikes after the release from resistance at or above 108.23 or support at or below 106.80.
Yesterday’s signals were not triggered, as none of the key support or resistance levels identified were reached.
Trades may only be entered between 8 am New York time Thursday and 5 pm Tokyo time Friday.

The best method to identify a classic “price action reversal” is for an hourly candle to close, such as a pin bar, a doji, an outside or even just an engulfing candle with a higher close. You can exploit these levels or zones by watching the price action that occurs at the given levels.
I wrote yesterday it seemed the 107.50 area was going to be the day’s pivotal point. I was prepared to take a bearish bias if 107.50 held up until the New York open and we saw two consecutive hourly closes below it shortly after that time. This did not happen, with the price instead just consolidating within a narrow range between 107.36 and 107.58.
This currency pair is usually very sensitive to key U.S. data releases such as the non-farm payrolls number which we will get around the New York open. This release is almost certain to see a breakout from the narrow range and possible volatile price spikes, making trading difficult at this time.
The best trading approach here today is likely to be respecting the ranging conditions and trading reversals of big spikes after the release from resistance at or above 108.23 or support at or below 106.80.
There is nothing of high importance scheduled today regarding the JPY. Concerning the USD, there will be a release of U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls data at 1:30 pm London time.
