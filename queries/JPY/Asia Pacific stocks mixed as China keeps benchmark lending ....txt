Stocks in Asia Pacific were mixed on Wednesday.
China's 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was left unchanged at 3.85%, while the 5-year LPR stood pat at 4.65%. That was largely in line with expectations from a Reuters survey of traders and analysts, where a majority forecasted no changes in either rate at the monthly fixing on Wednesday.
Investors also watched for market reaction to a STAT News report released overnight that raised concerns about the trial results for a potential coronavirus vaccine from Moderna.

That was largely in line with expectations from a Reuters survey of traders and analysts , where a majority forecasted no changes in either rate at the monthly fixing on Wednesday.
"We didn't get any easing today on the LPR, loan prime rate, but I think that's just a matter of time," Mitul Kotecha, senior emerging markets strategist at TD Securities, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday. For his part, Kotecha said he expected more easing in rates such as the LPR and reserve requirement ratio.
"I don't think China is done, by any means," Kotecha said. "I think the growth slowdown is just really getting … into action here and we've already had warnings about a weakening in trade in the next few months, so I think that certainly should be taken at face value now."
