On Thursday, GBP/JPY closed below the 50-day moving average highlighting that bears were in charge. On Monday the price declined to an over three-week low at 131.77. However, the market rallied after as some bears seemed to cover.
Yesterday, the pair retreated to the current trading zone 130.84 – 133.30 indicating that bearish momentum was still intact. Another close below the high end of the zone could encourage bears to press towards the low end of the zone. Any further close below that level could send GBPJPY even lower towards 128.84.
On the other hand, a close above the high end of the zone reflects the bear's hesitation and may cause a rally towards 135.81. Any further close above that level could extend the rally towards 137.83.
