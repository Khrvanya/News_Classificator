USD/JPY declines came to a pause as support held, EUR/JPY eyes 2019 lows
GBP/JPY at risk to losses amid Rising Wedge, CAD/JPY may trade sideways
The Japanese Yen consolidated against the US Dollar last week. This was after USD /JPY pushed above a short-term falling trend line from March 25 on the 4-hour chart below. The upper bound is a barrier between 108.48 to 108.72. The lower bound sits between 106.89 to 107.10. Guiding the pair higher may be “potential” support from last month’s bottom. A third confirmation test of the trend line may validate it. Pushing through the upper bound may see the pair revisit highs from 2019 while a turn lower exposes last year’s trough.
