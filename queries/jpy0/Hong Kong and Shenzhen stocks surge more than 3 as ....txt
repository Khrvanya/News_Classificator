Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led gains among the region's major indexes, surging 3.36% on the day to close at 23,732.52, with shares of life insurer AIA soaring 5.17%. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday he would be taking action to eliminate special treatment for Hong Kong, following China'sÂ approval of a controversial national security bill for the city.
"Admittedly, Trump's presser on action against China for implementing the Hong Kong Security Bill, which the White House has alleged strips Hong Kong of any autonomy, proved to be more bark than bite," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note.
"With specific and verifiable measures against China appearing to be weak, markets may draw hollow consolation that the US is treading carefully; especially given risks of unintended economic consequences of far more damage being caused to Hong Kong and non-negligible harm to US economic interests," Varathan said.
Mainland Chinese stocks also saw robust gains on the day, with the Shanghai composite up 2.21% to about 2,915.43 while the Shenzhen component surged 3.314% to around 11,102.15.

Data released over the weekend by China's National Bureau of Statistics showed factory activity in the country expanding in May, with the official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) coming in at 50.6. That was a decline from the 50.8 print in April and below the 51.0 level expected by analysts, according to Reuters. Still, the figure for May was above the 50 level, which separates expansion from contraction in PMI readings.
Meanwhile, a private survey also showed China's manufacturing activity expanding in May. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for May came in at 50.7, according to Reuters. That was higher than a 49.6 print expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.
