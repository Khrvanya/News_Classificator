The British Pound has been on the move a bit against the US Dollar , but appears poised to do so soon versus the Japanese Yen . GBP/JPY has been coiling up since the general election spike back on December 13. The price action is forming a descending wedge.
These types of patterns suggest a breakout is nearing as volatility contracts, and with the wedge having a flat bottom and lower-highs, the breakout is poised to be to the downside. There is very solid horizontal support around the 14120/4080-area.
A swift decline below support should have GBP/JPY rolling downhill with a level of support around 13920 up first, followed by the 200-day MA at 13757 and falling. The size and duration of the pattern suggest though a move below 13757 is in the works, with 13551 support seen as another spot of interest as support.
On the flip-side, should GBP/JPY break the upper trend-line of the wedge, a bullish breakout could carry GBP/JPY back towards the high nearing 14800. At this immediate moment, the play is to sit tight until one side or the other confirms a breakout.
