Meanwhile, a Chinese health expert said Thursday that a recent virus outbreak in Beijing is under control . The Chinese capital saw a jump in infections after more than 50 days without domestically transmitted Covid-19 cases.
"The epidemic in Beijing has been brought under control," Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said according to a Reuters translation. "When I say that it's under control, that doesn't mean the number of cases will turn zero tomorrow or the day after."
"Despite an unrelenting climb in COVID infections across (Latin America), South Asia and second wave risks hanging over US and China, global markets have regained traction; optimism even," Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note. "Simply put, markets view pandemic risks as passé, relegating them to the backseat (and rear-view mirror) as they look for an upturn ahead."
"Markets' resilience is best explained by the 'hall of mirrors' belief; where bets are that the Fed be cornered into easing effusively for the fear of disappointing markets," Varathan said, in reference to unprecedented measures taken by the U.S. central bank to support financial markets.
