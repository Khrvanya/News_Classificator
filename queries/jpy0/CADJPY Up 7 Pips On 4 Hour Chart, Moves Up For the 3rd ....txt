CAD/JPY is up 1 pips (0.01%) since the day prior (opening today near 79.318), marking the 3rd day in a row an increase has occurred. Out of the 40 instruments in the Forex asset class, CAD/JPY ended up ranking 15th for the day in terms of price change. Let’s take a look at price chart of CAD/JPY.
The first thing we should note is that the current price of CAD/JPY is sitting close to its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages; moving average crosses often indicate a change in momentum, so this may be worth keeping an eye on. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it’s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 20 day average, which is 44.1 pips away. It should be noted, though, the 20 day simple moving average turned upwards, which may be a bullish sign. Volatility for CAD/JPY has been contracting over the past two weeks relative to volatility over the past month. Whether volatility reverts will be something to watch. Trend traders will want to observe that the strongest trend appears on the 14 day horizon; over that time period, price has been moving up. Interestingly, a trend in the other direction exists on the 30 day timeframe, where price is headed down. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 30 days CAD/JPY’s price has gone up 18 them. Oh, and one last thing: if you trade off of candlesticks, note that we’re seeing pin bar pattern appearing here.
Of note is that traders in aggregate have opinions on CADJPY, with 4 buy signals on our radar and 2 sell signals. This imputes a buy/sell ratio of 2, which is bullish. As for the rationale, technical traders seem to be citing the appearance of channel and triangle technical patterns.
