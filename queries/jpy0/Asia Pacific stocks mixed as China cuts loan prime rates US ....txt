IHS Markit's Victor Shum told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Monday that there's "a lot of pressure" on crude markets, particularly in the physical oil space where the industry is "scrambling" daily to "accommodate a lot of oil flowing into a world that actually can't use it."
"We have a very skeptical audience in the oil markets even though OPEC+ members have agreed to make some historical cuts , but only starting in May," said Shum, who is vice president of energy consulting at IHS Markit.
Earlier in April, OPEC and its oil producing allies reached an agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day starting May 1.
"In the meantime, we still see oil supplies growing and traders struggle hard to find a place to store all those oil that the world doesn't need," Shum said.
