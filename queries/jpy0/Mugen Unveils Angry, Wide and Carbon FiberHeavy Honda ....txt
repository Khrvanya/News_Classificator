In 2019, Japanese automotive tuner Mugen teased a concept of what it could do to the Honda Civic Type R , and now the real car conversion kit is finally here.
Mugen is known for tuning Honda cars and was founded by Hirotoshi Honda, the son of Honda Motor Company founder Soichiro Honda, in 1973. Today, it has introduced its take on the Civic Type R, which gives the hot hatch a full body kit conversion.
You can see new panels all around the Type R. For example, there is a vented, full carbon fiber bonnet that is available for the equivalent of $10,191 USD in Japanese Yen, as well as a huge rear wing which would cost approximately $9,100 USD alone.
Elsewhere, Mugen adds a new rear diffuser that nestles a new set of twin tailpipes, as well as lower side sills, a new front lip, and carbon wing mirror covers. 20-inch forged aluminum wheels and uprated brake pads are also on offer, as is a very neat Mugen badge that can be added to the front doors. Inside you can find a new set of bucket seats, a quick-shift kit for the gearbox, and a variety of multicolored leather or carbon fiber gear knobs.
However, Mugen has not touched the two-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This means the Mugen Honda Civic Type R still produces a hearty 316 BHP and 295 lb-ft. of torque. No word has been said on the full conversion kit price, however, you can find out more on Mugenâ€™s website .
Elsewhere in the automotive world, Dodge has unleashed the Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye .
