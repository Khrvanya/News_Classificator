Easing Worries Push Investors Out of Havens, Drive Stocks to New Highs
Investors are pulling back from positions in haven assets like gold, the Japanese yen and dividend-paying stocks, a sign of mounting optimism as recent developments ease long-held worries about trade and global growth.
Gold prices have fallen around $85 a troy ounce from September’s six-year high and the value of assets held by the SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, are down nearly 7% from their October highs. Prices for silver are off nearly 15% from their September peak.
