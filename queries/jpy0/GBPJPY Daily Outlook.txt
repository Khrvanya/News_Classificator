At this point, further rise is mildly in favor in GBP/JPY for 136.34 resistance. Break there should confirm completion of the decline from 139.73 and bring retest of this high. Though, break of 131.95 will resume the fall from 139.73 to 129.27 support.
In the bigger picture, weâ€™re seeing price actions from 122.75 (2016 low) as a sideway consolidation pattern. As long as 147.95 resistance holds, an eventual downside breakout remains in favor. However, firm break of 147.95 will raise the chance of long term bullish reversal. Focus will then be turned to 156.59 resistance for confirmation.
