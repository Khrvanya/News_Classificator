AUD/JPY cleared descending ceiling â€“ is a bullish spike in the cards?
Wall Street trade ended on a rosy note, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices closing 2.32, 1.47 and 1.20 percent higher, respectively. Industrials was the leading sector in the Dow Jones, rising 6.59 percent for the day, specifically led by Aerospace and Defense. This spike came from Boeing receiving news from the Federal Aviation Administration that it was allowed to start testing flight of the 737 MAX aircraft.
US housing data also buttressed risk appetite after pending home sales on a month-on-month basis surged 44.3 percent, the highest figure ever recorded. Considering the implications of housing data for consumer confidence and economic growth , these staggering statistics appeared to play a key role in driving sentiment.

Foreign exchange markets, however, were somewhat of a mixed bag. The anti-risk Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc fell along with the Brexit-sensitive British Pound . The Australian and New Zealand Dollars were mixed, though the Danish Krone and petroleum-linked Norwegian Krone ended the day mostly higher. Crude oil along with a number of hard and soft commodities almost all ended the day in the green.
