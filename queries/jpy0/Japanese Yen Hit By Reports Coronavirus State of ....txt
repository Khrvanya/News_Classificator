Japanese Yen Technical Analysis Talking Points:
The Japanese Yen is under some fundamental pressure against the US Dollar on reports that a state of emergency could will be declared as an escalation of Japan’s coronavirus response.
The Nikkei Asian Review reported on Monday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had decided to make the declaration as Tokyo’s new-infection count continues to climb. The government will reportedly hold a meeting with experts to start preparations.
Both the Japanese Yen and the US Dollar have functioned as haven assets in the current phase of market turmoil, with the Swiss Franc also cast as ever in a similar role.
Technically speaking the Yen might still be said to be winning its haven battle with the greenback, however, as the daily-chart downtrend from mid-February’s peaks remains well above the market.
Dollar bulls have managed to keep the pair above a band of support formed by two key Fibonacci retracements of the impressive USD /JPY rise seen between March 9 and March 24. That band comes in between 38.2% retracement, 107.69 and 50% retracement at 106.45. It was quickly traded out of last week and its upper boundary would seem to be providing support now.
Of course, despite four straight sessions of gains, Dollar bulls have not made much of an advance, Resistance at March 26’s close of 109.10 still bars the way higher and, even if it breaks, the overall downtrend line doesn’t come un until 111.52, and it’s hard to see that coming under near-term threat.
Still, if the pair can hold above that resistance zone, then an attempt to retake the 111.00 handle is likely, perhaps this week.
