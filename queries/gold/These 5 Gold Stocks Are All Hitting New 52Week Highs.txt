Not all precious metals stocks are hitting 52-week highs. You have to be selective — the same as picking big tech names.
I’m not a gold bug — just interested in whatever’s making the new highs list and especially those going largely unnoticed in major media.
I do not hold positions in these investments. No recommendations are made one way or the other.  If you're an investor, you'd want to look much deeper into each of these situations. You can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments. Always do your own independent research, due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor.
