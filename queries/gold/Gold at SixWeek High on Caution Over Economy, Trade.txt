Gold prices rose to their highest level in more than six weeks, as investors remain cautious about the world economy and geopolitics despite record highs in the U.S. stock market.
Front-month gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,482.50 a troy ounce on Monday in New York, extending their advance in December to 1.2%. The haven metal is on track to rise 16% over the course of 2019, which would be its biggest one-year rally since 2010.
