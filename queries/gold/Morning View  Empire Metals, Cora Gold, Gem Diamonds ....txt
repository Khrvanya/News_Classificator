The possibly probable explanation is that Zambia which has had a rigorous BCG vaccination program for many years may have unknowingly protected its people sufficiently to fight off COVID-19.
The WHO does not recommend the BCG vaccination for treatment of COVID-19 but does recommend BCG vaccination for countries with a high incidence of TB.
It will be interesting to see if nations with high rates of TB and BCG vaccination may have lower COVID-19 fatalities.

Empire Metals* ( LON:EEE ) 1.72p, Mkt cap £3.34m - Munni Munni platinum group metals project acquisition work program
Empire Metals proposed acquisition of a 58.6% interest in Munni Munni Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Artemis Resources Limited which holds a 70% interest in the Munni Munni Palladium Project in the West Pilbara, Western Australia.
The deal will give Empire a controlling 41% interest in Munni Munni, the largest unexploited primary PGE Resource in Australia.
Management have agreed with Artemis on a 13-hole, 1,820m reverse circulation ‘RC’ work program at Munni Munni before cyclone season starts in the region.
The resource includes 12.4mt of measured, 9.8Mt of Indicated and 1.4mt of Inferred resources containing 1,140,000oz palladium; 830,000oz platinum and 152,000oz gold; and 76,000oz rhodium.
The drill program is designed to extend the strike length of the primary reef and double check assays seen in former diamond drilling.
The team are also looking for a potential second reef below the primary PGE reef.
The work should also lead to the upgrade of a JORC 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate.
Drilling is from pre-existing pads to minimise disturbance and covers 900m of strike length with multiple holes being drilled from several pads.
Conclusion: Empire Metals has acquired a meaningful stake in a potentially promising PGM project. While there is much to discover, Australian PGMs deposits have the potential to takeover from the dominant platinum mines seen in South Africa.
Australia offers a stable jurisdiction, skilled mining labour force, including many South African trained expats, cheaper capital and other incentives for the development of new mines. We suspect that any significant discovery may well attract the attention of the majors.
Cora Gold* ( LON:CORA ) 7.9p, Mkt Cap £15m – $21m funding mandate signed
Cora Gold has announced the signing of a mandate for the provision of US$21m to finance the development of its flagship Sanankoro gold deposit in southern Mali.
The agreement is comprised of three parts:
$6m equity funding to be raised at the lower of a 8% discount to the 30d VWAP on the date when the Company announces the DFS (conditions are provided below) or the lowest price Cora issued shares in the previously identified period;
$5m secured convertible loan note with a 10% coupon, three year term and a conversion price set at a 30% premium to the Equity portion issue price; investors can exercise the conversion option at any time during the term of the loan;
$10m debt funding with a 10% interest, four year term and a 1% NSR on up to 250koz of gold (Cora has an option to buyback the NSR at any time for $2m);
A fee of 1% on the $21m Project Financing will be paid by Cora to Lionhead on issue of the US$6m equity investment.
Cora producing a DFS to an internationally recognised standard (eg JORC) for +60% IRR at $1,400/oz and +6y mine life at +40kozpa (at a $1,500/oz pit shell) before the end of 2021;
In case gold price falls below $1,400/oz at any time for am identified period. Investors may terminate the agreement.
The Company is currently focussed on resource growth at Sanankoro to expand the mineral inventory base enough to support the above condition aiming for DFS from Q2/21.
The agreed funding is expected to comprise US$6m equity, US$5m of convertible notes and US$10m of debt.
Welcoming the agreement, CEO, Bert Monro, said ʺ The US$21m Project Financing will fund the Sanankoro Gold Mine based on our Scoping Study economics, following completion of a positive DFS by the end of 2021.  This is a very strong endorsement for Sanankoro from an investment group linked with our largest shareholder and a consortium of highly experienced and successful natural resources investors on competitive terms.  Sanankoro has the potential to be a highly profitable oxide mine with the Scoping Study highlighting an average free cash flow of US$24m per year and a 107% IRR at a US$1,500/oz gold price.ʺ
Conclusion: The agreement is a positive news offering funding for the Sanakoro development upon completion of the DFS and representing an endorsement by an investment group related to Cora’s largest shareholder. Subject to meeting all conditions including Sanakoro production and economics milestones, the agreement reduces the funding risk and should see Cora re-rate reducing the P/NAV discount applied to companies with development projects.
Cora Gold has secured conditional agreement on funding the US$21m capital development plan outlined in the January 2020 scoping study for Sanankoro.

Jubilee Metals Group * ( LON:JLP ) – 82p, Mkt cap £74m – Jubilee signs jv on Kabwe copper tailings processing in Zambia for 60% of earnings over life of project
Jubilee Metals have secured the right to process copper tailings held under licence by Star Tanganika Limited in Zambia.
The tailings dam has been acquired from Horizon Corp for US$5m with $0.6m in cash and $4.4m worth of Jubilee shares.
Jubilee’s local subsidiary, Braemore will have the right to 75% of all earnings from the project till 1.5x if its invested capital has been repaid and will earn 60% from the project thereafter.
The tailings dams, in Luanshya, Zambia, consists of some 150mt of tailings containing copper.
The project can produce copper in excess of the current Sable Refinery capacity of 14,000tpa of copper cathode.
Jubilee aims to increase copper production on to 25,000tpa based on feed sources and projects under review.
Jubilee sees an operating margin of >35% at current copper prices.
Management also report that Jubilee’s PGM and chrome processing operations in South Africa have returned to full capacity following their scaling back through the Lockdown.
Jubilee has £9.2m of cash after settlement of PGM and chrome rights payments in 2019 and the settlement of £2.03m of historical debt.
Premier African Minerals* ( LON:PREM ) 0.09p, Mkt Cap £11.2m – Offtake finance for Otjozundu manganese mine
Premier African Minerals reports that the offtake partners at the Otjozundu manganese mine in Namibia are undertaking a review of uncommitted credit facilities ʺwith the intention of increasing prepayment for manganese ore in two equal tranches each $300,000, in the ensuing months. This planned increase in offtake finance will ease funding requirements associated with increasing the mine production rate and help fund the lead time between production, shipment and final payment on outturn at the destination port.ʺ
Premier African Minerals owns 19% of the mine operator, MN Holdings and has an agreement for MN Holdings to provide mining equipment and professional expertise to Premier African Mining’s mining and exploration operations.
The company explains that as a result of the mitigation measures for the containment of the Covid19 virus shipments via the Okahanja siding are limited to a single load of 1405 tonnes of manganese lump ore per week.
In order to overcome this constraint, the mine plans to rail ore shipments to the port of Walvis Bay eliminating the bottleneck and ʺpotential demurrage charges associated with any rail delays or other breakdowns at the loading siding and will allow for continuous filling of containers at Walvis Bay and a much more rapid turnaround of bulk rail cars from the siding.ʺ
The company describes these measures as ʺa significant step in the eventual change to bulk shipment as opposed to containerised, with important cost and efficiency benefits.ʺ
Conclusion: Additional financial support from off-takers of manganese ore from Otjozundu for expansion of production and removing logistical constraints on ore shipment should prove positive for the 19% owned mine in Namibia.
