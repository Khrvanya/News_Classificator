Lower bond yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing gold.
Gold rose to its highest in nearly eight years on Wednesday, as demand for the safe-haven metal was boosted by worries about the global economic impact of surging coronavirus infections in many countries. Spot gold was up 0.4 per cent at $1,788.06 per ounce by 0743 GMT (12:47 pm), its highest level since early October 2012. US gold futures rose 0.4 per cent to $1,807.10 per ounce.
"Gold as a bond alternative and as a general hedge is still dominant. The macro-factor driving this right now is that there is still a high degree of uncertainty about global growth outlook going forward," said IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda.
"On top of this, while inflation expectations have picked-up a little, markets are betting that policymakers will continue to do what they can to suppress yields in order to stimulate economies and support financial conditions."
