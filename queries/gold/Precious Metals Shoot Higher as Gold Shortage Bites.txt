The price of gold and other precious metals shot higher Tuesday, lifted by robust demand for haven assets and a shortage of precious metals stemming from shutdowns at major refineries.
Front-month gold futures jumped 5.9% to $1,660.20 a troy ounce in New York, extending a surge that began Monday. Tuesday’s advance was gold’s biggest one-day increase since March 2009. Silver, platinum and palladium all rose at least 7.6%, paring some of their recent declines.
