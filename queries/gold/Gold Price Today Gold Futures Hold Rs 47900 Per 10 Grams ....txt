Gold jewellery prices vary in different parts of India - the second largest consumer of the precious metal - due to factors such as excise duty, state taxes and making charges.
In the international market, gold prices held firm on Monday, having scaled a more than one-month peak, as a resurgence of coronavirus infections in many countries raised concerns over a swift global economic recovery.
Spot gold was last seen trading 0.3 per cent higher at $1,747.59 per ounce.
Domestic share markets closed at a three-month high on Monday as domestic regulatory approvals to manufacture COVID-19 drugs lifted pharmaceutical stocks, outweighing the impact of a surge in domestic as well as global coronavirus cases over the weekend.
