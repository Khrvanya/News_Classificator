There is also a reasonable positive relation between stocks and gold prices, as shown in the chart below. Historically speaking, gold is a risk-off asset, and investors only put money into this asset when they do not believe in the stock market rally. Speaking of which, we have many investors like this today, but the quarterly performance of the US stock market says it all.
Nonetheless, the critical point to pay attention to is that the US stock market is moving higher because of monetary policy support. The reason that we see the momentum in the gold price is again for two causes. Firstly, investors do know that the Fed is going to keep their dovish monetary policy for an extended period of time, which means weakness for the dollar. A weak dollar is good for the gold price. Finally, there are many investors who have not deployed their full capital in the equity markets, and they are hedging their risk by using gold.
S&P 500 chart and gold price have started to move in the same direction.
Investors are pouring capital into gold Exchange Traded Funds. For instance, the total known gold ETF holdings are at a record level, as shown in the chart below. As long as we do not see this trend ease off, I do not see any reason why the gold price cannot continue its upward journey.
