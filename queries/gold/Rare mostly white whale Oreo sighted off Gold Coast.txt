Migaloo may have slipped past the Gold Coast undetected this year but another white whale has put on show for some very lucky spectators.
Guests onboard Sea World Cruises were treated to the extremely rare sight off Main Beach yesterday afternoon.
More than 90 per cent white, catching a glimpse of a whale like this is a once in a lifetime experience even for the experts onboard sea world cruises.

"It was very exciting and although it wasn't albino like Migaloo, it is pretty rare to see a whale like this on the water," Seaworld Cruises Marine Biologist Alana Johnston said.
The whale is named Oreo after her distinct colouring.
Scientists first spotted her in our waters last year but this trip it wasn't just the spectators excited by Oreo's presence.
She was also flanked by four humpback males who were all vying for her attention.
Sea World Marine Biologist Alana Johnston said even she was excited by the sighting. (Nine)
