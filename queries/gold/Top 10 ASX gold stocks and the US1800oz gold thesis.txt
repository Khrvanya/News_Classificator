Investors continue to dump risk assets at a rapid click.
Overnight, US markets fell precipitously. The S&P500 shed 137.63 points (-4.42%) and the NASDAQ collapsed, falling 414 points (-4.61%).
The world’s most coveted tech stocks couldn’t escape this vicious panic selling: Microsoft -7.05%, Facebook -3.78%, Apple -6.54%, Alphabet (Google) -5.39% and Amazon-4.81%.
Apple now has had over US$200 billion of its market capitalisation wiped away in under a week.
When the ASX 200 opened today, it crashed 228 points (-3.6%) in the first 30-minutes of trade.
Yet as risk assets get dumped, the expectation, at least from one of the world’s leading investment banks is that gold will move higher.
J.P. Morgan yesterday published a piece of research titled Fear and wealth: gold: the haven of last resort.
A dramatic title and a befittingly dramatic prediction: gold could soon hit US$1,800 per ounce – or roughly AUD$2,741 per ounce – at today’s exchange rate.
Analysts from the bank noted that in the last week – as the coronavirus crisis intensifies and global markets tumble – gold has predictably held up: outperforming other perceived haven currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc.
This outperformance, notes J.P. Morgan ‘underscores the fact that, with rates getting closer to their lower bound, gold looks increasingly like the safest haven.’
With the subsequent conclusion being drawn, that a combination of ‘risks to global growth surrounding the virus together with a continued savings glut, depressed real rates and increased focus on the US election should take the gold price higher by year-end.’

How much higher will the gold price run?
As a consequence of the above, J.P. Morgan analysts expect gold to hit US$1,700 per ounce in three months, US$1,750 in six and US$1,800 in a year.
Overall, higher gold prices and market uncertainty can sometimes help push gold stocks higher. We saw this on Monday: when markets crumbled, ASX-listed gold stocks rallied.
Yet this relationship is a precarious one. As Kitco commentator Lobo Tiggre punchily notes:
Such a fact was well illustrated on Tuesday. Markets continued to drop, and gold stocks fell in step. They also couldn’t be saved from the chaos today: Newcrest fell ~4%, Evolution crumbled near 5% and Regis Resources dropped ~5% – in the first hour of trade.
Even when considering this uncertain relationship; below we outline the top 10 ASX-listed gold stocks – based on market capitalisation.
