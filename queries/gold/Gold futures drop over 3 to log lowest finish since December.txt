Gold futures dropped on Wednesday , erasing their gain from a day earlier and then some, to finish at their lowest since December. "Steep losses across the equity space have forced investors to dump assets for cash to cover margin calls," said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. "An appreciating dollar also compounded gold's woes." April gold gcj20 lost $47.90, or 3.1%, to settle at $1,477.90 an ounce following a climb of 2.6% on Tuesday.
Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  declined 15.3% in trading on Wednesday after Maxim Group downgraded the stock to hold from buy. Inovio, which is developing a COVID-19 vaccine, had announced some limited, clinical data about how the candidate performed in a Phase 1 trial on Tuesday. Maxim analysts said it appears that the COVID-19 "opportunity" is already baked into the valuation as shares of Inovio have soared 593.0% year-to-date. "In our opinion, the success of INO-4800 is priced into the shares," they wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. The company's stock hit a record high of $31.69 on Monday, the day before it released the positive, yet limited data about its vaccine candidate. Inovio said that the full trial data will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The stock then tumbled after it shared the data on Tuesday, closing at $26.95. The S&P 500  is down 4.0% year-to-date.
