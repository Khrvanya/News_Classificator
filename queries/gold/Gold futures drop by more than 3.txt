Gold futures fell by more than 3% in Friday dealings , poised for their biggest one-day percentage decline since at least November 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Investors are selling "profitable positions to raise cash during a market rout," said Peter Grant, a vice president at Zaner Metals. "Frequently, the cash is used to cover margin calls in other markets." The move for gold comes against a backdrop of plunging U.S. benchmark stock indexes. April gold gcj20 fell $54, or 3.3%, to settle at $1,588.50 an ounce. It lost as much as 4.3% at one point on Friday to trade as low as $1,572.30.
