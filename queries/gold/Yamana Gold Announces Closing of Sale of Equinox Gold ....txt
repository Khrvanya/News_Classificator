TORONTO, April  15, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YAMANA GOLD INC. (TSX: YRI; NYSE: AUY) (“Yamana” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce it has closed its previously announced sale (the “Sale Transaction”) of 12,000,000 common shares of Equinox Gold Corp. (“Equinox”) and 6,000,000  warrants of Yamana to purchase common shares of Equinox to qualified purchasers for gross proceeds to Yamana of C$120,000,000 (see press release dated April 13, 2020). The shares and warrants were sold through Stifel GMP and Cormark Securities Inc.
Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to acquire one additional common share of Equinox owned by Yamana at an exercise price of C$13.50 for a term of 9 months expiring on January 15, 2021.  In the event all warrants are exercised, an additional C$81,000,000 will be paid to Yamana, for total gross proceeds to Yamana of C$201,000,000.
With the initial proceeds of C$120,000,000 (US$86,000,000) from the closing of the Equinox share sale, the Company’s preliminary cash and net debt, on a pro forma basis, as at the end of the first quarter, were over US$400,000,000 and approximately US$790,000,000, respectively, thereby providing the Company with a strong financial position complementing its operational strength.
