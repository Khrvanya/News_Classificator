Bets are being taken on which way gold prices will go with safe haven investors clashing with those who believe the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is over and markets are now in recovery mode.
Over the past three months, gold prices have ranged between $US1,700 and $US1,790 an ounce for the most part.
“It’s a huge band, but it’s also telling of the dynamics in the market,” investing.com commodities analyst Barani Krishnan said.
“The variables range from the second wave of the pandemic and the dollar debasement that could come from the trillions the US has already thrown at the problem, to a V-shaped recovery and gigantic revaluations in asset pricing that could follow.
“There is absolutely no certainty where the swinging pendulum will ultimately rest, and that’s what makes gold such an interesting watch.”
In the US, the infection rate in Texas has doubled from 4.5 per cent to 9 per cent since late May, while concerns have been raised that the UK’s move to ease travel restrictions and reopen pubs and restaurants will lead to another wave of infections.
Gold bulls will also be buoyed by the US considering new tariffs on exports from the UK, Spain, France and Germany, adding to ongoing tensions between China and the US.
Meanwhile, market pundits point to progress in the development of potential vaccine candidates with volunteers testing a new vaccine in the UK.
UK researchers have identified an old anti-inflammatory drug that improves the chances of survival for those who need oxygen or ventilators to survive, while Australian researchers have found a potential blocker that prevents COVID-19 from replicating.
China’s rapid recovery to date and the slower rate of infections in Europe have also been singled out as reasons for a broader market recovery.
