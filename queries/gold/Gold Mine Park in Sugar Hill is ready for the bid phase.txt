Although the public tends to think of Dahlonega as the gold mine center of Georgia, Sugar Hill has its own claim to fame. Many of the city’s initial settlers were in fact gold miners. These early settlers mined from Sugar Hill all the way to the Chattahoochee River.
To commemorate this heritage, Sugar Hill is building a 9.2-acre “Gold Mine Park” that will sit along Level Creek Road and serve as a trail head to the Sugar Hill Greenway. The 16-mile trail, which will circle around the city, will take hikers by one of the city’s old gold mines. Although the gold is long gone, the public can enjoy the historical view and learn about the early settlers.
Plans for the park, which are now ready for the bid phase, will include auto and bike parking, public restrooms and a picnic pavilion.
