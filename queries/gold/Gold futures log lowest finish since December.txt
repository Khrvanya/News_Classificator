Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  declined 15.3% in trading on Wednesday after Maxim Group downgraded the stock to hold from buy. Inovio, which is developing a COVID-19 vaccine, had announced some limited, clinical data about how the candidate performed in a Phase 1 trial on Tuesday.

"In our opinion, the success of INO-4800 is priced into the shares," they wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. The company's stock hit a record high of $31.69 on Monday, the day before it released the positive, yet limited data about its vaccine candidate.
