Gold jewellery prices vary in different parts of India - the second largest consumer of the precious metal - due to factors such as excise duty, state taxes and making charges.
In the international market, gold prices held steady, supported by concerns stemming from a surge in coronavirus infections in Beijing but with hopes for a potential COVID-19 drug and a stronger US dollar limiting their advance.
Spot gold was last seen trading flat at $1,727.26 per ounce, holding a narrow $6 range.
Domestic stock markets pushed higher in afternoon deals on Wednesday backed by buying interest in banking and automobile shares.
