Capital Economics expects U.S. interest rates “to remain at their lower bound going forward, so the gold price is unlikely to benefit from a further fall in rate expectations anytime soon,” said James O’Rourke, an economist at the economic research firm, ahead of the Fed news.  “Unless the virus takes a turn for the worse, we think safe-haven demand will wane too as the global economy recovers, ultimately weighing on the gold price.”
All told, “we think that stimulus-fuelled inflation is unlikely in the short or medium term,” he said in a note Wednesday. “With interest rates set to remain historically low, we expect the gold price will come under pressure from fading safe-haven demand, falling to $1,600 per ounce by year-end.”
Last week, prices for gold were slammed after a report from the U.S. Labor Department showed that 2.5 million jobs were created in May, rather than estimates for a decline in payrolls of as many as 9 million jobs on the month. Hopes that the labor market data point to a bottoming in the recession as businesses restart with the coronavirus pandemic receding in most developed countries has juiced equity values, but depressed safe-haven investments like bullion last week.
Despite some signs of economic recovery, some analysts caution that the road ahead is long and could see a resurgence of the pandemic which could wreak fresh havoc on the global economy.
Indeed, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development overnight said it expected the global economy to contract by 6% this year even if a second wave of infections is avoided, while it forecast a contraction of 7.6% in the face of a resurgence of the novel coronavirus .
