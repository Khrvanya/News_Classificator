I provided several research updates while I was bullish gold futures.
I turned bearish on Gold futures after they hit our target of 1790. You can read that post here .
Gold has now pulled back below 1700 and reversed higher, triggering an ellipse buy signal.  I think professional disciplined traders could take another long trade here with a tight stop and realistic targets.
Eventually, I think Gold will take out 1790â€¦ whether its a rally from the recent lows or from a lower level.
