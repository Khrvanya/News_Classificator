Wheaton Precious Metals Announces Record Annual Gold Production and Sales Volumes; Exceeds 2019 Production Guidance and Provides 2020 and 5-Year Guidance
VANCOUVER, Feb. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ - "Our portfolio once again delivered a strong performance in 2019 with production significantly exceeding our original guidance for the eighth consecutive year. In addition, annual gold production and sales volumes reached record levels," said Randy Smallwood, Wheaton's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The strength of our diversified portfolio was evident as exceptional results at Salobo more than offset deferrals in production at Peñasquito in 2019. We look forward to continued steady growth over the next five years from the highest-quality portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets in the streaming space."
Wheaton Precious Metals™ Corp. ("Wheaton" or the "Company") will provide full production and financial details with the release of its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results on Wednesday, March 11, 2020.
Gold Equivalent Ounces2 based on:
In 2019, production exceeded guidance primarily as a result of stronger than expected production from Salobo partially offset by unexpected, weaker production from Peñasquito due to a temporary shutdown in the year caused by an illegal blockade.
Gold Equivalent Ounces3 based on:
In 2020, gold production is forecast to remain strong primarily driven by Salobo and San Dimas. Silver production in 2020 should be stable as growth from Peñasquito is expected to be partially offset by slight decreases at Antamina and Constancia due to mine planning. At Constancia, Hudbay Minerals Inc. ("Hudbay") announced that it has secured the surface rights for the Pampacancha deposit and expects to begin mining the satellite deposit in late in 2020; however, Wheaton's forecast attributable production in 2020 currently does not include any contribution from the Pampacancha deposit4. Palladium production is expected to increase in 2020 as the Blitz project at the Stillwater mine continues to ramp up.
Average production over the next five years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from Peñasquito, Constancia and Stillwater as well as the commencement of the Voisey's Bay stream in 2021. At Peñasquito, grades are expected to increase and the addition of the pyrite leach plant is anticipated to improve recoveries. At Constancia, anticipated delay payments and production from the Pampacancha deposit is included in Wheaton's five year production average. Palladium and gold production from Stillwater is expected to increase with the continued ramp up of the Blitz project which is expected to reach full capacity in 2021. In addition, effective January 1, 2021, Wheaton will be entitled to receive from Vale an amount of cobalt equal to 42.4% of the Voisey's Bay mine cobalt production. The expansion at the Salobo mine, which will increase mill throughput capacity by 50%, is also expected to begin contributing to gold production in 2023. And lastly, Wheaton does not include any production from Barrick Gold Corp.'s Pascua-Lama project or Hudbay's Rosemont project in its estimated average five-year production guidance.

Ounces produced represent the quantity of silver, gold and palladium contained in concentrate or doré prior to smelting or refining deductions.  Production figures and average payable rates are based on information provided by the operators of the mining operations to which the silver, gold or palladium interests relate or management estimates in those situations where other information is not available.  Certain production figures may be updated in future periods as additional information is received.
Gold equivalent ounces for 2019 actual production and sales are calculated by converting silver and palladium to a gold equivalent by using the following commodity price assumptions, which were representative of spot prices at the time guidance was originally set in February 2019: $1,300 / ounce gold, $16 / ounce silver, $1,350 / ounce palladium, and $21 / pound of cobalt.
Gold equivalent forecast production for 2020 and the five-year average are based on the following updated commodity price assumptions: $1,500 / ounce gold, $18 / ounce silver, $2,000 / ounce palladium, and $16 / pound of cobalt.
As per Wheaton's precious metals purchase agreement with Hudbay, Wheaton is entitled to a delay payment payable in gold ounces from Hudbay as a result of the delay in mining the Pampacancha zone. The gold ounces delivered to Wheaton are included in the Company's production guidance.
