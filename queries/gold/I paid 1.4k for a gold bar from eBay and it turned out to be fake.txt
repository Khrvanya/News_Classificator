I spent £1,400 on a 1oz bar of Royal Canadian Mint gold from eBay, only to discover it was fake.
When it arrived I was immediately suspicious because it seemed bigger than the other 1oz gold I had already bought from a reputable bullion dealer.
I checked the Royal Canadian website for exact dimensions and its 1oz gold bar is 1.5mm thick. My bar was closer to 3mm thick.
What on earth were you thinking, buying a gold bar from eBay? Investment grade metal should only be purchased from reputable brokers or auction houses, which can verify authenticity. The online auction site has no checks in place to ensure fakes are not being flogged as the real deal.
You appear to have handed over £1,400 off the back of an unsubstantiated claim that the gold bar was originally bought in Hatton Garden and the seller saying they “had no reason to doubt this bar and it’s authenticity”. Honestly, talk about woolly.
You say you are in the process of returning the gold and you hope to get a full refund. Next time, please try and be a little bit more streetwise.
