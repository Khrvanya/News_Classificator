Gold futures climbed Thursday for a second consecutive session. "Unemployment numbers continue piling up, we're almost 100% guaranteed a recession in the near-term, and given how unprecedented this all is, I think many investors have lost confidence in the ability for anything outside of borderline risk-free assets to 'save them' from a potential next-leg-down in stocks," said Adam Koos, president of Libertas Wealth Management Group. June gold gcm20 rose $7.10, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,745.40 an ounce. That was the highest most-active contract finish since April 14, according to FactSet data.
Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  declined 15.3% in trading on Wednesday after Maxim Group downgraded the stock to hold from buy. Inovio, which is developing a COVID-19 vaccine, had announced some limited, clinical data about how the candidate performed in a Phase 1 trial on Tuesday. Maxim analysts said it appears that the COVID-19 "opportunity" is already baked into the valuation as shares of Inovio have soared 593.0% year-to-date. "In our opinion, the success of INO-4800 is priced into the shares," they wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. The company's stock hit a record high of $31.69 on Monday, the day before it released the positive, yet limited data about its vaccine candidate. Inovio said that the full trial data will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The stock then tumbled after it shared the data on Tuesday, closing at $26.95. The S&P 500  is down 4.0% year-to-date.
