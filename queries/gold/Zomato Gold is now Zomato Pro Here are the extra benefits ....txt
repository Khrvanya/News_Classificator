Online food ordering and restaurant guide Zomato today launched an upgraded  subscription package for its  popular Zomato Gold programme.
Termed as 'Zomato Pro' , the  membership programme will have                         privileges and discounts on the best restaurants across dining out and delivery, according to a statement by Zomato.
This is in addition to exclusive privileges on the Zomato app and a unique money-back guarantee for all Pro members.
All  the users of Zomato  Gold programme  will be automatically get upgraded to Zomato Pro starting 1 August.
The release said that Zomato Pro members will continue to enjoy existing offers (on Zomato Gold) across a wide selection of restaurants — from dining hotspots to legendary restaurants, cafes, bars as well as quick-service restaurants.
Zomato Pro has been designed to be much more friendly for a much wider variety of restaurant businesses. Zomato has signed up 50% more partner restaurants on Zomato Pro than what it had on Zomato Gold – across dining out and delivery.
Zomato Pro members will also get priority delivery on Zomato. It means that any order placed by a Pro member will jump to the front of the real-time queue when it looks for a Zomato Valet to deliver the  order. It will lead to the  orders getting delivered 15-20% faster (on an average)  during peak dinner times.
The Zomato Pro subscription will also  come with a  money-back guarantee scheme.
Zomato  claimed that  if a subscriber  don’t save 2x the subscription fee of Zomato Pro within the subscription period, Zomato  will auto-refund the subscription fee at the end of the year.
This money back guarantee will be applicable to all Zomato Pro/Gold memberships bought or renewed today onwards.
