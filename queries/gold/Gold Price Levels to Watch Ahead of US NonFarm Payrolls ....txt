The price of gold has traded to fresh yearly highs during every single month so far in 2020, and the bullish behavior looks poised to persist in July as the reversal from the May low ($1670) pushes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) towards overbought territory.
As a result, Chairman Powell insists that “when economic and financial conditions improve, we will put these tools back in the toolbox,” and the FOMC appears to be on track to retain the current policy at the next interest rate decision on July 29 as Fed officials show little interest for a yield curve control program .
Looking ahead, the update to the US Non-Farm Payrolls ( NFP ) report may also encourage the FOMC to carry out a wait-and-see approach as the economy is expected to add 3 million jobs in June, and the central bank may stick to the sidelines over the coming months as the update to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) show “a general expectation of an economic recovery beginning in the second half of this year.”
Nevertheless, the recent contraction in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet may prove to be short lived as the reduction is largely driven by a decline in liquidity swaps, and the low interest rate environment along with the ballooning central bank balance sheets may continue to act as a backstop for the price of goldas marketparticipants look for an alternative to fiat-currencies.
