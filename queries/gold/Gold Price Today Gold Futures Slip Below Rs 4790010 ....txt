Gold jewellery prices vary in different parts of India - the second largest consumer of the precious metal - due to factors such as excise duty, state taxes and making charges.
In the international market, gold prices steadied on Thursday as a spike in coronavirus cases dented demand for riskier assets though gains were capped by rival safe haven buying of the dollar. Spot gold was last seen trading steady at $1,762.21 per ounce, trading below its highest since October 2012 at $1,779.06, hit on Wednesday.
Domestic stock markets ended a volatile session mildly lower as investors weighed a downbeat growth outlook from the International Monetary Fund and a surge in COVID-19 cases, while gains in consumer and pharma stocks capped losses. The NSE Nifty 50 index ended down 0.16 per cent at 10,288.90, and the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex slipped 0.1 per cent to 34,842.10.
The IMF on Wednesday evening predicted the Indian economy would contract by 4.5 per cent in 2020, and said it expects global output to shrink 4.9 per cent this year - a sharper fall than the 3 per cent contraction predicted in April.
