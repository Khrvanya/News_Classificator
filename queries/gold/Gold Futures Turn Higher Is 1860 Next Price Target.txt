The past 2 months have seen several short-term trading opportunities emerge in Gold futures.
As you can see in today’s chart, the precious metal has traded in a broad, sideways range since mid-April.
But the latest reversal higher may be the impetus for Gold to move toward our long outstanding MFU-4 price target. Like others, this is a short-term “trading” opportunity.  I am using stops.
The MACD is turning up from the zero line, which is positive.
