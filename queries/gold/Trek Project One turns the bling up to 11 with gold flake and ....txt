KOM, defined as a colour picker by Trek, is more of a canvas than a theme in that it provides a templated design which allows 479,232 different combinations of colour ranging from deep matte blacks to radioactive yellows. The design features a simple diagonal intersection, either side of which can be customised to the owner's preferred colour, with the logo offering a third canvas for colour choice. All of which are then available in either gloss or matte finish and with a choice of black or chrome head tube badge.
Any of the above will set you back $1,000 or Â£1,100, depending on where you reside, when applied to the latest Emonda SLR. If none of those, the other two ICON themes, four standard themes, or additional colour-picker canvas options takes your fancy, there's always Trek's Project One Ultimate, in which you will be invited to Trek's HQ in Waterloo, WI, and work one-on-one with a designer to create a truly one of a kind machine.
