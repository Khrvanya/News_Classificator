Titan Company share falls 3% post earnings surprise in Q4; here's what brokerages say
JM Financial has a hold rating on Titan Company Ltd with a 12-month target price of Rs 1,040. The last traded stock price was Rs 977.25
Titan's annual investor 'meet' was a sombre affair this time round and no one wanted to spell out a specific growth target for this year or the next. The message , says the brokerage, was very clear. Key task at hand is to ensure businesses get back on their feet at the earliest and once the situation normalises, be aggressive on growth and market shares.
The brokerage maintained a hold rating as FY21E could be a tough year given possible spill-over effects of a locked economy on jobs, income and consumer sentiments.
Sharekhan has given a Buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,130.
Titan Company Limited (Titan) posted mixed performance in Q4FY2020 with consolidated revenue declining by 4.3% affected by the lockdown; however, high gross margin led to PAT declining by 2% to Rs 342.8 crore (better than our as well as street expectation). Post the easing of the lockdown norms, 85% of Tanishq stores and 75% of World of Titan stores are operational.
Jewellery and watches businesses are expected to come to normalcy by Q4FY2021. With strong traction to Gold Exchange Scheme, pent-up wedding demand, and gold being the safest asset class for investment, near-term growth prospects are intact for the jewellery business. Stable balance sheet and strong brand positioning would aid Titan to gain market share from smaller players. The stock has corrected by 24% in the past four months.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services said the investors should remain little cautious going ahead as the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal may be painful for the company. The June quarter of FY21 would be negatively impacted owing to the 'ineffective hedge' on account of higher gold prices, which would be reversed in subsequent quarters.
"In addition to the COVID-19 impact, higher prevailing gold prices and the likely lower share of high-value studded jewellery would weigh on profitability. Moreover, management's reluctance to reduce staff costs, while good for long term growth, would have an adverse impact on near-term profitability," Motilal Oswal added.
