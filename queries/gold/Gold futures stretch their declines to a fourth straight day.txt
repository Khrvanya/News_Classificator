Gold futures posted a decline on Wednesday , extending losses to a fourth straight session. "The fundamentals remain in favour of bulls because global sentiment remains shaky despite central banks and governments standing together in the fight against COVID-19," said Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM. "However, the metal is likely to gyrate within a range ahead of the U.S. jobs report on Friday." The most-active June gold gcm20 fell $5.20, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,591.40 an ounce.
