Gold futures fell nearly 2% on Tuesday , with prices giving back nearly all of what they gained a day earlier. "While economic growth concerns surrounding the coronavirus were the most recent impetus supporting gold prices, there is very little reason for gold prices to move significantly lower given the current global environment," said Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares. "Gold prices have benefited from three main factors, including heightened investor appetite for safe haven investments, continued accommodative fiscal and central bank monetary policies globally, and ongoing low inflation around the world," he said. For now, however, prices eased back with April gold gcj20 losing $26.60, or 1.6%, to settle at $1,650 an ounce after posting a gain of 1.7% on Monday.
Pinterest Inc. shares  are up 5% in Wednesday trading after Facebook Inc.  confirmed that it plans to shut down Hobbi, a rival app that let users track progress on creative hobbies like crafts and cooking. "We expect to have to shut down apps when they're not catching on, but we also hope to learn from these experiments so that we can build better, more interesting apps in the future," A Facebook spokesperson said of apps developed by Facebook's New Product Experimentation team. Also on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley boosted his price target on the stock. He sees room for the company to benefit from "multiple advertising product cycles" and enhanced abilities for users to shop through the platform. "Our call here is not about near-term upside for 2Q but more optimism that around the next six to 12 months, which we view as far more important than near-term risk around COVID lockdowns," wrote Walmsley, who has a buy rating on the stock. Pinterest shares have surged 64% over the past three months as the S&P 500  has added 26%.
