How Much Are Jubilee Gold Exploration Ltd. (CVE:JUB) Insiders Spending On Buying Shares?
It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Jubilee Gold Exploration Ltd. ( CVE:JUB ).
It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.
Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own companyâ€™s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.
Corporate Secretary Jeffrey Becker made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$157k worth of shares at a price of CA$0.60 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of CA$0.77. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.
Jeffrey Becker bought a total of 487.62k shares over the year at an average price of CA$0.60. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!
