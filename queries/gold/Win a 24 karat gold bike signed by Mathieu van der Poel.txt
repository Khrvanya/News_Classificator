4Gold.be, the sports supplements and Nutrigenomics company co-founded by Mathieu van der Poel , is offering its customers the chance to win a Canyon Ultimate CF SLX, custom painted using 24 karat gold leaf.
The bike was sent to Geraardsbergen-based Color Monkey , a paint shop that has previously painted bikes for Peter Sagan and Johan Museeuw. Given free rein to design a one-of-a-kind bike, Color Monkey used 24 karat gold leaf for the Canyon branding, and 4Gold logos on the top tube, head tube and chainstays.
The brand's slogan 'Dont[sic] settle for silver' adorns the seat stays, and subtle gloss and matte detailing adds to the design. The top tube of the bike has then been signed by Van der Poel himself.
