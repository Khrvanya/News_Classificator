Virgin has announced it will start flights between Canberra and the Gold Coast from July 13, three days after Queensland is set to reopen its borders to the ACT on July 10. The airline will have return flights between the destinations three days a week - Monday, Wednesday and Friday, priced from $129.  Virgin has also announced an extra 17 domestic routes and the resumption of flights to some regional areas.  The embattled airline went into voluntary administration in April with a $5 billion debt. But this week Virgin's administrators agreed to sell the airline to American private investment firm Bain Capital.  Virgin Australia group chief commercial officer John MacLeod said the airline had worked with the government to get the flights up and running again.  "We're pleased to have continued our effort with the federal government to reintroduce some services as we start to see confidence return and as each state and territory comes closer to finalising their plans for the easing of restrictions and the reopening of borders," he said.  "Many of our aircraft have been parked and our teams are preparing them to return to the skies. "With the increase in flights we're announcing today we're looking forward to serving our guests as they travel to visit family and friends or take a well-deserved break." Virgin Australia has developed a series of health guidelines for travellers. People will have to scan their own boarding passes, self check-in is encouraged and there will be no food or drinks available for purchase - but a complimentary water and snack will be provided.  Canberra Airport will also screen all passengers before they embark. It recently installed thermal cameras to detect people with fevers.
