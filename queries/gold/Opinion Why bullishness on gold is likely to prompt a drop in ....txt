When gold and gold stocks struggle in coming weeks, as I expect they will, it won’t be because the COVID-19 threat has decreased.
Instead, they will have been sabotaged by the excess bullishness that currently prevails among gold-market investors.
This isn’t to say a lessening of the virus’ threat wouldn’t also cause gold to recede from its recent seven-year high . But my argument is that gold will be weak in coming weeks even if the coronavirus remains just as much the public health emergency it is today.
To appreciate why, consider the average recommended gold market exposure level among several dozen short-term gold timers I monitor (as measured by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HGNSI). (This average is plotted in the accompanying chart.) It currently is higher than 96.4% of all daily readings of the past 20 years.
In the past, whenever the HGNSI has been this high, gold and gold-mining stocks performed poorly on average. The relevant data are summarized in the table below. It shows the returns of gold and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX,
in the wake of HGNSI readings as high as we’re currently seeing, as well as in the wake of low readings that were just as extreme at the other end of the historical distribution.
