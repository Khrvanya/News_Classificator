I don’t know exactly why Epic keeps making these hyper rare items like this, I guess just for a bit of fun, though the average player will never see one, and they will likely not turn the tide of any games. This golden mushroom in particular has some people thinking about Midas, who turned everything he touched into gold, so I suppose this could be some sort of signal that maybe he’s alive and was not in fact eaten by a shark, like we saw in the opening trailer for this season.
How to find this mushroom? Again, you probably won’t, but mushrooms spawn in usually wooded, shady areas, and there are usually a bunch of them scattered around that will give you 5 shield each, not 100 like the golden one. If you find one, please let me know on Twitter , and I will post it here.
Are there any other secret items Epic has hidden this season? There do not appear to be, but one of these is probably enough, and I’m wondering if they’re going to keep doing something like this every single season of Chapter 2. Waiting for a golden apple that spawns Trojan armies onto the map. What, no Greek mythology fans in the audience. Whatever, read a book.
