Frontier Resources (FNT) has identified a four kilometre-long gold mineralisation zone at Kimono, along the eastern boundary of the Tolukuma gold mining lease ML104.
The discovery was made from an independent analysis of historical trench, rock and soil sampling at the Kimono and Kimono South prospects.
The mineralised and anomalous zone extends for four kilometres from the Auga River at Kimono Central to upper Muile Creek at Kimono South.
This zone encompasses the known Kimono Vein, the 120 Vein and Kimono South (formerly called 'Dudu'). This zone contains wide intervals of anomalous gold in soils partly coincident with airborne geophysical anomalies that require follow‐up sampling.
Assay results include 5.90g/t gold in Outcrop number one, 34.40 and 26.2g/t gold in Outcrop number seven, and one metre at 30.10g/t gold and one metre at 17.8 g/t gold trench samples in Outcrop number five.
Newmont completed six trenches on the SE extension of the vein, including three trenches within Frontier's exploration licence EL 2531 where high-grade gold values have been indicated.
Results include 13 metres at 49.0g/t gold, 0.3 metres at 107g/t gold and two metres at 12.6g/t gold.
Tolukuma Gold Mines collected a total of six rock chip and channel samples from the 120 Vein area. Grab chip results include 9.87g/t gold, 8.22g/t gold, and 9.68g/t gold.
An independent geological report has outlined hand augering, mapping and re-sampling activities to be conducted which will define targets for drill testing.
Tolukuma Gold Mines' follow up fieldwork consisted of creek mapping, rock chip sampling, ridge‐spur soil sampling and checking three airborne geophysical anomalies.
Out of 10 drainage rock chip samples, only one assayed greater than 1.0g/t gold (hitting 8.25g/t gold). However, several creeks within the upper Muile drainage system remain un-sampled.
From the ridge‐spur soil sampling, wide intervals of anomalous gold were defined including 150 metres at 0.12g/t gold, 200 metres at 0.17g/t gold and 175 metres at 0.37g/t gold.
Further broad anomalous zones include 200-metres at 0.13g/t gold and 700 metres at 0.15 g/t gold.
The company will now undertake various fieldwork activities to define drill targets.
