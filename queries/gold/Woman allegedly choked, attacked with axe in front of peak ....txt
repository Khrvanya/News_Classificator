Bystanders held down a man who had allegedly attacked a woman with an axe in the heart of Brisbane city on Wednesday.
The incident occurred during the busy rush hour when a 29-year-old man from Wishart allegedly approached a 20-year-old Gold Coast woman at an Adelaide St carpark in the CBD, threatened her with an axe and ordered her into his car.
Struggling with the woman, who is known to the man, he allegedly slashed the woman with the axe and began strangling her.
She escaped after men nearby helped her. The men restrained the alleged attacker until police arrived and arrested him.
One of the men, a 40 year-old from Norman Park, was injured in the struggle, with a cut on the wrist. The woman had a minor cut to the back of her head and bruising on her shoulder and hands.
The 29-year-old faces two counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm, choking and entering a premises with intent and will face Brisbane Magistrates Court today.
