'Markets are impossible to guess at the moment,' he says.
'The fund is now in defensive mode, but anything could happen in the weeks ahead.' McKinnon says the emphasis is now on capital preservation.
'In the months ahead, there will be opportunities in many consumer stocks. But some of these companies, I am afraid to say, will not survive.'
The trust has £100million of borrowings waiting to be deployed when McKinnon – and the trust's board – believe stock markets have hit rock bottom.
'It's part of our firepower,' he says. While the money sits on the sidelines, it will cost £6million a year in interest charges.
With the trust having more than two years of income reserves squirreled away, McKinnon is confident its 36 years of continuous dividend increases will not be broken by recent events despite the rash of companies cancelling dividend payments.
'The board maintains that it is their wish to grow the dividend ahead of inflation,' he says.
'That very much remains in place. The trust has a strong balance sheet.'
Despite the difficult times, McKinnon says shareholders are supportive. Like most fund managers, he is working from home instead of the trust's Edinburgh's offices.
With four children aged nine to 13, he has invested in some 'noise-cancelling' headphones.
The trust's ongoing annual charge is competitive at 0.58 per cent. Income is paid quarterly and is equivalent to 3.84 per cent a year.
Over the past five years, the trust has delivered a total return for shareholders of just over 19 per cent. This compares with a rise of just under 4 per cent for the FTSE All-Share Index.
