[Update 7/1: The first batch of games are available for free now, including WRC 8 FIA World Rally Championship and Saints Row 2]
June is almost over, so it's nearly time for a refreshed Games with Gold lineup. Microsoft has announced the four games Xbox Live Gold subscribers can claim in July. Like usual, the lineup includes two Xbox One games and two backward compatible Xbox 360 games. In what's becoming a trend, July's Xbox One offerings will likely be of interest to racing and sports fans.
All throughout July, you can grab WRC 8 FIA World Rally Championship , a rally racing game that released last year. WRC 8 has a robust single-player career mode and more than 100 tracks across 14 countries. Online multiplayer boasts weekly challenges and an esports mode with tournaments. New to the series with WRC 8 is the dynamic weather system, which alters track conditions by introducing elements such as rain and snow.
The second Xbox One game, Dunk Lords , will be available from July 16 to August 16. Dunk Lords is a beat 'em up basketball game with a large cast of characters with unique attacks. It's over-the-top by design, combining arcade basketball with combat. Dunk Lords has a story mode that can be played solo or cooperatively with another player, a cooperative gauntlet mode, and an arcade mode that supports up to four players.
For the first half of the month, subscribers can claim Saints Row 2 , the Xbox 360 era open-world action game which puts in the role of the leader of the Third Street Saints. Saints Row 2 is where the franchise started to lean into a comedic tone, separating itself from the similar gameplay style of Grand Theft Auto.
And in the back half of the month, you can grab Juju , a cute platformer starring a shaman panda and his lizard pal Peyo.
Some of June's freebies are still available now, so don't forget to grab them before they're gone. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse and Sine Mora are free until June 30, while Coffee Talk is free until July 15.
