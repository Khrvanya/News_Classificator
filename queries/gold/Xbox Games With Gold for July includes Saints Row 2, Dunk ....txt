Xbox One players with Xbox Live Gold will gain access to four games this July as part of the Games with Gold program. WRC 8 FIA World Rally Championship, Dunk Lords, Saints Row 2, and Juju will be available next month for players who are part of the subscription service.
While players who are a part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate have access to a larger library of games on a permanent basis, the Games with Gold program offers a temporary window in which to sample games on both the Xbox One and 360.
July’s Games With Gold schedule is as follows:
WRC 8 FIA World Rally Championship, a realistic rally car simulator, will be available July 1 to 31 on Xbox One.
Dunk Lords, a two-on-two basketball beat ‘em up game with 20 characters and a story mode, will be free from July 16 to August 15 on Xbox One.
Saints Row 2, a classic open world crime game that takes place before the Saints Row franchise went off the rails and into space, will be available July 1 to 15 on Xbox One and Xbox 360.
Finally, Juju, a cartoon-y platformer, will be available from July 16 to 31 on Xbox One and 360.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate combines Microsoft’s online service, Xbox Live Gold, and the game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass.
