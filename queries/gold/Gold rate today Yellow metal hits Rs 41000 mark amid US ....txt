Traders' flight to safety pushed gold to record highs on domestic bourses as tensions between the United States and Iran escalated over the weekend.
US said it detected a heightened state of alert by Iran's missile forces, as President Donald Trump warned that US would strike back, "perhaps in a disproportionate manner," if Iran attacked any American person or target.
Iran also said it was ramping up its nuclear program. It announced its fifth step back from a nuclear deal saying it will forego the "limit on the number of centrifuges" that was mandated in the deal.
