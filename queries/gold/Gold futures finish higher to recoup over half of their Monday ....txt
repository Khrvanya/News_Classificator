Gold futures finished higher Tuesday to recoup just over half of what they lost a day earlier, when positive results for an experimental COVID-19 vaccine fed a rally in the stock market. The Federal Reserve is "far from done with pumping stimulus into the economy and gold prices are liking that," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. June gold gcm20 rose $11.20, or nearly 0.7%, to settle at $1,745.60 an ounce.
