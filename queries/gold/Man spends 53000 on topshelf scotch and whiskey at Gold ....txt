A man has left employees of a Gold Coast liquor stored stunned after dropping a cool $53,000 on alcohol over a two-day period.
A Mermaid Waters outlet of Dan Murphy’s was the beneficiary of the man’s largesse, according to local news website MyGC .
The man spent the phenomenal amount on very expensive bottles of premium American Scotch and Irish Whiskey.
“He is a local whiskey enthusiast, and is the most polite gentleman I have ever met,” Dan Murphy’s staff member Matt Loth told MyGC.
“He said he does collect to some extent, but he’s more passionate about enjoying a world-class tipple and sharing with friends and family.”

On the list was super-expensive American bourbon Pappy Van Winkle’s.
“These are collector’s items, so we are lucky to get our hands on some stock each year for customers,” Mr Loth said.
