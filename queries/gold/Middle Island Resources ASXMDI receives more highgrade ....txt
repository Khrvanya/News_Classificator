Over 12,000 metres of drilling have been completed at Ridge, where a program is ongoing to better understand the deposit
Middle Island Resources (MDI) has announced further high-grade results from infill and extension drilling at the new Ridge deposit within the Sandstone Gold Project in WA.
The phase two reverse circulation (RC) drilling program is designed to infill and extend existing and new deposits that were defined in the phase one program earlier this year. The overarching goal is to define its gold mineral resources to an indicated classification.
The new Ridge results lie just northeast of the Sandstone gold processing plant and on permitted Mining Lease M57/129.
The latest results are derived from two holes; one from MSRC544 and the other from MSRC545. Both holes were drilled towards the southern end of the Ridge satellite gold deposit.
MSRC544 includes a shallow intercept of four metres at 50.5g/t gold from three metres, including one metre at 198g/t gold from four metres.
MSRC545, drilled 20 metres directly behind and down dip from MSRC544, includes nine metres at 5.41g/t gold from 22 metres.
These results follow a recent bonanza grade result in MSRC530 of four metres at 99.5g/t gold from 13 metres, including one metre at 390g/t gold (a repeat assay of 502g/t gold) from 14 metres.
Roughly 12,000 metres of the phase two drilling program have now been completed, and the program continues on schedule.
While these results are extremely encouraging, further results are required to fully understand the context of bonanza grade intercepts in MSRC530 and MSRC544.
