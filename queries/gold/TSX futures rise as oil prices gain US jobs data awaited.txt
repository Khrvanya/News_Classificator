(Reuters) - Canada's main stock index futures rose on Thursday, helped by higher oil prices and as investors awaited the monthly U.S. jobs report for signs of an economic rebound following the easing of coronavirus-led lockdowns.
The U.S. Labor Department's employment report is likely to show record growth in jobs in June, although a surge in COVID-19 cases is threatening the fledgling recovery.
Meanwhile, oil prices gained as a sharp drop in oil stockpiles outweighed concerns that the spike in infections and new lockdown measures in California could stall recovery in fuel demand. [O/R]
