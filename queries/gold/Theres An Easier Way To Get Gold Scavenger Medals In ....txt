In Season X, Fortnite changed how it presented its challenges. No longer would it just drop a whole list of challenges at once: now they came as part of “missions”, which would unlock sequentially, with more challenges coming up as you completed early objectives. It can be tough, especially if you’re waiting to get to more fun challenges as you’re stuck on some particularly annoying combat challenge. Such is the case with “Rippley vs. Sludge”, which frontloads with some more involved, medal-earning challenges. One, in particular, isn’t a combat challenge but can actually be a little bit daunting: earning gold scavenger medals. Here’s how to get your mind around that one.
To get a gold scavenger medal, you need to open up 12 chests, supply drops or loot llamas. It’s tougher than it seems: you’re unlikely to do this in the course of regular combat, and even doing it intentionally can be tricky. And Team Rumble can actually make it harder, because you’ll have less time to loot at the edges of the map before you have to make your way in.
It’s all about selecting where you want to go. In a basic way, what you want to do is this: select a named point of interest as far away from the path of the Battle Bus as possible. Land down there and get searching as efficiently as you can: if you don’t hear that telltale shimmer, move on. Avoid combat and keep doing that as you move to the safe zone.
