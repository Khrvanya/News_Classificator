To give a fillip to the gold investments, the government had also introduced sovereign gold bonds, which are government securities denominated in grams of gold. The SGB provided gold buyers with a substitute for holding physical gold as investors were shielded from the risks and costs of storage and were free from issues like making charges and purity in the case of gold in jewellery form. SBI added that it mobilised 647 kg gold through sovereign gold bonds in the last fiscal.
Meanwhile, the ongoing economic crisis in India has severely hit the gems and jewellery industry. Despite being one of the largest gold importers in the world, India did not import nearly any gold in the month of April. India’s gold imports plunged 99.9 per cent on-year in April to their lowest in nearly three decades. Restriction on the movement of goods and the nationwide lockdown leading to the closure of jewellery shops were attributed to the near-nil gold imports. Even as India is the second-largest consumer of gold, it imported only 50 kg of gold, compared to 110.18 tonnes a year ago.
