Toronto, ON / June 26, 2020 / JMN Wire / With coronavirus still affecting supply lines and institutions racing to buy precious metals, the window for jumping on board the gold and silver train is closing.
On this edition of the Weekly Wrap-up, host Craig Hemke and legendary investor Eric Sprott break down all the gold and silver news you need, including:

“Things have been great in the precious metals area and lots of people are predicting higher prices. We’re getting the mainstream financial organizations recommending gold. And of course they typically say, well, ‘5 or 10% of your portfolio.’ And as the gold stocks, I think, start outperforming the market, which they’ve certainly done this year, they will probably continue to lean toward higher weightings… Some of us hog the puck in owning gold and gold shares... and you ain’t getting it out of our hands! So it’s going to be very difficult for people to fully participate in this.”
