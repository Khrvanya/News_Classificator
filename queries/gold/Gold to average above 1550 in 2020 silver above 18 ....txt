( Kitco News )  - The average prices of the four main precious metals in 2020  are all expected to post double-digit gains over the actual average for 2019,  although most of these forecasts are fairly flat compared to where prices were  early in the year, according to a survey of analysts by the London Bullion  Market Association (LBMA) released Monday.
The average price forecast for gold in 2020 was $1,558.80 an  ounce, which is 11.9% higher than the $1,392.60 actual average in 2019 but only  modestly above the $1,554.20-per-ounce average for the first half of January.
Silver is seen averaging $18.21 in 2020, which is 12.4% above  the 2019 actual average of $16.20. The metal averaged $18.08 an ounce in the  first two weeks of January.
The LBMA also tabulated what analysts expect to be the top  drivers for gold prices in 2020. Thirty-eight percent said geopolitical and  economic tensions, such as U.S. elections, Brexit and the ongoing trade war.  Another 35% said monetary policy, particularly in the U.S., which in turn  affects the strength of the U.S. dollar. Fifteen percent of respondents listed  “changes in demand,” especially in the top two gold-consuming nations of India  and China.
Rene Hochreiter  of Noah Capital Markets/Sieberana Research Pty Ltd. and Rhona O’Connell of INTL  FCStone were the winners of the LBMA’s annual gold-forecasting contest for  2019. For the current year, Hochreiter listed an average forecast of $1,670 an  ounce, while O’Connell listed  $1,590.
“Iran could be  the spark that ignites the gold price, but then numerous factors could equally  do the trick,” according to comments attributed to Hochreiter in the LBMA  report. “It is now 10 years since the gold price hit $2,000/oz on intra-day  trading and the likelihood of a run this year is quite high. Technically, gold  broke through resistance at around $1,320/oz in June 2019 and is now in ‘full  bull’ mode, trading a respectable $130/oz above its 200 DMA [200-day moving  average]. This could continue for some considerable time, perhaps most of  2020.”
The LBMA report  has O’Connell listing both bearish and bullish influences for gold. On the  bearish side, the analyst cited less official-sector buying although still a  historically high level, a large “overhang” in bullish futures positioning that  means potential selling whenever these traders finally exit, and reduced  economic worries if the U.S. and China resolve their trade issues.
On the bullish  side, O’Connell cited negative European interest rates, geopolitical risk “that  has not gone away,” and a lack of buying from retail investors that could mean  “a very substantial degree of pent-up demand waiting to be unleashed once  retailers finally get used to higher prices, which is taking a lot longer than  usual.”
Independent analyst Ross Norman (winner for palladium in the  2019 survey) is the most bullish gold analyst for 2020 with his average call of  $1,755 an ounce, while Bernard Dahdah (last year’s winner for silver and  platinum) has the lowest annual average gold forecast at $1,398.
Analysts collectively called for platinum to average  $1,005.10 an ounce this year, a 16.5% gain from the 2019 actual tally of  $862.90. This metal averaged $973.60 during the first two weeks of the new  year.
Palladium – the high flyer in 2019 – was seen averaging  $2,116 in 2020, which would be a gain of 37.7% above last year’s actual average  of $1,536.70. The average for the first two weeks of January was $2,065.20.
