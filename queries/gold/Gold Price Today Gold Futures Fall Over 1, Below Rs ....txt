Gold jewellery prices vary in different parts of India - the second largest consumer of the precious metal - due to factors such as excise duty, state taxes and making charges.
In the international market, gold prices dropped on Monday, as the dollar hovered close to a more than one-week high, despite fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections in Beijing denting risk appetite.
Spot gold was last seen trading down 0.5 per cent at $1,720.56 per ounce.
Domestic equity markets slid more than 2 per cent as a rise in domestic coronavirus cases and worries over a second wave of infections in China sapped investors' appetite for riskier assets.
