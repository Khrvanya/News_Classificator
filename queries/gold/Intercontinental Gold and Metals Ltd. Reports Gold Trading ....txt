2020 Revenue Guidance Withdrawn Temporarily - COVID-19 has adversely affected the global economy and normal business activities. Our Bolivian operations have been temporarily closed due to a nationwide quarantine, workplace restrictions and travel bans since March 21, 2020. We anticipate business operations will re-open prior to the end of June 2020, however the resulting impact will be approximately one full quarter of lost revenue. While we expect business activity and gold purchases and exports to return to normal levels there could be future COVID-19 outbreaks requiring new quarantines and business restrictions. As such we will not provide revenue guidance at this time.
