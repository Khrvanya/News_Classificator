A new capital hotel has covered its facade, as well as other amenities, in real gold to reel in glitzy lodgers.
Located by a lake in Ba Dinh District, the 25-floor hotel is covered in 5,000-square-meters of gilded ceramics. According to its developer, this is the world’s first hotel having its facade gold-plated.
The luxury hotel was scheduled to open in time for the Formula One race in Hanoi in April, which was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Many internal design features are also covered in real gold, a challenging operation according to builders.
