Gold Glistens on Coronavirus Fears: 6 Stocks to Buy
The whole world is currently on edge with the coronavirus-induced crisis showing no signs of letting up, which has only added more fuel to apprehensions regarding the global economic growth. This, in turn, has sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets like gold. Notably, the yellow metal has yielded a return of 7.5% year to date.
First detected in Wuhan in December the coronavirus rapidly took the shape of a pandemic. Per the World Health Organization’s situation report as of Apr 6, 2020, number of infected people across the globe is currently at 1.2 million with the death toll at 77,200. The United States is the worst affected, with 307,318 cases, followed by Spain with 130,759 and Italy with 128,948.
The Fed has slashed interest rates to zero and intends to buy at least $700 billion in government and mortgage-related bonds as part of a wide-ranging emergency action to protect the economy from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. This marked an unprecedented move by the U.S. central bank since the 2008 financial crisis. This has fueled the yellow metal’s prices as gold tends to attract buyers in a low interest-rate environment.
Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics latest report, the U.S economy shed 701,000 jobs for the first time in a decade on account of its efforts to contain the virus. Leisure and hospitality accounted for 65% or 459,000 of the job cuts. The unemployment rate shot up to 4.4% — the highest unemployment rate since August 2017. The 0.9 percentage point rise in the unemployment rate marked the largest over the month increase in the rate since January 1975.
Manufacturing index in March as per the Institute for Supply Management’s latest report was at 49.1% — contracting again after two months of expansion. Contraction was noted in production, new orders, and employment. The manufacturing sector has clearly been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and energy market volatility.
All these developments further boosted gold prices, which has been gaining steadily this year — starting with the U.S-Iran tensions and now the coronavirus-scare. Further, lower oil prices and fears of supply crunch as miners are halting their operations as per government mandates have contributed significantly to the price movement. On Apr 6, future price of gold for June delivery increased 2.6% to settle at $1,693.90 an ounce.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) anticipates annual global GDP growth will likely drop to 2.4% in 2020 — the lowest rate since 2009. According to the body, in the case of a more intensive coronavirus outbreak, spreading widely throughout the Asia Pacific region, Europe and North America, the global growth could drop to 1.5% in 2020. The uncertainty regarding virus's impact on the global economy and the governments’ stimulus measures should keep supporting gold. It will continue to be the preferred investment option supported by the environment of low interest rates and virus-induced global slowdown.
