Metal Bank (ASX:MBK) has reported drilling results at its southeast Queensland project, 8 Mile, which lies close to one of Evolution Mining’s (ASX:EVN) richest projects.
At Metal Bank’s Flori’s Find prospect the best results included 16m at 1.9 grams per tonne (g/t) from 69m and 12m at 2.1g/t gold from 4m.
At the Perry prospect results included 6m at 1g/t gold from 105m, 3m at 2.2g/t gold from 72m and 6m at 3.4g/t gold from 4m.
The project lies near the famous Mt Rawdon gold mine currently operated by mid cap Evolution Mining (ASX:EVN). According to Evolution, this mine has produced over 50 tonnes of gold since operations began.
It delivered $60m in full mine operating cash flows and $31.6m in net cash flows and is expected to deliver another 90,000 ounces this financial year.
In an investor presentation at the Queensland Exploration Council in September, Metal Bank all but said the mine would be Queensland’s next big gold story, noting it had gone from an opportunity to a drilled discovery in (then) less than 10 months.
Metal Bank shares gained 25 per cent this morning.
