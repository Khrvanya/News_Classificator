Yamana Gold Inc. AUY recently declared that it has closed its previously-announced sale of 12,000,000 common shares of Equinox Gold and 6,000,000 warrants of Yamana to acquire Equinox’s common share to qualified purchasers for C$10 per unit or gross proceeds of C$120 million.
Notably, the shares and warrants were sold through Cormark Securities and Stifel GMP.
Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional common share of Equinox, owned by Yamana, at an exercise price of C$13.50 for nine months expiring on Jan 15, 2021. Yamana will receive total gross proceeds of C$201 million in case all the warrants are exercised.
With the initial proceeds of C$120 million from the closure of the Equinox shares, the preliminary cash and net debt of Yamana, on a pro forma basis, were more than $400 million and around $790 million, respectively, at the end of the first quarter. Hence, this offers Yamana a solid financial position that complements its operating efficiency.
Shares of Yamana have surged 95.5% in the past year compared with 57% growth of the industry.
The company recently announced preliminary production results for first-quarter 2020.
In the first quarter, the company produced 192,238 ounces of gold and 2.73 million ounces of silver. Total gold equivalent ounces (GEO) produced in the quarter were 221,746.
Cost of operations in the first quarter was in line with the company’s expectations. Moreover, costs were favorably impacted in the quarter by foreign exchange swings. Overall, sales of gold and silver in the first quarter were roughly equal to production figures.
In fact, Yamana is likely to have witnessed a strong financial performance in the to-be-reported quarter, partly owing to net debt reduction.
