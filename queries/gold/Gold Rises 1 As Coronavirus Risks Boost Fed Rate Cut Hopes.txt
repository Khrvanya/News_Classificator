Pinning hopes on a rate cut by US Fed Reserve amid the coronavirus scare, gold prices witnessed a rebound on Monday.
Gold rose more than 1 per cent on Monday, rebounding from a steep decline across precious metals in the previous session, amid investor hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to cushion the impact of the fast-spreading coronavirus.
Spot gold gained 1.2 per cent to $1,603.19 per ounce by 2:30 pm. US gold futures rose 2.5 per cent to $1,606.00.
Gold prices plunged over 4.5 per cent on Friday, with precious metals joining a broader market selloff as investors liquidated positions to meet margin calls in other assets.
"On Friday, the US Federal Reserve board hinted they're going to be dropping interest rates and that's a great thing for gold right off the bat," said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that while the US economy remained strong, the coronavirus "posed an evolving risk" and the central bank stood ready to take action if needed.
Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
Fed fund futures showed that traders expect a 75 basis point rate cut by the US central bank at its March monetary policy meeting.
