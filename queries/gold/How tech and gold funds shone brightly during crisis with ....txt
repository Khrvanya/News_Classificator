And since the wider stock market began to recover from its pandemic low in late March, MFM Junior Gold and ES Gold and Precious Metals have made investors more money than any other fund.
US-focused funds, which have long benefited from the rise of tech titans like Google and Amazon, also continued to rake in the money throughout the pandemic.
Even though stock markets have been jittery, tech firms have been largely unaffected by the coronavirus worries.
Some, such as video conferencing firm Zoom, have even reaped the benefit of more people working from home.
