Yellow metal loses 3.7% for the month, pares quarterly gain to 3.4%
Gold prices dropped over 2% Monday, settling below the psychologically important level of $1,500 to post their lowest finish in two months, as strength in U.S. dollar and some buoyancy in U.S. stocks and yields drew demand away from bullion.
“Naturally, a strong U.S. dollar is a headwind for gold priced in U.S. dollars,” said Michael Armbruster, managing partner at Altavest.
“However, technical considerations may be more influential on today’s action in the gold market,” he said. “Gold has formed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, and today’s drop below the formation’s ‘neckline’ has likely spurred additional selling.”
“In the short-run, gold could follow through to lower levels on a purely technical basis,” Armbruster said, though long-term prospects remain bullish for gold based on easy money central bank policies.”
