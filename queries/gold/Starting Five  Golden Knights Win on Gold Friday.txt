Look back at this shootout win against Arizona from Nov. 29
On the day after Thanksgiving, the Vegas Golden Knights showed what Gold Friday is all about with a 2-1 shootout win against the Arizona Coyotes. Fans flocked to The Arsenal and Armory in the wee hours of the morning to lineup for exclusive items before packing The Fortress for an afternoon tilt with the Arizona Coyotes.
Alex Tuch had it all working for him on this one. He used a shot fake, his long reach and a dash of patience to bury the game-winner in this shootout.
Tuch didn't just score the shootout-winner. He also netted the only goal for Vegas in regulation on this deft deflection.
It's not every day that a tennis star stops by your hockey game. Genie Bouchard was on hand to watch the win and she fired up the crowd before the opening faceoff.

Fans started lining up as early as 3 a.m. to be the first to shop for exclusive VGK items at The Arsenal for Gold Friday. Special items included a limited-edition Marc-Andre Fleury poster, VGK bicycles, holiday sweaters and more!
No one is happier about team success than Mark Stone. Whether he's on the ice or not, you can bet his goal celebration will always be on point.
