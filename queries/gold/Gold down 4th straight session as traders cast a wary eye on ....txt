Gold futures on Wednesday started the month with a loss, stretching their decline to a fourth straight session, as traders cast a wary eye on the latest U.S. economic data amid the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has helped to partly support gold buying or at least limited downside for the precious metal.
Equity markets are “down on dire modeling predictions” from U.S. officials Monday on the number of potential deaths in the nation from the coronavirus pandemic, said Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc.
U.S. economic data Wednesday came in better than expected, but analysts said they don’t include much of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Earlier Wednesday, a report on private-sector employment from Automatic Data Processing Inc. ADP,
helped give gold prices a modest push higher. The report found that 27,000 jobs were lost in the month , smaller than forecasts from economists surveyed by Econoday who expected a decline of 180,000, but likely a harbinger of what is to come after jobless claims last week produced a record 3.28 million claims for the period .
“Common sense” says there were more than 27,000 jobs lost in March, “so data is lagging badly,” Wright told MarketWatch.
For now, he sees gold hovering around $1,600 and still in $1,550-1,650 trading range near term, but added that panic selling of gold could be over as fundamentals come back to being relevant.
June gold US:GCM20 on Comex fell $5.20, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,591.40 an ounce. That marked a fourth decline in a row for the contract. Based on the most-active contracts, gold futures rose 1.9% in March and gained 4.8% for the quarter, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Moves for gold came as global stocks were under renewed pressure amid growing concerns about the economic implications for the epidemic which are hard to fathom for investors. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that a “very, very painful” two weeks lies ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The White House released new projections for 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus pandemic even if current social-distancing guidelines are maintained.
Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases world-wide have risen to 862,234 on Wednesday, while the number of deaths have climbed to 42,404, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
“Gold prices should rise as the virus spread is intensifying alongside lockdown efforts to mitigate it,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a Wednesday research note. He said that gains for bullion are likely supported by fears the measures being implemented to prevent the spread of the deadly infection will result in a global recession, a boon for gold buyers.
May silver US:SIK20, meanwhile, settled 17.2 cents, or 1.2%, lower at $13.984 an ounce to start the new month and quarter. Based on the most-active contracts, silver lost about 14% for the month and saw a quarterly decline of 21%.
Among other metals, May copper US:HGK20 shed 2.4% to $2.1745 a pound. July PLN20,
lost 1.7% to $717.80 an ounce and June palladium US:PAM20 lost 7.1% to $2,140.80 an ounce.
The second quarter comes to the close, and an uncertain last half of the year is looming. Our call of the day comes from JPMorgan Chase strategists, who identify which stocks are winning now and are probably the safest bets for the rest of the year.
