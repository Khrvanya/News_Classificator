Gold futures end higher for a second session, extend gains after FOMC minutes
Gold futures posted a second straight session climb on Wednesday , then extended those gains after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's April meeting showed that Fed officials discussed being more explicit about the future path of interest rates. "Gold should remain in fashion despite governments relaxing lockdown measures," said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM, with the precious metal poised to find support from "global growth fears, lower interest rates and fears around a second wave of coronavirus outbreak." June gold gcm20 was at $1,753.40 an ounce in electronic trading, after settling at $1,752.10, up $6.50, or 0.4%, for Wednesday's session.
