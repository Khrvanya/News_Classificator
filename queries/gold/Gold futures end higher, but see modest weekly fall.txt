Gold futures ended higher on Friday as a drop in March U.S. employment helped to lift demand for the haven metal. For the week, however, prices for the most-active futures contract edged down by roughly 0.5%. "Gold's upside price bias has been restrained by the deflation scare running through financial markets," said Michael Kosares, founder of USAGOLD. June gold gcm20 rose $8, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,645.70 an ounce.
Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.  declined 15.3% in trading on Wednesday after Maxim Group downgraded the stock to hold from buy. Inovio, which is developing a COVID-19 vaccine, had announced some limited, clinical data about how the candidate performed in a Phase 1 trial on Tuesday. Maxim analysts said it appears that the COVID-19 "opportunity" is already baked into the valuation as shares of Inovio have soared 593.0% year-to-date. "In our opinion, the success of INO-4800 is priced into the shares," they wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. The company's stock hit a record high of $31.69 on Monday, the day before it released the positive, yet limited data about its vaccine candidate. Inovio said that the full trial data will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The stock then tumbled after it shared the data on Tuesday, closing at $26.95. The S&P 500  is down 4.0% year-to-date.
