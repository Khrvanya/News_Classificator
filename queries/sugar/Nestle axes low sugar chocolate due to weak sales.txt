Nestle has axed its range of chocolate that used a new low-sugar technique, less than two years after it was launched.
The bars used what Nestle described as "hollow" sugar crystals to cut the amount of sugar by almost a third.
Confectionery makers have come under pressure from health authorities to cut the amount of sugar in their products.
Nestle's Milkybar Wowsomes was the first product to use technology developed by the company that creates sugar with a more porous structure, which it likened to hollowing out the sugar crystals.
Some industry experts had seen the discovery as a breakthrough that would help Nestle take a leading position in a growing market for low-sugar products.
At the time of the launch Stefano Agostini, Nestle's chief executive for UK and Ireland, said: "A new product like Milkybar Wowsomes introduces greater choice and allows parents to treat their children with chocolate that tastes great but has less sugar.
"We are demonstrating how we can, and will, contribute to a healthier future and that we take our public health responsibilities very seriously," he added.
