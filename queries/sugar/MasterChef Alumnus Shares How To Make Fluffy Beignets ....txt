If you have a sweet tooth or just love snacking, we've got a recipe you're gonna want to bookmark!
Beignets. They're square-shaped. They're airy. And they taste like fluffy pillows dusted with icing sugar.
Speaking to SAYS, MasterChef alumnus Karmen Lu shared her beignet recipe but with an added twist – salted gula Melaka caramel!
These are the ingredients you'll need:
This recipe can make 14 pieces.
Ingredients (clockwise from left): coconut cream; flour, baking powder, and salt; yeast and sugar.
Combine coconut cream, yeast, and sugar in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes.
Then, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Once mixed, add it into the first bowl with coconut cream.
Mix until a ball of dough is formed and knead for a couple of minutes until smooth. Cover and let it rest for one hour.
Melt the gula Melaka on low heat until most of the lumps are gone.
Increase the heat, add the coconut cream and salt, and bring it to a boil. Reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes until thickened. ﻿
Step three: After an hour, the dough should have almost doubled in size. Place it in the fridge for 30 minutes – this will make it slightly firmer and easier to roll.
