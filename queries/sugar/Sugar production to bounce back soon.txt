Though the next monsoon season will decide the final size of India's next sugarcane crop, industry leaders say that at present, India is likely to produce about 30 million tonnes of sugar in 2020-21 as against 26 million tonnes expected in 2019-20.

Though the next monsoon season will decide the final size of India's next sugarcane crop, industry leaders say that at present, India is likely to produce about 30 million tonnes of sugar in 2020-21 as against 26 million tonnes expected in 2019-20.
During past 8 to 9 years, India has become net surplus sugar producer of sugar breaking the infamous sugar production cycle of few years of surplus production followed by a few years of shortages, which used to influence sugar prices in big way.
Since last year, central government has extended incentives to help the sugar industry deal with excess sugar production. In the ongoing sugar season, dip in sugar production of India along with Thailand has helped global move prices upward.
Vivek Pittie, president, Indian Sugar Mills Association ( ISMA ) said, “Due to good rainfall this year, area under sugarcane will increase in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamilnadu next year.”
World Sugar Organisation, which expects India’s sugar production to bounce back in 2020-21, has said that the country had become third largest sugar exporter in 2019-20.
Uttar Pradesh, which always used to be the second highest sugar producer, has become the top sugar producer thanks to use of a new high yielding variety, India is likely to remain a structural sugar exporter, not just an occasional player.
