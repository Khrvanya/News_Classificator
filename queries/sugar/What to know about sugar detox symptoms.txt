These symptoms are usually mild and temporary. They should subside without treatment after the body adjusts to lower sugar intake.
Numerous scientific studies have found evidence to suggest that sugar produces physiological and behavioral effects, similar to those caused by addictive drugs.
In a 2016 animal study , researchers found that long term exposure to high quantities of sugar causes brain changes, similar to those associated with nicotine addiction .
Several animal studies have found that when deprived of sugar, rats showed opiate withdrawal symptoms, such as anxious behavior and a decrease in dopamine release. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that controls pleasure and reward-motivated behavior.
When people drastically reduce their sugar intake, they may experience withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, cravings, and mood changes. These should go away within a few days or weeks.
Many of the symptoms associated with sugar detoxes occur as a result of fluctuating blood sugar levels. When a person eats sugar, their body breaks it down into glucose, which the cells use for energy.
In most cases, consuming sugar causes and an initial boost of energy followed by a rapid decrease in energy, or a blood sugar “crash.” People can minimize the adverse effects of sugar detoxing by regulating their blood sugar. Eating regularly and including more fiber in the diet can help avoid spikes and drops in blood sugar and decrease cravings.
Magnesium-rich food may help reduce symptoms of headaches and migraines.
Magnesium is an essential mineral that promotes numerous bodily functions, such as protein synthesis and blood sugar regulation.
According to the findings of one 2016 systematic review , people at risk of diabetes show improved blood sugar levels 2 hours after taking magnesium supplements.
Recommended dietary intakes for magnesium range between 310 milligrams (mg) to 420 mg per day for adults over the age of 19.
Rich sources of magnesium include:
