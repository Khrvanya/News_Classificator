Centre has urged the mills for diversion of excess sugarcane and sugar for production of fuel Ethanol as a long term solution for addressing the problem of excess sugar stock. “It is already well accepted by the ISMA, as augmentation in Ethanol capacity for the upcoming years is at different stages of progress / implementation. But, we believe that the three stakeholders i.e. sugar mills, OMC’s and commercial banks should enter into a tripartite agreement for optimum utilization of the policies and incentives to increase the production of Ethanol in coming years,” ISMA said.
