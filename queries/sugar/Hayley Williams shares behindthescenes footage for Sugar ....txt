The track was taken from the former Paramore singer’s stunning debut solo effort Petals for Armor, a record which was released in May and arrived as arguably the most complete piece of work that Williams has created in her career to date.
The behind-the-scenes footage Williams working in her studio as well as going for a well-earned nap, eating a mango sorbet at home and reading lyrics on her laptop, the video for the song was compiled over different nights and takes ahead of quarantine.
Speaking of the record, Williams said: “There are a lot of themes covered on the album as a whole and I thought it best to separate some of these themes so that there can be time for everyone to digest some of the songs before we move along to others,” she said in a press release of the record. “It’s a way to include people on the journey in the same way that I experienced it.
“I’m so ready and so incredibly humbled to get to share this project,” Williams previously said. “Making it was a scary, empowering experience. Some of my proudest moments as a lyricist happened while writing Petals for Armor . And I was able to get my hands a little dirtier than usual when it came to instrumentation. I’m in a band with my favourite musicians so I never really feel the need to step into a role as a player when it comes to Paramore records.
“This project, however, benefited from a little bit of musical naïveté and rawness and so I experimented quite a bit more. I made this with some of the closest people to me. Their respective talents really shine bright throughout the record. I like to think we all make each other better and the result is something that sounds and feels exactly as I’d hoped it would. Now that it’s time to put it all out there, I can finally exhale. I’m excited to let people in to experience a different side of myself that I’ve only very recently become familiar with.”
