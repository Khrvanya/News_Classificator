The Nifty has entered in a narrow sideways trading band with a negative bias after making a new all-time high in November. It formed a bearish dark cloud cover pattern the previous week, suggesting that the bears have started creating shorts as the Index approaches stiff resistance zone of 12,100-12,200.
On the downside, however, bulls are protecting the cluster of recent lows placed between 11,800 and 11,880, but a breakdown from this cluster of supports can lead to further selling pressure dragging the index lower to 11,680-11,590.
On the flip side, if the index continues to take support at 11,880-11,800, a short-covering rally may take the index back towards 12,100-12,200.
