On the radar:Â  the sugar market is struggling to hold its footing going into october option expiration. however, we have a feeling that will
The sugar market is starting to look cheap. We have seen it trade much lower, of course, but it rarely holds under 12 cents for long. Further, we have noticed the RSI is below 30 which, in the past, has triggered large short-covering rallies. Those of you following the COT report (Commitments of Traders) issued by the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) are likely aware that sugar futures speculators are holding a historically large net short position; this generally translates into a trend reversal as selling dries up (everyone who wants to be short is already in) and the bears lock in profits.
We like the idea of a long-term and limited-risk play in the sugar market. It is possible to get a foot in the door without losing sleep through the purchase of a March sugar 12.50 call option. The cost is roughly 46 ticks or $515 before transaction costs. This represents the maximum risk of the trade and will occur if the option is held to expiration and the March sugar futures price is below 12.50.
The profit potential is theoretically unlimited but we will be happy if the premium doubles or more. This option was in-the-money in late August and worth nearly double the current value.
This option has 160 days to expiration, that is a substantial amount of time to be in the market with relatively little risk.

Seasonal tendencies are a composite of some of the more consistent commodity futures seasonals that have occurred over the past 15 or more years.
