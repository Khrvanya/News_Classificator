Raw sugar futures on ICE hit 12-1/2-year lows on Monday as oil prices resumed their plunge, renewing worries Brazil might ramp up sugar output instead of ethanol, and as the Brazilian real remained near record lows.
May raw sugar ??fell 0.33 cents, or 3.4%, to 9.40 cents per lb at 1539 GMT, having earlier hit its lowest level since September 2007 at 9.32.
Oil prices slumped again on concerns over scarce storage capacity, especially in the United States, and global economic doldrums caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Falling energy prices tend to prompt cane mills in Brazil to ramp up sugar output at the expense of ethanol, a cane based biofuel.
"There appears to be no respite for the sugar market at the moment," said a dealer. He noted a drop in global consumption due to coronavirus lockdowns seems inevitable, Brazilian sugar output is rising and there seems little hope the real will recover given the political turmoil.

The Brazilian real remained near record lows, making dollar-denominated sugar export deals more attractive to Brazilian mills by raising returns in local currency terms.

The weakening Brazilian currency is also weighing on coffee, driving exports of the dollar-priced commodity.
