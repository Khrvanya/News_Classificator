TYPE 2 diabetes complications arise when rising blood sugar and insulin levels are not brought under control. This can create all manner of problems. Luckily, a herbal tea has been shown to address both.
Type 2 diabetes does not intrude on your daily life in the beginning. In fact, it is so discreet, most people do not know they have it. The condition only shows its ugly side when rising blood sugar levels - caused by a dysfunction in the way the pancreas produces insulin - start to damage blood vessels in your body. The worst case scenario is that this internal rupturing leads to heart disease .
In addition to the threat posed by high blood sugar levels, having too much insulin in your body - a problem that is caused by insulin resistance - can also lead to heart disease.
The only way to stop this harmful process is to stabilise blood sugar and insulin levels through healthy lifestyle changes.
Fortunately, diet offers a surefire way to achieve this goal.
A wealth of research has found certain dietary components essential for managing blood sugar and insulin levels.
