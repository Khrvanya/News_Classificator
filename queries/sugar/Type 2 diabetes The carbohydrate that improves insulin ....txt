Research shows that inositol can be used to produce molecules that are involved in insulin’s action in your cells.
This lead researchers to investigate whether inositol could improve the body’s sensitivity to insulin — thus, reducing insulin resistance.
Several studies have borne out this hypothesis.
One six-month study in 80 postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that can lead to heart disease) found that four grams per day of inositol improved insulin sensitivity, blood pressure and cholesterol levels more than a placebo.

Blood pressure and cholesterol, a waxy substance found in your blood are independent markers for heart disease.
Other research in women with gestational diabetes has also shown benefits of inositol for insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.
Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth.
It is worth nothing that not all carbs are conducive to blood sugar control.

In fact, certain carbohydrates, including those found in starchy items such as white bread, can send blood sugar levels soaring.
Certain carbohydrates are broken down into blood sugar relatively quickly and therefore has a more pronounced effect on blood sugar levels than either fat or protein.
To separate friendly carbs from their harmful counterparts, follow the glycemic Index (GI) - a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels.
Type 2 diabetes - do I have it?
Many people have type 2 diabetes without realising - this is because symptoms do not necessarily make you feel unwell.
