The sale of sugar has declined significantly as bulk consumption has stopped after the imposition of lockdown in the wake of Covid-19.
Sugar wholesalers are in a quandary as except for sale for domestic consumption, there are no buyers for it for over one and a half months now.
Wholesalers said the sale had halved after bulk orders stopped overnight from confectioners, wedding functions, hotel industry, beverage makers, tea vendors, bakers and ice-cream makers, among others. Subsequently, its rate has also nosedived.
Chandarshekhar Mittal, a sugar wholesaler in Bathinda, said, “On an average, we used to sell more than 50 quintals daily but the lockdown has triggered a steep fall in the sales. Now, only 15 to 20 quintiles of sugar is sold daily.”
As the sale declined, stocks have piled up in sugar mills. NK Sighal, deputy general manager of AB Sugars Ltd in Dasuya, said, “Even after curtailing production volumes, sugar stocks have been piling up in godowns. Human consumption is a minuscule part of the consumption and with no bulk orders, sustaining the business will be a Herculean task now. The wholesale rate per quintal of sugar has declined from Rs3,300 to Rs3,160.”
