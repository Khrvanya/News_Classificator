As we enter the third week of the year, the Richmond restaurant scene is hopping – and ever transient. First up, news that Acacia mid-town is closing its doors at the end of the month . The RTD’s Karri Peifer says the restaurant will finish up the month and then a “new venture” will be announced – at a separate location. Meanwhile, the current building has been sold. Much more to come on this front for sure.
Elsewhere on the restaurant closing front, the rumor that Aloi in Scott’s Addition may be closing its digs became reality with the restaurant announcing the impending closure, also at the end of January, on its social channels.
Finally, as you know by now, Comfort is closing at the end of the month. If you enjoyed, as I did, their summer sandwich popup known as The Paulie, you’ll be happy to know it’s making one more return before the restaurant closes down.
In what may already be the most Richmond story of 2020, there’s plenty of drama at Sugar Shack Donuts this week. Earlier this week, a “now leasing” sign appeared perched atop the donut chain’s flagship location on Lombardy Street – with sources saying only that the shop’s lease was up in July. Then came a viral posting from an alleged former employee who claimed 40 employees were laid off and the owner, Ian Kelley, was facing allegations of sexual assault. We haven’t been able to independently verify the claims made in the viral Facebook post, which you can read for yourself here , but things look less than rosy for Sugar Shack right now.
On the openings front, The Angry Mussels, which takes over the former Kitchen on Cary space at 1331 E. Cary Street in Shockoe Slip, is now open and serving up authentic Italian cuisine, including a few menu samples such as linguini with clam sauce, Italian sausage and broccoli, steak saltimbocca, and other traditional dishes.
