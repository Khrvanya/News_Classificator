PONDA: Former PWD Minister and Marcaim MLA Sudin Dhavalikar on Thursday urged the government to revive Sanjivani sugar factory through the Central Government Scheme which has a provision of funding Rs 60 crore.
Addressing media persons, the MLA said he had discussed the issue with then Chief Minister late Manohar Parrikar in 2018 in presence of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari , the then Agriculture Minister Vijai Sardesai to bring it under Agricultural Department so that it can get benefits from the Central Government scheme.
“Under this scheme, Sanjivani can get Rs 60 crore for revival and thus factory can be opened to farmers and they should be encouraged to increase their sugarcane production”, he said.
Accusing the Co-operation Minister of being inactive, he called upon the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister to look into matter.
“The Co-operation Minister has failed to  look into demands of farmers. The farmers have not even received the support price and the bills have not been cleared towards sugarcane supply. For inability of Co-operation Minister, finally the people will blame the Chief Minister,” he added.
Sudin blamed Gaude for failing to carry out development in Priol constituency and for promising to develop Marcaim Hospital.
The MLA said the recently completed projects in Priol were launched by him and his brother Deepak. He said the Banastarim market complex, bus  stand complex, water storage tank and pipeline laying works were introduced by MGP in Priol.
