LONDON — Raw sugar futures on ICE rose on Tuesday, extending the previous session’s gain as oil prices firmed on hopes of supply cuts and signs that the spread of the coronavirus might be starting to slow. Cocoa and coffee prices also moved higher.
Stronger energy prices can tempt Brazilian cane mills to produce less sugar and more ethanol, a cane-based biofuel. However, with oil values having plunged this year, the South American country is expected to ramp up sugar output.
* May raw sugar was up 0.07 cents, or 0.8%, at 10.53 cents per lb by 1508 GMT. The front month had fallen to a 1-1/2 year low of 10.02 cents last Wednesday.
* “The translation of higher oil prices into support for sugar is not automatic; there are great many ‘moving parts’ in this chain. And Brazil’s mills are still better off producing sugar than competing with local-currency ethanol,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note.
* Brazilian sugar mills had hedged 17 million tonnes of sugar sales using New York’s ICE futures in the crop year to March 31 versus 11 million tonnes over the same period the previous year, Archer Consulting said.
* The research firm said that, despite recent price falls, more forward sales could come from Brazil because of the local currency’s record falls against the dollar and companies switching from producing ethanol to sugar.
* French sugar beet planting for the 2020 harvest was seen falling 5.2% from last year to 423,000 hectares.
* May white sugar rose $1.50, or 0.5%, to $331.60 a tonne.
* July London cocoa rose 1 pound, or 0.1%, to 1,831 pounds a tonne.
* Cocoa arrivals at ports in top grower Ivory Coast reached 1.677 million tonnes between Oct. 1 and April 5, exporters estimated, down 2.8% from the same period last season.
* More moisture will still be needed to strengthen Ivory Coast’s mid-crop after above-average rains in most cocoa regions last week.
* July New York cocoa was up $33, or 1.4%, at $2,381 a tonne.
* May arabica coffee rose 2.6 cents, or 2.3%, to $1.1925 per lb.
* Rabobank expects Brazil to produce 67.5 million 60 kg bags of coffee in 2020/21, leading to a global surplus of 5.6 million bags during the season.
* A dealer said the global market will swing into deficit in 2021/22 and that there should be lots of support for prices between $1.0300-$1.1500 per lb given current tightness, with ICE-certified stocks set to continue falling .
* Luckin Coffee’s chairman and chief executive have handed over shares in the Chinese coffee chain to lenders. Luckin, a major rival to Starbucks in China, last week said that much of its 2019 sales were fabricated.
* July robusta coffee rose $3, or 0.3%, to $1,224 a tonne. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky and David Goodman)
