Even in today's health-conscious world, sugar-soaked cereal remains a morning staple for many US kids, who are blissfully unaware of how much sugar lurks in every spoonful.
But on this National Cereal Day, we're poking through the nostalgia to rank beloved cereals from least to most sugary.
To evaluate the amount of sugar, we followed criteria outlined by the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), a service of the US Department of Agriculture that reimburses care facilities that give out snacks.
According to the CACFP, facilities cannot serve breakfast cereals that contain more than 21.2 grams of sugar per 100 grams of dry cereal. That value is calculated by dividing the cereal's grams of sugar per serving by the serving size in grams.
If the answer is 0.21 or less, the cereal is below the sugar limit. Anything higher is considered unhealthy.
Each cereal was evaluated dry, by its original flavor, based on the nutritional information available on each cereal brand's website. We're sorry in advance for the crushing disappointment.
