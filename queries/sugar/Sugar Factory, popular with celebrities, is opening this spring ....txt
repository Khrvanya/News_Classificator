Sugar Factory American Brasserie, which Food & Wine has called “the most Instagrammed restaurant in the United States," is opening a location this spring in Dover.
The chain based in Las Vegas is the latest eatery being added to Dover Downs Hotel & Casino. The more than 5,000-square-foot restaurant and confectionary shop will replace the current Garden Café and Gazebo Bar.
Dover Downs is owned by Twin River Worldwide Holdings, which also runs two casinos in Rhode Island and one in Mississippi as well as a Colorado horse racetrack.
The Sugar Factory's retail shop has signature items such as Couture Pops. The lollipops, which can cost around $26, are candy as well as an accessory. Customers can choose fake jewel encrusted handles and then can mix and match lollipop flavors.
The restaurant side offers "insane" milkshakes garnished with slices of cheesecake, Twinkies and rainbow rock candy. Sugar Factory also has 60-ounce drinks, known as goblets.
The food menu is equally over-the-top with mini sliders served on rainbow-colored buns. Monster burgers come with toppings such as white chocolate shavings and macaroni and cheese.
Sugar Factory sites have been popular with celebrities, including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Pitbull, Drake and Jennifer Lopez, who are often photographed with the outrageous foods and drinks.
George Papanier, president and chief executive officer of Twin River Worldwide Holdings, said the popularity of the restaurants was one of the main reasons why they decided to open a location in Dover.
“We have partnered with Sugar Factory in the past at another one of our properties in Mississippi and have seen great results there," Papanier said in a prepared statement.
Other U.S. locations include New York, Atlanta, San Diego, Atlantic City, Pentagon City, Washington D.C. Orlando and South Beach Miami. There also are sites in Manila, Philippines and The Mall World Trade Center in Abu Dhabi.
