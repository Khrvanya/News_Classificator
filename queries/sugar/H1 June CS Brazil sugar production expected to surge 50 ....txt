Santos — Sugar production in the first half of June in Brazil's key Center-South region is expected to total 2.814 million mt, a spike of 50% year on year, according to the consensus expectations of analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts June 22.
If analyst estimates prove to be right, the region will deliver the highest volume of sugar produced in any first 15 days of June on record and up 17.74% from the previous record of 2.390 million mt reached for the 2017-18 crop.
Brazilian sugar production has been breaking records since the beginning of the 2020-21 Center-South crop on April 1, as the international price in the local Real currency has been remunerating better than ethanol in the domestic market.
The amount of sugarcane crushed in the first half of June is expected to total 42.45 million mt, similar to the 42.55 million mt crushed in the prior year period, according to the survey consensus. If this forecast proves to be right, the cumulative cane crush of the 2020-21 crop will be up to 144.86 million mt.
Of the 10 analysts surveyed, the range of H1 June total cane crush forecasts was between 40.7 million mt and 44 million mt.
Industry association UNICA is expected to release its official production figures in the coming days.
The analysts surveyed by Platts expected an average of nearly one day lost to rain in the analyzed period, which is within the normal weather conditions for this period of the year.
The cane's total recoverable sugar (ATR) was expected to rise to 136.1 kg/mt from 129.23 kg/mt in H1 June 2019. The higher ATR also reflects drier weather in CS Brazil since the beginning of the crop.
While drier weather has favored a fast crush pace and sugar production in the current crop, some analysts suggest these conditions might cut the total volume of cane to be crushed in the 2021-22 crop by nearly 15 million mt, compared with the 600 million mt estimate for the current crop.
The proportion of cane used for sugar production in CS Brazil in H1 June was expected to surge to 47.89% from 35.69% a year earlier, according to the survey. The larger share of cane being converted for sugar production is due to higher export sugar prices and capped ethanol consumption in the domestic market.
Platts assessed hydrous ethanol converted in raw sugar equivalent at 9.89 cents/lb June 22, while the ICE NY11 sugar futures market settled at 11.92 cents/lb, pointing to an export premium of 2.03 cents/lb or $44.75/mt to domestic hydrous ethanol. With the recent depreciation of the Real, Brazilian producers would receive a premium of roughly Real 235/mt compared with the spot market to export sugar.
As the ethanol mix was expected to fall dramatically to 52.11% from 64.31% in the year-ago period, and the volume of cane crushed was mostly unchanged on the year, the total volume of cane ethanol produced is expected to fall 13.9% on the year to 1.79 billion liters.
Production of hydrous ethanol, which is used as standalone E100 biofuel in Brazil, was expected to have fallen 12.5% year on year to 1.19 billion liters in H1 June, while anhydrous ethanol output in the period was expected to reach 596 million liters, a steeper cut of 16.6%. Anhydrous is used at a mandatory blending rate of 27% in the Brazilian gasoline.
