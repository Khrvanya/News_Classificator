Want to curb your sugar cravings? Start the day with one of these breakfast recipes
Make the transition from holiday sugar binge to healthy eating mode easier (and more delicious) with this chia seed pudding and homemade coconut cereal.
Welcome back from the cookie-cocktail-candy binge . It was fun while it lasted, but most of us are likely feeling the effects — whether you're sluggish, bloated or carrying a few extra pounds around the middle.
So it's time to bounce back . And we think breakfast is a great (and manageable) place to start.
“Coming off the holidays it’s normal to crave a lot of sugar , so I created both of these breakfast options as an alternative," says Kelly LeVeque, holistic nutritionist and celebrity health coach. "They’re both high in fiber, protein and healthy fat, and low in sugar and net carbohydrates to support blood sugar balance, regulate hunger hormones and fuel our body for the new year. If you grew up on cereal, yogurt or granola these are the perfect swaps."
LeVeque shares the two recipes from her new book, " Body Love Every Day: Choose Your Life-Changing 21-Day Path to Food Freedom ," to help get your new year started on the right foot.
