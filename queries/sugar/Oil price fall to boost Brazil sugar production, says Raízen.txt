Oil price fall to boost Brazil sugar production, says Raízen
SAO PAULO, March 9 (Reuters) - The sharp fall in global oil prices should result in higher sugar production in Brazil in the new crop that starts in April, Ricardo Mussa, the incoming chief executive officer of the world’s largest sugar producing company Raízen, said on Monday.
“There was already the intention to raise sugar production this year, and oil’s price fall boosts that plan,” Mussa told reporters after a presentation to investors and analysts. Raízen is a 50-50 venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Cosan SA. (Reporting by Nayara Figueiredo, writing by Marcelo Teixeira in New York Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
