The Fed put kicks in.
The Federal Reserve has gotten into the corporate bond game.
Earlier in 2020, the Fed took an unprecedented path into corporate bond investing via ETFs (exchange-traded funds). This move, along with other stimulus measures, stopped the bear market in stocks (and corporate debt) in its tracks. Similarly, the Fed announced today it would be venturing into individual corporate bonds. Not only are these moves market stabilizing in that they mitigate overzealous/panicked selling they also promote investor confidence in the system.
Many argue the moves the Fed makes today is simply building a house of cards in and the piper will eventually need to be paid, but I recall hearing those arguments in 2008 and 2009 as well. So these schemes can be successful for quite some time, even if the flaws do eventually come to light it could be decades down the road.
The quip, "don't fight the Fed" comes to mind. The Fed has made it clear they are willing to use tools beyond conventional monetary policy to keep the markets and the economy afloat in the midst of the largest threat to stability in our lifetimes. Whether you agree with the Fed's actions or not, the die is cast.
Treasuries give up overnight gains.
The US Treasury futures market caught a bid overnight as coronavirus concerns and soft data out of China sparked selling in the stock indices. However, in light of the pace and breadth of stock market selling seen since late last week, the bond and note bulls had to be disappointed in the modest gains. Further, the fact that Treasuries held trendline resistance and closed slightly negative for the session is telling.
Any gains in Treasuries from here will be hard-fought and will likely require help from negative headlines and panicked trading in stocks. We doubt the bond bulls will get what they want. Instead, it feels like Treasuries are trying to put in a long-term top. Of course, we live in an uncertain world so any bearish positions should be hedged or protected from the unforeseen.
We've been looking for a re-pricing in Treasuries, but time is running out on that idea. Seasonal strength is due at the end of the month.
Will the economy see a V-shaped recovery?
According to Larry Kudlow, the Trump admin is expecting a V-shaped recovery. Despite the stock market's success at such, this would be a tall order for an economy in which the middle class has been gutted. Nevertheless, we are seeing signs of consumer willingness to jump back in the saddle far before most had expected them to.
Here in Las Vegas, which probably isn't an accurate barometer for the country, we are seeing the Strip, local casinos, and small businesses spring back to life (with social distancing measures in place). It will take some time, but knowing markets are forward-looking and the government has injected cash into the economy that will be looking for a home, it is hard to side with the bears as cities across the nation are flipping the "on" switch.
Ironically, we are seeing and hearing of some Robinhood app type of traders using their government stimulus checks to buy stocks!!
