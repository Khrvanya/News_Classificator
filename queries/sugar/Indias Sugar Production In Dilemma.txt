While most of domestic organisation are asking farmers for avoiding sugary sowing international markets are hoping to get better sugar out puts by India.Tkhanks to better future prospects for monsoon season. This year India's sugar production may well be estimated as second in World.
India’s production is forecast to rebound 17 percent to 33.7 million tons as above average water  reservoir levels are expected to boost yieldsand to incentivize growers to harvest additional  acreage. Consumption is forecast at a record due to a growing economy. Exports are forecast unchanged at 5.0 million tons.
While consistent push to abstain from sowing,  farmer union representative for instance Pushpendra Singh president of Kisan Shakti Sangh believes that policy makers may not be able to make it for payment issues to small farmers.
Stocks are up more than double minimum stock requirements of around 3 month’s consumption. This will be a challenging position for government thay is already fighting with post lockdown situation and how agriculture sector can become a saviour of Indians economy.
