In an era that is waging war on sugar, a range of companies have started to experiment with sugar alternatives. Jaclyn Bowen explores.
Sugar consumption in the United States has been on the rise in the past decade. Between 2018 and 2019, Americans consumed about 11 million metric tons of sugar, up from roughly 10 million metric tons in 2010.1 According to the University of California San Francisco,2 the average American consumes 66 pounds of added sugar each year.
Meanwhile, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)3 is trying to curb the domestic addiction.

To live healthier, longer lives, the CDC says that Americans need to be more active and ‘eat better’, which includes consuming fewer calories from added sugars.
