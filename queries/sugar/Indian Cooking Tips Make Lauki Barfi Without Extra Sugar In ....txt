Remember to use ripe but not overripe lauki. Peel lauki, scoop out the flesh, grate lauki and squeeze out excess water. Cook with full cream milk, condensed milk and ghee for some time. Condensed milk is naturally sweet so there's no need to add sugar. But, if you like your mithai a little sweeter, you can add sugar at this point to the lauki barfi.
That's it. Sprinkle some dry fruits and let the mixture cool down to room temperature. Then refrigerate it so that the barfi is set completely. Cut it in square shaped-pieces or of any desired shape and you'll have your healthful and lauki ki barfi ready in minutes .
