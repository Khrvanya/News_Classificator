As Rakul Preet mentions, you need not curb your craving for cake as long as you can make sure it is healthy. To help you do that here is a recipe for vegan, gluten-free pumpkin chocolate cake, courtesy Green Smoothie Gourmet by food blogger Dee Dine. Try this:
* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Dust with cocoa powder, and shake out the excess. Keep them aside.
* Mix almond milk and apple cider vinegar in a cup and let it rest for a few minutes.
* Mix all the ingredients in the large bowl. Stir until combined.
* In the small bowl, mix up all the dry ingredients.
* Alternately add the apple cider vinegar mixture and the dry ingredients from the small bowl into the large bowl with all the wet ingredients. Keep mixing the ingredients well as you keep adding.
* Divide the batter between your cake pans.
* Bake for about 35 minutes or until the cake is ready. Cool for 30 minutes before removing from the pan.
* Frost carefully as the layers will have crumbly surfaces.
