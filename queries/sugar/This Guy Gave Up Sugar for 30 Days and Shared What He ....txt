Barron was up for the challenge, though he begins with a caveat: He’d already enjoyed a pretty low-sugar diet, so going cold turkey for a month wasn’t as hard for him as it might be for others. “This felt like taking a test that I knew I was overly prepared for,” he says. He also didn’t see any radical changes in his body, which was already pretty fit.
That said, he does want to offer some tips. Dodging sugar was “super-annoying”—see the comparison to walking through a rainstorm—and took a lot of planning. He learned to find sugar hiding other under names, such as government-subsidized “high fructose corn syrup.” He also found that thanks to something called “palate fatigue,” he ended up eating less; without the flavor diversity he got from sweetness, he felt full faster.
Barron learned a lot from his experience, and his insights go deeper than, say, simply pointing out that kicking sugar left him shredded. Check out the full video below to see what else he learned.
