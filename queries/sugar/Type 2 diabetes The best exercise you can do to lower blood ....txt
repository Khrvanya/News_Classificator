The charity Diabetes UK outlines the benefits of walking, as well as their One Million Step Challenge.
Diabetes UK correctly states that "you can walk anywhere, any time and it's free".
The benefits of walking, alongside lowering blood sugar levels, is that it helps people to "build stamina, burn excess calories, and makes your heart healthier".
Moreover, walking is easy on the joints and is suitable for all fitness levels.

The One Million Step Challenge is broken down into 10,000 steps a day for three months – whether that be walking, jogging, or dancing.
Diabetes UK will support your challenge by sending out a welcome pack, emails with "great ideas and mini challenges to keep you on track".
And you get to join the "huge online community of steppers", who are helping to raise money by taking on the challenge.
No minimum sponsorship is required, but the charity suggests a target of £120 – to find out more click here.
Type 2 diabetes: High blood sugar levels will result in more frequent bathroom trips (Image: Getty)
In addition to walking to bring down blood sugar levels, bring a bottle of water with you to sip on.
When blood sugar levels are running high, bathroom trips would have been more frequent, which means your body would need more fluids to rehydrate itself.
Be aware that water intoxication is a thing, which happens when consuming large volumes of water in a short amount of time.
This is why it's safe to sip on water while taking a stroll, and not guzzling down litres of water when feeling dehydrated.
