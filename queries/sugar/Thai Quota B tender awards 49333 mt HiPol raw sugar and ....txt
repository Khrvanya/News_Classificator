Singapore — The third Thai Quota B tender for the 2019/2020 season (October-September) for 25,333 mt of HiPol raw sugar and 12,000 mt of J-Spec for March 1 to May 15 shipment was awarded Wednesday at premiums of 87 points and 81 points, respectively, to March New York No. 11 futures.
Another 24,000 mt of HiPol raw sugar and 12,000 mt of J-Spec for May 1 to July 15 shipment were awarded at premiums of 87 points and 81 points, respectively.
All positions were awarded to Wilmar.
The Quota B tender, which covers 400,000 mt of raw sugar contracts for the season, is issued by several trading houses and sold on behalf of the Thai Cane and Sugar Corp, which has overall responsibility for pricing and selling raw sugar under this quota.
Half of the amount is allocated to international sugar brokers and the other half to local millers for export.
With the tender results indicating support for Thai raw sugar values, trade sources said that was largely due to the expectation of a tighter Thai sugar crop in the 2019/2020 marketing season.
Dry weather conditions and reduced cane acreage in Thailand were two main factors cited for the reduction in sugar production.
Thai sugar cane production for 2019/2020 has been estimated at 107 million-110 million mt, down 17% year on year.
S&P Global Platts assessed Thai HiPol cargoes for loading between March 1 and May 15 at New York March plus 87 points, up 12 points day on day. May 1 to July 15 loading cargoes climbed 8 points to be assessed at New York May plus 87 points.
