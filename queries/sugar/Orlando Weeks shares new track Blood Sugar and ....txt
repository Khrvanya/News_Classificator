Former frontman for The Maccabees, Orlando Weeks has shared the lead single from his brand new album A Quickening. The new song, ‘Blood Sugar’ is our Track of the Day.
It would be easy to rest on your laurels if you were Orlando Weeks. Having fronted The Maccabees during their rise form indie darlings to mighty mainstreamers, Weeks has very little to prove in music.
But when the birth of his son inspired him the singer couldn’t refuse the challenge of creating his own solo record. Speaking with NME he said of the album, “The whole record is about the anticipation of him and our experience, apart from ‘Milk Breath’, which is obviously about after he was born. But that time was long and short. It went in the blink of an eye but in the moment it felt stretched.”
While Weeks may have debuted some of the album’s material last year while on tour, the LP is now ready for a proper release, arriving in June of this year.
The lead single from the album is ‘Blood Sugar’. Perhaps as a nod to his past with The Maccabees or indeed because he was in need of a lullaby, but ‘Blood Sugar’ is a gorgeous lilting number.
“There’s often a reason why something has become a cliché and I think that’s the case as something as broad an experience as waiting for your firstborn,” said Weeks when referencing the lullabyllic nature of the album.
Listen below to ‘Blood Sugar’ and try not to drift off.
