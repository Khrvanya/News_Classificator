Be advised that all my comments are my OPINION and that OPINION is based on my long term in-house model that I dubbed LAWG 647. The prices I use in my model are week ending prices, usually Friday. BTW, trading commodities is risky and not meant for those that faint at the sight of blood.
Here we are it is already June 2nd and I hope you are all staying safe. Let us look at what happened to those commodities that I wrote about last week and examine the critical values, according to the Model, going into this Friday.
Cattle: According to the Model August Cattle did turn bullish. A close at or below $90.45 is needed this Friday to reverse the trend back to bearish. On Monday (yesterday) August Cattle closed at $98.97.
Dollar Index: According to the Model June Dollar Index did turn bearish. A close at or above 100.02 is needed this Friday to reverse the trend back to bullish. On Monday (yesterday) it closed at $99.60.
Sugar: According to the Model July Sugar did turn bullish. A close at or below $9.56 is needed this Friday to reverse the trend back to bearish. On Monday (yesterday) it closed at $11.00.
Cocoa: According to the Model July Cocoa did turn bullish. A close at or below $2239 is needed this Friday to reverse the trend back to bearish. On Monday (yesterday) it closed at $2493.
