Floyd Mayweather has responded after seeing himself placed behind Sugar Ray Leonard in an all-time welterweight rankings list.
It is unknown where the list originated from, but the discussion was raised by the American in a recent interview, saying it was sent to him by a friend.
Mayweather told FightHype : “It was crazy, someone sent me something about ‘The Best Welterweights’.
“They had Sugar Ray Leonard number one.
“Like I said before, he was the guy that paved the way for myself.
“But how can you have a guy ranked #1 when his first loss was to a lightweight, Roberto Duran?
“And then they also talked about me facing [Juan Manuel] Marquez, which was at catchweight of 144lbs.
“But this same guy, Marquez, knocked out their number three ranked welterweight – because they had Pacquiao number three.
“He got knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez.
“They were trying to say that basically he [Marquez] was too small for me.
“But he wasn’t too small for Pacquiao.
“It’s crazy how all these ratings go nowadays. Of course, fighters are gonna always say, ‘I would’ve done this, I should be ranked here.’
“But a lot of these so-called boxing experts, it’s just crazy how these guys are experts.
