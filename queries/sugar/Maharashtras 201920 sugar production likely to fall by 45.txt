The extent of drop in Maharashtra’s sugar production will play a crucial role in determining the country's total sugar production for the 2019-20 season. In its first estimate for the 2019-20 sugar season, ISMA expects sugar production to be around 268.5 lakh tonnes against the figure of 331.61 lakh tonnes during 2018-19 sugar season.
But despite the reverses, India will still end up with excess closing stock after meeting domestic and export requirements, said industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association.
Pune: India's sugar production for 2019-20 is likely to fall by 19%, hit by drought and then floods, and Maharashtra, the second largest sugar producer in the country, is expected to post the biggest fall of 45%, said the state's sugar commissioner. But despite the reverses, India will still end up with excess closing stock after meeting domestic and export requirements, said industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
In its first estimate for the 2019-20 sugar season, ISMA expects sugar production to be around 268.5 lakh tonnes without considering the impact of sugar reduction due to diversion of B heavy molasses/sugarcane juice to ethanol. Considering the diversion to ethanol, ISMA fears sugar production to further decline to around 260 lakh tonnes.
The extent of drop in Maharashtra’s sugar production will play a crucial role in determining the country's total sugar production for the 2019-20 season.
“After taking into account the impact of floods in the state, we now expect that a total of 518 lakh tonnes of sugarcane to become available for crushing, while the total sugar production of Maharashtra will be 58 lakh tonnes against 107 lakh tonnes produced in the previous year," said Shekhar Gaikwad, sugar commissioner, Maharashtra.
Gaikwad also fears that 36 sugar mills from the state won’t be operational this year due to non-availability of sugarcane.
However, sugar trader Praful Vithlani thinks that Maharashtra's sugar production will touch 63 lakh tonnes as the yields will be higher due to returning monsoon rainfall in some parts of the state. ISMA has pegged Maharashtra's 2019-20 sugar production at 62 lakh tonnes, a decline of 40%.
India’s total sugar production during 2018-19 sugar season was 331.61 lakh tonnes. “Considering the opening balance of 107 lakh tonnes as on October 1, 2018, and sugar and exports of around 38 lakh tonnes and sugar sales of 255 lakh tonnes, the closing balance as on September 30, 2019, is estimated to be 145.81 lakh tonnes," said ISMA in a release.
Against the new Maximum Admissible Export Quantity (MAEQ) of 60 lakh tonnes, several sugar companies have finalised export contracts for export of about 7 - 8 lakh tonnes of sugar, informed ISMA. Sugar exporter Praful Vithlani confirmed that there has been good demand for Indian sugar from the Asian markets. "Most of the export contracts have been signed with Iran from where we have good demand," said Vithlani. Bangladesh and the Middle-East countries are the others which are interested in Indian sugar. The contracts are signed for both raw and white sugar.
