This is the time of year I feel like a kid in the ice cream shop wanting to try all of the innovative newfangled flavors: French toast bacon, lavender coconut with black sesame seeds, Earl Grey tea with shortbread cookies, Black Forest licorice, “everything but the kitchen sink,” and even “Movie Time” — popcorn-flavored ice cream with sea salt caramel swirls and caramel truffles. Some don’t stray from the basic flavors like vanilla, the most popular flavor, chocolate or strawberry.
