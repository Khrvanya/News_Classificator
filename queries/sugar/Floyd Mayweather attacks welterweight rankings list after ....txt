Floyd Mayweather has lashed out at a recently released all-time best welterweights list after being ranked behind Sugar Ray Leonard.
The 43-year-old was fuming with his position in the rankings, claiming that Leonard doesn't deserve the top spot because he lost to Roberto Duran, a lightweight boxer, during his career.
Looking at Mayweather's career, it's easy to understand why he might feel a bit miffed about not coming first. Arguably one of the best to ever grace the ring, Mayweather 'retired' from the sport with an incredible professional career record of 50-0.
Despite his anger, "Money" hasn't actually told anyone where exactly in the rankings list he was placed, but judging from his reaction, he wasn't treated very kindly.
Speaking to FightHype , Mayweather ranted: "It was crazy, someone sent me something about 'The Best Welterweights.'
"They had Sugar Ray Leonard No.1.
"Like I said before, he was the guy that paved the way for myself.
"But how can you have a guy ranked No.1 when his first loss was to a lightweight, Roberto Duran?
"And then they also talked about me facing [Juan Manuel] Marquez, which was at catchweight of 144lbs.
"But this same guy, Marquez, knocked out their No.3 ranked welterweight - because they had Pacquiao No.3. He got knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez."
"They were trying to say that basically he [Marquez] was too small for me. But he wasn't too small for Pacquiao.
Mayweather continued his tirade, explaining: "It's crazy how all these ratings go nowadays. Of course, fighters are always gonna say, 'I would've done this, I should be ranked here.'
"But a lot of these so-called boxing experts, it's just crazy how these guys are experts.
Perhaps it was for the best that Mayweather never lost a fight during his professional career, because if anything, this shows that he really doesn't take losing very well.
If he gets this worked up over a list, imagine how bad it'd be if he lost in a ring.
