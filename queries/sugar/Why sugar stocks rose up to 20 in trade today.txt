The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday raised the procurement price of ethanol derived from 100 per cent sugarcane juice to Rs 59.13 per litre from the current rate of Rs 47.13. The move would help sugar mills quickly release arrears of cane farmers, which stands at over Rs 13,000 crore.
According to market experts, gain in the counter of sugar prices is mainly due to the government approval of hike in the prices of ethanol.
Such increase may result into more sugar production as more mills may start producing ethanol, they added.
The price for ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses (also called as intermediary molasses) was hiked to Rs 52.43 a litre from the current Rs 47.13 but that for ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses was reduced marginally to Rs 43.46 from Rs 43.70. Diverting sugarcane juice for directly making ethanol, which can be doped in petrol, is common across the major sugar producing nations. Brazil tops the list where all the ethanol produced is directly made from sugarcane juice.
The move would help sugar mills quickly release arrears of cane farmers, which stand at over Rs 13,000 crore. As much as 40 per cent of these dues are in Uttar Pradesh alone.
Ethanol so extracted would be doped in petrol to cut reliance on imports. The government is looking at scaling up the blending to 10 per cent in the next couple of years from 4-5 per cent now.
