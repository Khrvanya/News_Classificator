If you are a diabetic who depends on insulin, then you might also be prone to hypoglycemia. It is a condition in which the blood sugar level drops drastically to a dangerous level. Hypoglycemia is mostly related to diabetes but factors like diet, exercise and certain medications also play a major role. Most common symptoms of hypoglycemia are dizziness, headache, confusion, sweating, weakness and trembling. Some people even feel numb and tingling in their body parts. It is necessary to take appropriate action the moment you feel your blood sugar level has dropped. If correct action is not taken at the right time, you may faint, experience seizure or can go even in a coma.
To bring the glucose level back to the natural level, eat or make the person eat at least 15 grams of easily digestible carbohydrates. This may include:
20 minutes after eating some carbohydrates check your blood sugar level. If your sugar level is not going up, then have another 15 grams of carbohydrate. If it is not your mealtime yet, then have some snacks to bring the glucose level back to normal.
To prevent such episodes of low blood glucose level, here are a few things to be careful about:
-Have three meals daily at the same time.
-Try to exercise 30 minutes to 1 hour daily. You can walk, run or go to the gym.
