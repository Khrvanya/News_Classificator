LONDON: Raw sugar futures on ICE fell on Thursday as easing tightness in refined, white sugar supplies overshadowed demand recovery hopes linked to encouraging results from coronavirus vaccine trials.
October raw sugar was down 0.05 cents, or 0.4%, at 12.11 cents per lb at 1515 GMT, after testing but failing to breach resistance at 12.25 cents on Wednesday.
August white sugar fell $6.90, or 1.9%, to $349.40 a tonne, with the discount for August versus October sugar widening, meaning the recent supply tightness has all but disappeared.
Dealers said that, given the situation in the whites market, there was little fundamental reason for raws to gain despite improved sentiment in the wider financial markets.
