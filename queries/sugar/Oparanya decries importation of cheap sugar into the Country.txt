The Chairman of the Council of Governors Wycliffe Oparanya has blamed Cartels for the illegal importation of Sugar in the country.
Oparanya says the illegal importation continues to have negative impact on the local industry.
“Sugar Barons are the cause of Sugar importation crisis, we are introducing a Bill in Parliament through a Private Bill from Hon MP Wafula Wamunyinyi from Kandui and we have met with CS Peter Munya for amendments, the bill is now before the National Assembly and hopeful it will be ready within one month,” He said.
The Kakamega Governor said The Sugar Bill will stipulate the mechanism on sugar importation. Key stake holders including Farmers & Millers, Consumers, County Governments, National Government as well as Institutions will have a say on sugar Importation in a bid to protect farmers.
