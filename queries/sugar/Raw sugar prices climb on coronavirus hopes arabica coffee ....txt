LONDON — Raw sugar futures on ICE rose on Monday, extending Friday’s gains as equities rallied on a slowdown in coronavirus-related deaths and new cases, though concerns remain that Brazil will ramp up sugar output.
* May raw sugar was up 0.04 cents, or 0.4%, to 10.34 cents per lb at 1420 GMT. The front month had fallen to a 1-1/2 year low of 10.02 cents on Wednesday.
* Equities jumped on coronavirus containment hopes, though a delay in talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut oil supply sent crude prices tumbling again.
* Weak energy prices can tempt Brazilian cane mills to produce more sugar at the expense of ethanol, a cane based biofuel.
* “We now expect Brazilian factories all to make maximum sugar (and) we suspect sugar consumption will have declined due to the virus. Sugar is back to being in serious surplus,” said Marex Spectron in a note.
* Speculators boosted their net short position in ICE raw sugar futures in the week to March 31 by 8,034 contracts to 17,929 contracts, CFTC data showed.
* Still, dealers said the market may be trying to find a bottom near term, with the rate of selling petering out since the 1-1/2 year lows hit last week.
* Indian mills have contracted to export 3.75 million tonnes of sugar since Oct 1, and have shipped out 2.86 million tonnes so far, a leading trade body said.
* Egypt has enough sugar reserves for 8.6 months, with state buyer ESIIC in the market for 100,000 tonnes of Brazilian raw sugar.
* May white sugar fell $4.40, or 1.3%, to $332.10 a tonne.
* Oman has agreed contracts to purchase 10,000 tonnes of white sugar.

* Rabobank said while the coronavirus might yet prompt labor shortages in Brazil, it is assuming a normal harvest in the world’s top coffee producer as the country is not implementing strict lockdown measures.
* It expects Brazil to produce 67.5 million 60 kg bags in 2020/21, leading to a global surplus of 5.6 million bags during the season, with in-home coffee consumption failing to fully offset the loss of out-of-home consumption due to the virus.
* May robusta coffee fell $4, or 0.3%, to $1,216 a tonne.
* July London cocoa rose 25 pounds, or 1.4%, to 1,842 pounds a tonne.
