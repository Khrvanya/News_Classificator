Sugar Is Set for Best Quarter Since 2016, but Outlook Remains Murky
Sugar prices are poised for their best quarter in four years, driven by a recovery in oil markets and supply disruptions in the market for the sweetener. But traders say the rally may not last.
Raw-sugar futures, which trade in New York, have climbed almost 13% since the end of March to about 12 cents a pound Thursday. The surge, which follows a battering that sent the price to its lowest in over 12 years in April, puts the commodity on track for its best quarter since June 2016.
