WASHINGTON — The US Department of Agriculture, in its May 12 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, forecast 2019-20 US sugar ending stocks at 1,273,000 short tons, raw value, down 161,000 tons, or 11%, from 1,434,000 tons in April due to a slight decline in US beet sugar production and a sharp drop in imports from Mexico. Deliveries were unchanged from April.
The 2019-20 ending stocks-to-use ratio was forecast at 10.4%, down from 11.7% in April, down from 14.5% in 2018-19 and below the minimum USDA target of 13.5% as defined in the suspension agreements with Mexico. Ending stocks would need to increase 383,000 tons to bring the stocks-to-use ratio up to 13.5%, based on the May WASDE data.
US sugar production was forecast at 8,024,000 tons, down 13,000 tons from April due to a like decrease in beet sugar production, forecast at 4,285,000 tons. Cane sugar production was unchanged at 3,740,000 tons with the cane harvest completed in all states but Florida.
Total imports were forecast at 3,731,000 tons, down 149,000 tons, or 3.8%, from April, due to a like decline in imports from Mexico, forecast at 1,050,000 tons, which was reduced due to lower production in Mexico.
