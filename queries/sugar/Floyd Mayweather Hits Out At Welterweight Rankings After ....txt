'Money' has now taken issue with a welterweight rankings list that placed Leonard ahead of him, saying he doesn't deserve it after losing to Roberto Duran.
Mayweather, who claimed a friend sent the list to him, did say that fierce rival Manny Pacquiao finished No 3.
He told FightHype : "It was crazy, someone sent me something about 'The Best Welterweights.'
"They had Sugar Ray Leonard No 1. Like I said before, he was the guy that paved the way for myself. But how can you have a guy ranked No 1 when his first loss was to a lightweight, Roberto Duran?
"And then they also talked about me facing [Juan Manuel] Marquez, which was at catchweight of 144lbs.
"But this same guy, Marquez, knocked out their No 3 ranked welterweight -- because they had Pacquiao No 3.
"He got knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez. They were trying to say that basically he [Marquez] was too small for me."
Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao in a blockbuster clash in 2015 and secured a unanimous decision victory in Las Vegas.
Mayweather explained: "But he [Marquez] wasn't too small for Pacquiao.
"It's crazy how all these ratings go nowadays. Of course, fighters are gonna always say, 'I would've done this, I should be ranked here.'
"But a lot of these so-called boxing experts, it's just crazy how these guys are experts.
