The most common disaccharide is sucrose , which is also known as table sugar and made up of a glucose and fructose molecule. Meanwhile, lactose is found in milk and made up of a glucose and galactose molecule, and maltose is made up of two glucose molecules.
Sugar refers to the sweet-tasting carbs that your body uses for energy. They’re made up of single or paired molecules known as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, and maltose), respectively.
Sugar alcohols, also called polyols, are a type of carbohydrate whose structure resembles both sugars and alcohol.
Still, sugar alcohols do not contain ethanol, and they’re thus safe for people who prefer to avoid alcohol.
Given that they’re similar to sugar, they can activate the sweet receptors on your tongue and have a pleasing, cooling effect on the taste of foods (
However, they’re not as efficiently absorbed or digested as regular sugar and therefore contain fewer calories.
They’re found naturally in some fruits and vegetables, such as plums, strawberries, and avocado, and also made by processing regular sugars.
Sugar alcohols are often used as lower calorie sweeteners in sugar-free chewing gum and candies, as food additives in processed foods, and in toothpaste, certain medications, and laxatives.
Common types of sugar alcohols include xylitol , erythritol, sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, isomalt, and lactitol (
Sugar alcohols have a structure similar to that of sugars but also contain an alcohol molecule. This means they taste sweet but are not absorbed and metabolized in the same way as sugar.
Sugar and sugar alcohols differ significantly in sweetness, calorie content, and digestion, as well as their effect on blood sugar levels and oral health.
Sugar alcohols contain fewer calories than regular sugars.
On average, they supply about 2 calories per gram, compared with the 4 calories per gram supplied by sugars (
