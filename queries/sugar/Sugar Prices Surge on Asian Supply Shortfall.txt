A brewing shortfall of sugar supply in Asia is lifting the global price of the sweetener, providing relief for farmers and refiners after an extended market slump.
Raw-sugar futures rose 1.13% to 14.32 cents a pound in New York on Tuesday, extending their advance in 2020 to 6.7%. Sugar prices have outstripped other soft-commodity markets so far this year, and have recovered 33% since falling to a trough of 10.76 cents a pound in September.
