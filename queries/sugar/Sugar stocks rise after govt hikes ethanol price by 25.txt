CCEA, in a press release, said the decision will serve multiple purposes of reducing excess sugar in the country, increasing liquidity with the sugar mills for settling cane farmer’s dues and making higher ethanol available for Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme.
Market participants said the government’s move is an effort to incentivise ethanol production by sugar mills at a time when petrol and diesel prices in India have reached record levels. Further, market participants said this could push many companies to divert sugar business to ethanol.
The price of Brent crude has risen by 12% since August 15. “Sugar manufacturers who are only otherwise dependent on the sugar produce can diversify more output towards ethanol because they will get more realisation for ethanol and as soon as that happens the sugar produces profitability increases,” said an analyst requesting anonymity.
