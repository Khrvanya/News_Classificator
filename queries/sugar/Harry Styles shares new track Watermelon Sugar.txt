After doing double duty on Saturday Night Live this weekend, Harry Styles - who both hosted and performed on the late night comedy show - gave brand new track ‘Watermelon Sugar’ its debut.
Having previously tweeted how “Kiwi walked so Watermelon Sugar could run”, the sizzling song sees Harry yearning for summer evenings and is our latest exciting glimpse into his forthcoming sophomore album ‘Fine Line’, due out on 13th December.
The new song follows ‘Lights Up’ and the announcement of a huge world tour that’ll see him wowing crowds across North America and Europe next year.
