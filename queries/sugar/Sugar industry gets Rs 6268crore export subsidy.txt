The subsidy will be transferred directly to the farmers’ accounts on behalf of the mills against cane price dues.
Last year too, the government gave export subsidy for exporting at least 5 million tonnes of sugar.
The government on Wednesday announced a Rs 6,268-crore subsidy for export of 6 million tonnes (mt) of sugar for 2019-20 marketing year, starting in October, to help cash-strapped mills liquidate surplus and clear sugarcane arrears to farmers.
The subsidy will be transferred directly to the farmers’ accounts on behalf of the mills against cane price dues. This will benefit farmers of Uttar Pradesh , Karnataka and Maharashtra , the second largest sugarcane producing state where assembly elections are due in two months. Mills will have to provide account details to the government for transferring the money in proportion to the cane bought from farmers.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “A lump sum export subsidy of ?10,448 per tonne will be given to sugar mills in the 2019-20 marketing year (October-September). The money will go directly to the farmers’ accounts,” said Union minister Prakash Javadekar after the meeting.
According to industry executives, cane dues of around ?12,000 crore have yet to be paid to farmers for 2018-19 marketing season, which ends this September.
“Arrears have come down drastically from ?85,546 crore at the start of 2018-19 season due to various interventions by the Centre, including increasing of minimum selling price (MSP) of sugar from ?29 to ?31a kg besides extending soft loans to sugar industry to the extent of ?7,900-10,540 crore and creating ?1,674 crore buffer stock of 4 mt,” said a senior food ministry official, who did not wish to be identified.
The industry welcomed the step, saying it would not only reduce surplus sugar inventory in the next season but also give additional cash flows to the tune of around ?18,000 crore including the subsidy amount.
“This decision will help the mills reduce carrying costs and interest burden as also help them to pay cane price to farmers on time,” said Abinash Verma, director general, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
India’s sugar output is likely to be 32.95 mt in the ongoing 2018-19 marketing year, as against the annual domestic demand of 26 mt.
According to ISMA, the opening stock of sugar is expected to be at an all-time high of around 14.5 mt on October 1, 2019, as against the normative requirement of around 5 mt.
Last year too, the government gave export subsidy for exporting at least 5 million tonnes of sugar. It gave export subsidy of Rs 1,000-3,000 a tonne to sugar mills, depending on their distance from ports. Mills, however, could ship only around 3.5 mt of sugar.
