Sugar production accounts for over half of Eswatinis agricultural output and contributes about US$285m to the country's gross domestic product. The industry employs more than 20,000 workers.
The area planted to sugar cane is forecast to increase by 8% to 70,000 hectares in 2019/20 with forecasts of good rainfall, increased available irrigation water, improvements in cane yields, and growth in the area planted. Sugar production is forecast to increase by 10% to 800,000 tons in 2019/20 based on an increase in sugar cane delivered to the sugar mills, the better quality of sugar cane, and improved sugar mill efficiencies.
There has been a decline in exports to the EU, one of Eswatini's main export markets, due to low sugar prices in the EU and changes in the EU's sugar policies which include the removal of restrictions for domestic sugar beet production and ending preferential access for sugar imports from least developing countries. Cheap imports into the Southern African Customs Union have also affected its exports in the region.
