Sugar Hill has submitted plans for a land disturbance/site development permit in their efforts to proceed with development of the Gold Mine Park. A small temporary easement has been acquired to tie-in with the grading plan along Level Creek Road.
This SPLOST-funded project includes the construction of passive park elements, ways to commemorate the gold mining industry in the Sugar Hill area, a restroom building, and a trailhead for the greenway that runs through the park. The early concept plan, released by the city, shows the greenspace that is preserved as a part of the project.
The city is coordinating with the Sugar Hill Greenway project prior to getting bids on this work.
