So she gave ApoE2 to mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's. And sure enough, Zhao says, the substance not only improved energy production in brain cells but made the cells healthier overall.
"All of this together increased the brain's resilience against Alzheimer's disease," she says.
Another scientist described how mice fed a diet that includes lots of fat and sugar were more likely to develop both diabetes and memory impairment.
The diet caused an increase in dysfunctional brain cells in the mice, says Sami Gabbouj of the Institute of Biomedicine at the University of Eastern Finland. In people, he says, that could "exacerbate" the development of Alzheimer's.
Sleep problems are another common feature of both Alzheimer's and diabetes, says Shannon Macauley , an assistant professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine.
She presented research showing that in mice, the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's do interfere with sleep. But abnormal levels of blood sugar, both high and low, also "lead to disrupted sleep," she says
That's concerning, she says, because poor sleep is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's. So maintaining normal blood sugar levels in Alzheimer's patients could improve their sleep and might even slow down the disease, she says.
All of this research on animals could eventually help people, Washington University's Holtzman says.
"If we can figure out what diabetes is doing to increase risk, maybe that would lead us to new targets, drug targets or treatment targets," he says
