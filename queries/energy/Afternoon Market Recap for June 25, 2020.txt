Afternoon Market Recap for June 30, 2020
Corn jumps 3.5% higher on acreage shocker.
Ben Potter | Jun 30, 2020
Grain markets enjoyed a significant rally Tuesday on the heels of USDA’s highly anticipated quarterly acreage and grain stocks reports, which revealed much lower-than-expected corn and soybean acres. Corn emerged as the day’s big winner, moving more than 3.5% higher. Soybeans carved out gains of nearly 2%, meantime, while most wheat contracts improved between 1% and 2% today.
Parts of the eastern Corn Belt could remain dry from Wednesday through Saturday, although most of the Midwest and Plains will get some measurable precipitation during this time, per the latest 72-hour cumulative precipitation map from NOAA. Further out, the agency’s 8-to-14-day outlook predicts much warmer-than-average weather for the central U.S., with drier conditions emerging in the western Corn Belt and Central Plains between July 7 and July 13.
On Wall St., the Dow tipped 13 points higher in afternoon trading to 25,608 and is set to reap one of the biggest quarterly gains in decades once the markets close later today. Energy futures were mixed – crude oil dropped 1.5% to just above $39 per barrel, while gasoline and diesel each firmed more than 1% this afternoon. The U.S. Dollar softened slightly.
On Monday, commodity funds were net buyers of most grain contracts, including corn (+33,000), soybeans (+2,000), soyoil (+4,000) and CBOT wheat (+11,000) but were net sellers of soymeal (-2,000).
Corn prices saw a major bounce higher today after USDA reported much lower-than-expected acres, which triggered a round of technical buying and short-covering. July futures climbed 11.75 cents to $3.38, with September futures up 12 cents to $3.4075.
Corn basis bids were steady to narrowly mixed Tuesday after rising 2 cents at an Ohio river terminal while easing a penny lower at two Midwestern processors today.
In this morning’s quarterly acreage and grain stocks report from USDA, the agency’s corn acreage estimates came in at 92.006 million planted acres through June 1, although the agency concedes as much as 2.239 million more acres could be planted after that. Analysts expected a much more aggressive total, with an average trade guess of 95.207 million acres. Harvested acres are now anticipated to reach 84.023 million acres – still favorable compared to 2019’s rough result of 81.322 million acres.
USDA reports corn stocks at 5.22 billion bushels, which is 1% above the same time last year. Analysts were expecting a slight decline, with an average trade guess of 4.951 billion bushels. Corn disappearance was significant, dropping 2.73 billion bushels between March and May but couldn’t hold pace with last spring, when disappearance reached 3.41 billion bushels.

Corn quality ratings moved from 72% rated in good-to-excellent condition up to 73% through June 28, which was in line with analyst expectations. Another 22% of the crop is rated fair (down one point from last week), with the remaining 5% rated poor or very poor (unchanged from a week ago). State-by-state quality ranges widely – click here to see how your state is performing so far.
Physiologically, 4% of the crop is now silking, versus 2019’s pace of 2% and the prior five-year average of 7%. Only 11 of the top 18 production states have made measurable progress at this stage, led by southern states, as expected.

South Korea purchased 2.4 million bushels of corn, likely sourced from South Africa or South America, in a private deal last Friday. The grain is for shipment between late August and early September.
Preliminary volume estimates were for 788,021 contracts, jumping ahead of Monday’s final count of 588,552.
Soybean prices jumped nearly 2% higher on supportive USDA acreage and stocks data this morning, holding on for double-digit gains by the close. July futures climbed 16.5 cents to $8.83, with August futures up 17 cents to $8.7850.
Soybean basis bids were mostly steady across the central U.S. Tuesday but did climb 8 cents higher at an Ohio river terminal and stumble 5 cents lower at a Nebraska processor today.
USDA’s latest soybean acreage estimates tumbled below analyst estimates, falling to 83.825 million acres through the end of May, although that is still above USDA’s March estimates of 83.510 million acres. The agency expects another 12.101 million acres to make it in the ground after June 1. Provided trend yields of 49.8 bushels per acre are realized this fall, that acreage would result in a 4.1-billion-bushel soybean harvest.
Soybean stocks tumbled 22% year-over-year to 1.39 billion bushels. That was very close to analyst expectations, with an average trade guess of 1.392 billion bushels. On-farm storage dropped 13% to 633 million bushels, while off-farm storage dropped 28% to 753 million bushels. Soybean disappearance was down 8% from a year ago, losing 869 million bushels between March and May.
Soybean crop ratings improved by a point through June 28, although analysts expected USDA to hold them steady this past week. Now, 71% of the crop is rated in good-to-excellent condition, with 24% rated fair (down a point from last week) and the remaining 5% rated poor or very poor (unchanged from last week).
USDA is no longer reporting planting progress this year for soybeans, noting that 95% of the crop is already emerged. That’s a faster clip than both 2019 (80%) and the prior five-year average (91%). And 14% of the crop is now blooming, versus 5% a week ago. That far exceeds 2019’s pace of 2% and stays moderately ahead of the prior five-year average of 11%.
Preliminary volume estimates were for 306,645 contracts, moving moderately above Monday’s final count of 204,026.
Wheat prices followed other grain prices higher today after USDA released mostly supportive grain stocks and acreage data this morning. July Chicago SRW futures firmed 4.5 cents to $4.90, July Kansas City HRW futures rose 6.75 cents to $4.3550, and July MGEX spring wheat futures climbed 13.5 cents to $5.1050.
All wheat plantings are about 500,000 below trade expectations, with USDA now marking this year’s crop footprint at 44.250 million acres. That number is also below the agency’s March estimates of 44.655 million acres and a final 2019 tally of 45.158 million acres.
Old crop wheat storage is now at 1.04 billion bushels, which is 3% lower compared to a year ago. Analysts expected that number to slip to 980 million bushels, however. Wheat disappearance between March and May reached 372 million bushels, which is 28% lower compared to the same period in 2019.
Spring wheat crop quality took an unexpected tumble lower through June 28. Analysts expected USDA to hold crop ratings steady, at 75% in good-to-excellent condition, but the agency docked the crop six points, sending it to 69% in good-to-excellent condition. Another 25% is rated fair (up four points from a week ago), with the remaining 6% rated poor or very poor (up two points from last week).
Winter wheat quality ratings improved slightly, with 10% rated excellent, 42% rated good, 32% rated fair and the remaining 16% rated poor or very poor. There is a lot of variance among the top production states, from Texas (34% in good-to-excellent condition) all the way up to Montana (87% in good-to-excellent condition).
Harvest pace for winter wheat is moving more slowly than analysts anticipated, with USDA reporting 41% progress through Sunday. That’s right in line with the prior five-year average and well ahead of 2019’s pace of 26%.
India’s government has purchased a record amount of domestic wheat this year, topping 1.426 billion bushels, but some of that grain could be exposed to rot amid a storage shortage. India is expected to produce a bin-busting wheat crop this year, reaching 3.938 billion bushels.
