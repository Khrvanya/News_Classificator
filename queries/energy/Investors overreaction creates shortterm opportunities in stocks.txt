The remarkable recovery of U.S. stocks illustrates how markets tend to overshoot major events. This can set up opportunities for large gains over short periods. It also underlines the need to be careful with statistics.
Here’s a chart showing the movement of the S&P 500 Index SPX,
this year through June 5:
Through Friday, the benchmark index was down only 1% for 2020, despite the coronavirus outbreak, the unprecedented shutdown of major portions of the U.S. economy, and all the fear that led the index to be down 31% for 2020 through March 23.
The well-known hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller said during a CNBC interview Monday that he was “humbled” by the stock market’s recovery, and had missed out on most of it. He said he had underestimated the effect of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to enhance liquidity and the power of investors’ enthusiasm for the reopening of the economy.
Now here’s a chart of continuous contract prices for West Texas crude oil this year through June 5:
WTI is still down 35% this year, but you can see the continuous contract price went from $61.06 at the end of 2018, to as low as $6.50 (intraday) on April 21, to $39.55 Friday.
Mark Grant, the chief global strategist for fixed income at B. Riley FBR, wrote repeatedly in his “Out of the Box” email commentary that this year’s oil doldrums were a “blip” and that the low prices signaled opportunities for long-term investors.
On Monday, Grant wrote: “I continue to think that there are opportunities left in this space as many people and institutions have not fully warmed up to what is underway yet. “
The following table includes the 25 stocks among the S&P 500 that were down at least 60% in the first quarter. They are sorted by those declines, and you can see that all have shot up in the second quarter:
