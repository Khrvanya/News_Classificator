COAL producer Geo Energy Resources on Tuesday said it has engaged legal advisers in response to news reports about a potential dispute over a proposed deal in Indonesia.
Media outlets reported that the current or former ultimate controlling shareholders of Titan Infra Energy (TIE) filed a legal claim in the Jakarta courts against, among others, TIE and its major subsidiaries, Victor Tanuadji, as well as two Geo Energy subsidiaries - Geo Ventures Global (GVG) and Geo Coal International (GCI) - for acting against the interests of TIE shareholders.
The claim is in connection with Geo Energy's proposed US$25 million acquisition of the entire stake in Titan Global Energy from TIE and its affiliate, as well as coal purchase agreements signed between GCI and TIE.
Mr Tanuadji is a TIE director and the son of Handoko Tanuadji, the ultimate controlling shareholder of TIE and its subsidiaries, according to TIE's 2018 audited financial statements dated Dec 23, 2019. Mr Victor Tanuadji is also a guarantor of the coal purchase agreements between GCI and TIE.
The proposed Titan Global Energy deal, announced last September, would have given Geo Energy a majority stake in two South Sumatra coal mines. GVG had entered into a conditional share-purchase agreement with TIE and its affiliate, Jaya Utama Indonesia, for the acquisition.
