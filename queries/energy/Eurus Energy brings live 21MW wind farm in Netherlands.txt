July 1 (Renewables Now) - Japan’s Eurus Energy Group has launched commercial operations at a 21-MW wind farm in the Netherlands.
The renewable energy company announced the milestone for the Windpark Deil project on Wednesday. Located in the municipality of West Betuwe in Gelderland province, the plant is equipped with five Vestas V136-4.2 MW turbines with a hub height of 140 meters and a rotor diameter of 136 metres. Their output, expected to be enough to meet the consumption of more than 26,000 homes, will be sold to Dutch utility Eneco.
Eurus Energy acquired the project in 2018 and contracted Yard Energy to build the power plant.
Following the commissioning of Windpark Deil, Eurus Energy’s wind power capacity in the Netherlands has grown to 148.5 MW, coming from 17 power plants. The Japanese firm said its portfolio in the country will reach 300 MW in 2021 after it brings online three more wind farms that are currently under construction.
Eurus entered the Dutch market in 2016.
