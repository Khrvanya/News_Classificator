A consortium comprising ACWA Power, GIC and AEPC has achieved financial closure for a 500 MW solar PV plant at Ibri in Oman. It is currently the largest solar PV plant in the country.
The plant is an Independent Power Project (IPP) that will be developed on a build, own, operate basis. Located around 300km west of Muscat, the Ibri-2 IPP will contribute towards increasing power supplies in the Sultanate. Oman Power & Water Procurement Company signed a 15-year offtake agreement for power produced by the project.
The $400 million project will be funded on a debt to equity ratio of 70:30. A syndicate of six international and local lenders will provide the $275 million senior debt. The mandated lead banks include Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Bank Muscat, Riyad Bank, Siemens Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Warba Bank.
