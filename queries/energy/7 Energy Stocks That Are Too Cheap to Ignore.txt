The market’s steep selloff over the last two weeks is creating another entry point for long-term energy investors. Now, whether we see more of a decline or a strong short-term rebound is anyone’s guess. On Friday, March 6, oil prices fell by 10% — and they fell over 20% on Monday, March 9. Those staggering drops in oil price came as Russia rejected an OPEC deal that would stabilize prices in the the wake of the coronavirus from China . Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude in response, signaling an all-out price war .
Disciplined income investors should monitor market sentiment carefully. But in the end, focus on the long-term thesis and look at the broader trends in energy stocks.
As it stands now, the sudden drop is beating up big energy names. Yields are rising as prices fall. But chasing yield doesn’t come without risk. As a stock price falls, the paper loss increases, negating any benefit of dividend income.
So why should investors start looking intently at energy stocks? Valuations are just too low. The market is pricing in a prolonged recession. The impact of Covid-19 on the Chinese economy may not last more than one quarter.
Once factories restart, demand for energy will shoot up. So those who bought energy stocks while they were low will see the highest rewards.
With that in mind, here are seven energy stocks too beat up to ignore now.
