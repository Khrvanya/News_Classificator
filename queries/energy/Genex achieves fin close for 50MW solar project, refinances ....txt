December 18 (Renewables Now) - Genex Power Ltd (ASX:GNX) has obtained AUD 192 million (USD 131.5m/EUR 118m) in debt funding for a 100-MW solar portfolio, including the largest certified green loan by an Australian renewable energy group.
The company has agreed a senior loan facility with DZ Bank AG, Nord/LB and Westpac Banking Corporation, as well as a HoldCo facility with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). This debt funding package has allowed Genex to achieve financial close for its 50-MW Jemalong solar project in New South Wales and refinance the existing debt facility for the 50-MW Kidston Solar One Project (KS1) at the Clean Energy Hub in Kidston, North Queensland.
The power producer noted that the senior facility is the first green loan globally to be certified under the latest internationally recognised Climate Bonds Standard v3.0.
Also on Wednesday, Genex said it has initiated building works on the Jemalong scheme, having awarded an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to Beon Energy Solutions, a unit of Victoria Power Networks Pty Ltd. Beon also won the operation and maintenance (O&M) job.
Genex expects the solar park to enter into service in the final quarter of 2020. The plant will be able to produce some 129,450 MWh of electricity per year, which will be sold into the National Electricity Market (NEM).
