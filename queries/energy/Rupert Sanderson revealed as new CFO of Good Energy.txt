Good Energy has announced that Rupert Sanderson has been appointed as chief financial officer and executive director to the board of the company.
He first began working for the company in February 2017, before becoming finance director in January 2018.
Sanderson welcomed the news, saying: "I am looking forward to the opportunity to step up further to support the business in its strategy. This newly expanded role within a company dedicated to fighting climate change is the perfect challenge for me personally to start the decade.”
He has previously held roles including senior financial and commercial positions at Centrica, British Gas, Serco and Avis Europe.
Juliet Davenport, the founder and CEO of Good Energy added: "2020 will be another crucial year for Good Energy, as we deliver new propositions to match the energy transition and address the climate emergency.
“Rupert is a proven strategic and analytical thinker with the ability to be agile, adapt and lead in this evolving market. It is great to kick off 2020 with his skills applied in a broader role where he can have more positive impact."
Good Energy, a supplier and generator of renewable energy, continued to expand its operations in 2019, in an effort to become “more than a passive energy supplier”. This included an agreement with Kraken Technologies, allowing it to adopt the company’s customer services technology platform.
It also launched an EV charging service in October, dubbed 'One Point'. Good Energy says the ‘all-in-one’ EV charging service will be for businesses looking to offer destination or workplace charging.
