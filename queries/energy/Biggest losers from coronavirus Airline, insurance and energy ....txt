'The sector has a reputation for being heavily indebted and a poor track record for seeing through crises. We've already seen Flybe go into administration and we will no doubt see more airlines fail.
He added: 'EasyJet and International Consolidated Airlines have both announced that unprecedented levels of travel restrictions could see a large amount of their fleet grounded. Beyond using the time to do some maintenance, the airlines will simply be sitting on their hands.'

Since the FTSE 100 peaked this year on 17 January at 7,675, it has plunged by a third, with the bulk of the drop having occurred since 24 February.

Oil, insurance and hospitality businesses have also seen massive drops in their share price, with two of the five worst FTSE 350 companies in the previous month being Premier Oil and Tullow Oil, which have declined 86.7 per cent and 81.1 per cent respectively.

Hotel chains like Whitbread's Premier Inn have been severely impacted as well, declining 49.4 per cent due to fewer holidays that have resulted from the growing flight restrictions imposed by countries.
Aside from the reduced hotel stays, says Mould, 'the suppliers to these outlets will also be feeling the pain. The trickle-down effect will stretch even further.'
