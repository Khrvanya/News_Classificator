Australia shares fall as financials, energy stocks weigh; NZ up
The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 5,364.20 points, after shedding 0.4 per cent on Wednesday.
In New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index settled 0.7 per cent higher at 10,649.23.
Australian shares fell on Thursday, pressured by energy and financial stocks, after dismal US data and renewed US-China tensions raised concerns of a slow global economic recovery.
US private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April, as mandatory business closures in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak savaged the world's largest economy.
"Australian April jobs data also due next week so (the US data) is some potential foresight into our own numbers next Thursday," said James Tao, market analyst at CommSec.
The S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 5,364.20 points, after shedding 0.4 per cent on Wednesday. The index is off 25.6 per cent from its lifetime high on Feb. 20, 2020?.
Investors remained on edge as relations between Washington and Beijing turned sour after President Donald Trump earlier in the month threatened retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Trump said on Wednesday he would be able to report in about a week or two whether China is fulfilling its obligations under a Phase 1 trade deal the two countries signed in January before the virus spread globally.
The top percentage losers on the Australian benchmark were waste management company Bingo Industries Ltd, down 5.3 per cent, and analytical laboratory and testing company ALS Ltd , which lost 5.3 per cent.
The worst performer was the heavyweight financial index down 1.5 per cent weighed down by the Big Four banks.
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank Westpac Banking Corp and Commonwealth Bank of Australia fell about 2 per cent each.
Morgan Stanley expects shares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia to fall over the next 2 months, as higher provisions relating to COVID-19 and lower profits may result in investors losing some confidence in the bank's dividend outlook.
The Australian energy index closed 1.1 per cent lower, led by Cooper Energy Ltd, down 5 per cent, and Oil Search , off 2.7 per cent.
Among the gainers, the ASX 300 metals and mining index rose 0.7 per cent helped by a rise in copper prices.

In New Zealand, the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index settled 0.7 per cent higher at 10,649.23.
