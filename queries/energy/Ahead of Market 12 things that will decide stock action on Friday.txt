NEW DELHI: Nifty ended above a key resistance at 10,050 on Thursday, and analysts said the 50-pack is now likely to carry forward this momentum and inch towards the 10,250 level.
Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said technically, Nifty closed above the 10,046 mark and now seems headed for 10,149-10,178 levels. "On any fall, the 9,943-10,046 levels can provide support to the index," he said.
Ajit Mishra of Religare Broking said news related to the stand-off with China and cues from global markets would remain on the radar for market participants. "Since all the sectors are contributing to the current up-move, traders should maintain their focus on stock selection," he said.
Sumeet Bagadia of Choice Broking said Nifty formed a Bullish Marabozu candlestick pattern on the daily chart, which suggests buyers are quite active and there can be a northward rally in the coming days. At its present level, the index has support at 9,900 and resistance at 10,170 levels.
Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, however, said as long as Nifty trades below 10,350 level, the road ahead is not safe. "The bears may try to take control of the market if Nifty starts losing steam between 10,150 and 10,180 levels. Our advice is to reduce weak long positions or take partial profits on long positions between 10,140 and 10,180 levels,” he said.
That said, here’s a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s market action:
The S&P 500 and Dow retreated on Thursday as an uptick in coronavirus infections in parts of the United States threatened to upend bets of a swift economic recovery, with data showing weekly jobless claims remained elevated. At 7:23 pm (IST), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 118.54 points, or 0.45 per cent, at 26,001.07, the S&P 500 was down 4.78 points, or 0.15 per cent, at 3,108.71.
European shares retreated on Thursday as a spike in COVID-19 cases in China and some US states triggered fears of a second wave of infections, knocking back hopes of a swift recovery from the pandemic-led economic slump. Investors scaled back on risk as the daily count of cases hit new highs in California and Texas, two of the United States' most populous states, while Beijing ramped up movement curbs on Wednesday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3 per cent after two straight days of gains, driven by optimism over global stimulus helping economies claw back from the coronavirus-led slide.
Nifty on Thursday formed a solid bullish candle on the daily chart with small lower and upper wicks, suggesting the bulls’ dominance. The index breached the immediate hurdle at 10,000 and analysts said there are good chances that the index might gain further in the coming sessions. Some said the index has been sustaining above its 20-day SMA at 9,775, which is sending out a positive sign for the near term.
The RSI turned northward on Thursday and saw a positive crossover with its average, which has bullish implications. Now, it has to hold above 9,889 level to extend its move towards 10,180 and 10,333 levels, while support is now shifting higher to 9,950 and 9,889 levels. In monthly options, maximum Put open interest stood at 9,000 followed by 9,500 levels, while maximum Call OI stood at 10,500 followed by 10,000 levels. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 9,800 and 10,300 levels.
