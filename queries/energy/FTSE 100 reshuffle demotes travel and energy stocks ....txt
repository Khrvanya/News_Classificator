FTSE Russell’s quarterly rebalance has resulted in a handful of travel and energy stocks being downgraded from the FTSE 100.
Effective 22 June, the four stocks to be removed from the FTSE 100 are travel companies Carnival and EasyJet and energy companies Centrica and Meggitt.
Between the beginning of 2020 and the end of May, Carnival’s and EasyJet’s share prices fell 71% and 52.5%, respectively, as a result of the coronavirus impact on the travel industry.
Similarly, Centrica’s value fell 59.5% and Meggitt fell 57.7% during the same period.
In replacement of the four companies, Avast, GVC Holdings, Homeserve and Kingfishers will be added to the FTSE 100 from previously being included in the FTSE 250.
In 2020, the FTSE 100 peaked on 17 January at £1.9trn total market cap. The index’s performance reached its lowest of £1.3trn on 23 March, the day the UK went into lockdown, which meant a decline of 34.7%.
Since then, the index has recovered reasonably well to £1.6trn which equated to a rebound of 28.6% since its lowest point.
As a result of the few inclusion to the FTSE 100, little impact is being made to the weightings of the sector exposures. The financials sector remains the largest exposure, accounting for 18.8% of the index which is up from 18.4%.
Consumer goods, energy and industrial sectors have all seen their exposures decrease as a result of the rebalance. Surprisingly, health care and telecommunications exposures have also fallen by 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
