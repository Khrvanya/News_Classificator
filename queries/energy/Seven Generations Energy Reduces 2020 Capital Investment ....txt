CALGARY, Alberta — In response to the significant decline in global energy prices, Seven Generations has reduced its previously announced 2020 capital investment budget by 18%, or $200 million, to $900 million. Effective immediately, the company will meaningfully reduce its activity levels to align investments to expected cash flow.
2020 capital investment budget is reduced to $900 million from the previously announced $1.1 billion program and remains fully funded at current futures pricing. This reduction reflects a temporary deferral of planned activity in the present commodity price environment that will afford the company the opportunity to high-grade drilling locations and improve efficiencies.
As a result of this deferred capital investment, 7G expects annual 2020 production to average between 185,000 and 190,000 boe/d. This updated guidance anticipates a similar condensate and total liquids mix to the prior budget.
The company will continue to refine its production, capital allocation and cost structure throughout the year in the context of prevailing market conditions. These efforts, alongside reduced production levels and moderating decline rates are anticipated to improve sustaining capital requirements.
7G’s disciplined hedging program continues to effectively mitigate risks associated with the current low-price environment. Condensate production remains approximately 50% hedged for the balance of 2020 with a WTI floor price above US$50/bbl. Natural gas production is approximately 35% hedged at an equivalent price of US$2.60/MMBtu Henry Hub for the balance of the year.
The reduced capital program for 2020 maintains the company’s strong financial position and liquidity. 7G’s $1.4 billion credit facility was renewed for 5 years at year-end 2019, with a 2024 maturity. The company’s fixed-coupon, senior unsecured notes mature in 2023 and 2025.
“During this time of unprecedented volatility, we have several options available to us to maintain our profitability and financial strength,” said Marty Proctor, 7G’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Strong local condensate pricing, infrastructure ownership, flexible service contracts and our low cost structure gives us the ability to prioritize financial strength over production volumes. Today’s reduced capital and production guidance does not reflect additional cost savings and other optimizations that we are actively pursuing. The company will demonstrate its resilience and emerge from this downturn stronger and better-positioned than ever before.”
7G’s revised 2020 capital budget and production estimates are provided below. The company anticipates providing a detailed update of additional guidance metrics with its first quarter 2020 release.

Seven Generations has adopted the standard of 6 Mcf:1 bbl when converting natural gas to boes. Condensate and other NGLs are converted to boes at a ratio of 1 bbl:1 bbl. Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl is based roughly on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the Company’s sales point. Given the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared to natural gas and NGLs is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 Mcf: 1 bbl and 1 bbl: 1 bbl, respectively, utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 Mcf: 1 bbl for natural gas and 1 bbl: 1 bbl for NGLs, may be misleading as an indication of value.
This news release makes reference to company’s revised forecasted total average daily production of 185 – 190 Mboe/d for 2020. Seven Generations expects that approximately 34% – 38% of that production will be comprised of condensate, 37% – 41% will be comprised of shale gas, 22% will be comprised of other NGLs and 3% will be comprised of conventional natural gas. Other NGLs refers to all natural gas liquids, except for condensate, which is reported separately. Liquids refers to condensate and other NGLs combined.
