Hydrogen fuel cell developer AFC Energy has raised £31.6 million in new capital as it transitions to deliver bigger storage products.
Units ranging from 20kWh to 160kWh are under development and approaching commercial deployment, the firm told investors.
The AIM-listed enterprise has also produced ‘pop-up’ EV charging units, delivering power from fuel cells in grid-constrained locations .
Based around its core technology, an alkaline HydroX-Cell system , AFC has now spun out  variants suitable for power storage and electrolysis.
Next year the firm is set to install hydrogen electrolysers at Britain’s biggest water desalination plant, at Beckton in east London. Spanish water and infrastructure engineers Acciona built the plant in 2010 . It purifies 150,000 cubic meters a day from the Thames.
AFC said its alkaline membrane technology will assist in a process of reverse osmosis, resulting in electrical storage from electrolysed hydrogen.
AFC chief executive Adam Bond greeted a “significant strengthening” of its balance sheet.
“Our business plan is focussed on supporting aspirations for a clean and zero emission society through the use of hydrogen. Today’s raise will further support delivery of our business plan and eventual break even position,” said Bond.
“It will enable AFC Energy for the first time to make material inroads into the scaling up of our manufacturing capability, our internal staffing and system deployment, further demonstrating the underlying strength in the company’s position within the wider hydrogen economy.”
AFC Energy is based at Dunsfold Park, Surrey, revered by petrolheads as the home of motor show Top Gear.
