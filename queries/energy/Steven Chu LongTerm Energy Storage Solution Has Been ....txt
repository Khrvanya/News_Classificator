Amazon Pledges $2 Billion Climate Fund, As Its Carbon Emissions Grow
“Round-trip efficiencies can reach as high as 85 percent,” he said. “In terms of energy storage it’s really one of the best.”
Chu has been touting pumped hydro as a backup for renewable energy at least since he served as President Obama’s first energy secretary in 2009. It can help renewables dominate the grid, he said, at least to 80 percent.
“First, the idea that we have all we need, we can go to 100 percent renewables—somebody’s smoking something,” he said. We’ll still need storage, he said, and there are many sites where water can be moved up and down hill.
“You don’t throw the water away, you keep it down there. So you’re just actually pumping between an upper and a lower reservoir.”
Chu also highlighted compressed air technologies that, like pumped storage, take advantage of mechanical efficiency. But he devoted most attention to pumped hydro. It’s main drawback, he said, is political.
“The problem with hydro is that it takes a long time to get permitting. There are a lot of certain types of environmentalists who are very much against hydro storage. Even if you have an existing dam and you put a pool below the dam that you can pump up and down, they’re against that as well.”
But if officials pursued pumped hydro now, it could be ready to provide 100-day energy storage by the time renewables own 80 percent of the grid.
