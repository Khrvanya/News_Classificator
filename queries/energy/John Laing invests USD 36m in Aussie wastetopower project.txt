January 2 (Renewables Now) - John Laing Group Plc (LON:JLG) has agreed to invest AUD 51.5 million (USD 36m/EUR 32.2m) in a 29-MW thermal waste-to-energy (WTE) plant that Acciona SA (BME:ANA) and Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) will build in Western Australia.
The UK-based infrastructure investor announced the investment in the East Rockingham Resource Recovery Facility last week. This latest investment will bring its total investment commitment in 2019 to around GBP 185 million (USD 244m/EUR 218.2m).
The WTE plant in Perth will treat around 300,000 tonnes of residual waste from municipal, commercial and industrial sources every year, producing enough power to meet the annual demand of more than 36,000 homes. It will be installed at a cost of AUD 510.8 million, with some of the funds to be provided by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). The facility is planned to go live by 2023.
Apart from taking care of all engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) activities,Â Acciona and HZI will hold equity stakes in the project, the Spanish group said in a separate statement.
