Houston oil company Sanchez Energy has exited from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a new CEO and as a privately held company under new leadership and the name Mesquite Energy.
Once among the largest drillers of the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, bankruptcy proceedings allowed the company to shed $2.3 billion of debt. The company's founding CEO Tony Sanchez is leaving the company while chief financial officer Cameron George has been named as interim CEO.
“We are excited to begin our new chapter as Mesquite Energy, a simpler and leaner company, guided by our core principles of cost discipline and production efficiency to create long-term value for our stakeholders,” George said.
