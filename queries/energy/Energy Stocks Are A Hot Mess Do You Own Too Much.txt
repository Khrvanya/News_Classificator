S&P 500 energy stocks are supposed to "come back" any day now. But they're only getting worse — and reaching historically negative levels.
Just a month into 2020, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLE )is already down more than 12%. The year's losses drag the sector down nearly 19% over the past 12 months. Energy is the worst of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 both over the past 12 months and in 2020.
But this is even more important point: The rapidly falling energy sector is rapidly eroding its weighting in the S&P 500. The sector's weight in the S&P 500 is down to just 3.79%, says Bespoke Investment Group. It's now the third least important sector in the S&P 500. That's important as it determines the composition of SPY stock .
Energy not long ago was a powerhouse in the S&P 500. Just in 2008, the S&P 500 energy sector accounted for 16% of the S&P 500, Bespoke says. Energy, in 2008, was tied with technology as the most valuable S&P 500 sector.
If the sector was worth that much now, energy would be the second-largest S&P 500 sector after the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLK ) at 24.3%.
But now, the energy sector is just 27 basis points in weight ahead of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLU ) and only 1.29 percentage points from being the smallest S&P 500 sector. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLB ) is the smallest S&P 500 sector at 2.50% .
It's easy to write off energy stocks, especially with their small S&P 500 weighting. Energy stocks are getting crushed by falling oil prices. Worries the spreading coronavirus will injure economic growth are also punishing energy stocks. Electric cars like those from Tesla ( TSLA ) could also hurt energy firms by reducing demand for oil.
But energy stocks' S&P 500 weighting has dropped before, only to rally back. Energy's weighting fell from 15% to 5% during the 1990s. It sprung back to 15% in a massive oil-price rally, Bespoke says.
Analysts remain bullish on S&P 500 energy stocks. S&P 500 analysts see an average 12-month upside in the 28 S&P 500 energy stocks of 34%.
"A move back up to its average would mean massive outperformance for the Energy sector in the years ahead," Bespoke said.
Just don't hold your breath.
