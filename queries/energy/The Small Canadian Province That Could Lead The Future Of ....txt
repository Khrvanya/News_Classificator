The small modular reactors (SMRs) Saskatchewan is looking at can produce between 50 and 300 megawatts of power. They are aiming for small plants that could even be transportable. We have written about small modular nuclear reactors before , including its benefits for businesses and small municipalities. For a full province of 251,700 square miles and almost 1.2 million people, these SMRs would provide flexibility and cost efficiency, with the added benefit of providing electricity without pollution.
It is often cost prohibitive to build large, traditional nuclear power plants. Utilities and governments just don’t want to build them anymore. According to the Energy Information Administration, the average age of a nuclear plant in the United States is 39 years old . SMRs can be commissioned for much less. They are also ideal for smaller population centers, and the largest city in the province, Saskatoon, has fewer than 300,000 people. SMRs could also be great power sources for factories and server farms.
Saskatchewan is still committed to solar and wind projects to operate in conjunction with traditional power generation like natural gas-powered plants. However, if Saskatchewan does proceed with its nuclear ambitions, it could be a great example and guide for governments across the world.

I’m an energy historian writing about how governments and energy businesses interact globally.  My work looks at how policy, wars, diplomacy, the stock market, oil pricing, and innovation impact the future of energy.  I am the president of Transversal Consulting, a firm that provides consulting on energy and geopolitics to a range of industries. I am also a Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council. My book, Saudi, Inc., (Pegasus Books, 2018) covers the history and policy of Aramco and Saudi Arabia.
