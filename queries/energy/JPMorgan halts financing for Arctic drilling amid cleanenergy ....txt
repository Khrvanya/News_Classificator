New England Investment and Retirement Group's Nick Giacoumakis explains his confidence in solar-energy projects.
JPMorgan Chase , the largest U.S. bank, will no longer provide loans for new oil and gas drilling projects in the Arctic.
The policy, which the bank announced Tuesday, is part of its broader efforts to promote clean-energy consumption. JPMorgan is also halting loans, capital markets and advisory services to companies that draw most of their revenues from coal mining and has committed $200 billion to the United Nations sustainable development goals.
The New York-based lender's decision follows a similar move at rival Goldman Sachs , which said in December it wouldn't finance oil exploration or development in any part of the Arctic, including the National Wildlife Refuge. The decisions come amid mounting activist pressure on U.S. corporations to alter policies on fossil fuels after President Trump did an about-face from his predecessor's commitments to fight climate change, as well as to weigh in on other hot-button political issues.
