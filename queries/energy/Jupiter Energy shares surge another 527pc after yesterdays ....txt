What an amazing couple of days it’s been for shareholders of Kazakhstan-focused oil play Jupiter Energy (ASX:JPR) . Shares rose 1000 per cent yesterday and they are still heading north today.
The stock closed on Tuesday at 0.2c but closed a day later at 5.5c. This was even better than 2020’s previous one day rise record holder — gold junior Predictive Discovery (ASX:PDI) which gained 733 per cent last week.
Today Jupiter advanced another 527 per cent to an intra-day high of 34.5c. It has since edged back to 14.5c, but that is still a further gain of 164 per cent.
Jupiter Energy was unable to escape earlier pressure, making the call in late March to shut down production.
But last week it secured a more attractive prepayment proposal from a local trader.
It said the new contract and further cost cutting measures would enable production from the Akkar North and West Zhetybai oil fields to continue.
Jupiter received a please explain letter from ASX yesterday about the rise. The company said it had no explanation other than its news from a week earlier.
Today it released its March quarterly.
Jupiter sold 8,500 barrels of oil for $US117,000 ($185,770) — representing an average price of $US14 ($22) per barrel. But because these are amortised over several months, cash receipts for the quarter were actually nil.
The company said this morning it had cut its workforce by nearly a third and was reviewing its drilling program and field operations.
Jupiter said it hopes to continue production and undertake drilling work, but it will need more money.
