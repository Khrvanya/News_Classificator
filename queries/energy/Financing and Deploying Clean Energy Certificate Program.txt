This online certificate program trains and connects rising leaders to catalyze the transition to a clean economy.
Yale's year-long, admissions-based online Certificate in Financing and Deploying Clean Energy is for working professionals who seek to accelerate the transition to a clean economy. This program helps professionals understand the interplay of the financial, technological, and socioeconomic drivers in financing and deploying clean energy.
The world urgently needs leaders with capacity in the areas of policy, finance, and clean technology; in 2017, the International Energy Agency estimated that $3.5 trillion per year in energy investments would be required until 2050 to offset the rise in carbon emissions. Of these, approximately $1 trillion per year must be dedicated to the deployment and financing of clean energy. The challenges—and the opportunities—are both immense and immediate.
To tackle them, all must come together to develop innovative approaches to how we produce, distribute, and consume energy. It requires a cross-sectoral approach and an interdisciplinary lens. It requires an informed workforce and powerful knowledge networks. And it requires sharp skills and a willingness to learn.
This is precisely why the Yale Center for Business and the Environment (CBEY) has drawn on its vast network of professionals and on the expertise of Yale faculty to offer a unique program marrying academic rigor with practical skills. Learn more about the certificate here .
