In 2020 so far, shares of state-run oil and gas producer, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) have declined about 37% from its highs in January. As it turns out, the company’s March quarter results announced on Wednesday evening don’t inspire much confidence.
True, standalone revenues at Rs21456 crore, representing 20% year-on-year decline were ahead of Street estimates. Net crude oil price realisations declined by almost 21% to $49.01 a barrel, as broader crude prices were lower. Oil and gas volumes declined by 7.3% and 10.6%, respectively.
An increase of 11% in other expenses weighed on profits, especially when other components of operating costs have declined. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) declined by 30.6% to Rs8588 crore. Further, other income declined sharply and there was also an impairment loss of about Rs4900 crore, pertaining to the implications of covid-19 on business conditions. The upshot: ONGC reported a net loss of Rs3098 crore.
Analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a report on 30 June, “Impairment is now a global phenomenon with majors Shell and BP Plc too planning to take hit thereof."
After a disappointing ending to financial year 2020, prospects for the ONGC stock are not turning brighter. Brent crude oil prices had dropped to a low of $19 a barrel in April, as covid-19 demand concerns weighed on prices. While oil prices have recovered from the lows to about $42 per barrel, triggers for a meaningful jump in oil prices are few and far between, as covid-19 pandemic is likely to keep a check on demand in the near-to-medium term. This won’t augur well for ONGC, as higher oil prices translate into better realisations for the company.
Production is another area of concern. For the March quarter, the decline in gas production was sharper at about 8% compared to the 1.4% drop in crude oil production. Of course, investors will watch for visible improvements on this front. Here, the outlook on oil production growth remains subdued whereas gas production is expected to be relatively better.
Edelweiss expects ONGC’s Rs80000 crore worth of projects under implementation to revive gas production from FY20–23E.
Still, sentiments for the stock are not running high. Kotak Institutional Equities reiterates its ‘sell’ rating on the stock given expected sharp decline in domestic gas prices, recurring disappointment on volumes, elevated operating/ capex costs and policy apathy amid weak oil cycle.
