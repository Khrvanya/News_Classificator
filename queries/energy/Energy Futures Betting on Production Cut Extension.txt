Oil prices are on the rise again as it appears that OPEC and Russia are poised to extend production cuts. The big question mark, as usual, is Russia, with what seems to be uncertainty about how long they want to extend cuts. They say they will wait until Tuesday to make a decision. Mexico may also be a problem, yet it’s clear that if OPEC+ wants to see oil prices continue to rise, they should extend cuts.
Regardless, it appears that OPEC + will meet early on June 5 to iron out the details, and the market is betting they will extend cuts by at least one month until the end of July. What’s amazing in this market are signs of tightening supply globally. Brent crude is on track to test $40.00 and has now gone from contango to backwardation. That is signaling that the market has gone from oversupplied to under-supplied. Demand in Germany, along with China, has exceeded pre-Covid-19 levels indicating that oil demand globally will be back in a big way and much faster than many people thought.
