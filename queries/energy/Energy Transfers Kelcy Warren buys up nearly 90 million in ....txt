It’s his second major purchase in the just over three months.
Energy Transfer CEO Kelcy Warren is continuing to buy stock in the Dallas-based pipeline giant he created.
In the last two weeks, Warren bought nearly $90 million in shares as the company’s stock price fell to just above $10. It closed Monday at $11.83, up about 6.5%. He made the purchases in separate transactions Feb. 19 and Feb. 27, according to regulatory filings .
That raises Warren’s ownership stake to about 260 million shares -- worth more than $3 billion at Monday’s closing price.
Energy Transfer shares dropped about 12% in the last month, first on oil and gas price worries and then on coronavirus fears.
It marks the second time in just over three months that Warren made a sizeable bet on the company’s future. He bought $45 million in shares in November.
Warren is among Dallas’ wealthiest residents, with a net worth estimated at $4.8 billion by the Hurun Report.
Energy Transfer is Dallas-Fort Worth’s fourth largest public company , trailing only Exxon Mobil, McKesson and AT&T. It had revenue of $54.2 billion in 2019.
