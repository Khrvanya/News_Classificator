Deutsche Börse’s energy arm to buy NFX’s core assets, as Nasdaq gives up on its effort to break into commodities
Nasdaq Inc. said it has agreed to sell its struggling energy-futures business, NFX, to a unit of German exchange group Deutsche Börse, giving up on its four-year effort to break into commodities.
NFX’s core assets—including its oil, gas, electricity, metals and freight futures markets—will be transferred to Deutsche Börse’s energy arm, EEX Group, by 2020 as part of the transaction, Nasdaq and EEX said in a joint statement Tuesday. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.
