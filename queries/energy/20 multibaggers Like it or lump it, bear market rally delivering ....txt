20 multibaggers! Like it or lump it, bear market rally delivering big winners
Twenty BSE500 stocks have delivered 100-200 per cent returns from their March 24.
Glenmark Pharma has also climbed 109 per cent, ever since the firm initiated human trials of Favipiravir. Infibeam Avenues doubled investor money and a few brokerages see more upside.
NEW DELHI: There may be many question marks over the rally seen in domestic stocks over the past few weeks. But Dalal Street is already delivering multibaggers.
Twenty BSE500 stocks have delivered 100-200 per cent returns from their March 24 lows in sharp contrast to the weak economic scenario the country is grappling with.
Some of these looked like cases of value buying, while others could have been mere speculation.
The stocks included Vodafone Idea, which is up 200 per cent from its March 24 low. CLSA in March assigned a 12-month target of Rs 12 on the stock, which it breached this week within three months.
The stock has been rising on hopes that the company may attract investment amid an investor frenzy in the country’s telecom space. “It can emerge as a dark horse,” said Hemang Jani of Motial Oswal Securities.
Penny stock Jain Irrigation has gained 168 per cent, Reliance Power 145 per cent and Suzlon Energy 140 per cent. Retail and HNI investors hold anywhere between 45 per cent and 53 per cent in the three stocks, which eroded up to 90-98 per cent investor wealth in last 10 years. These companies are in various stages of debt resolution.
Recent media reports suggest Jain Irrigation has submitted a proposal to its lenders seeking Rs 4,000 crore in loans restructuring. In case of Reliance Power, lenders have agreed to work on a debt resolution plan and are in the process of implementing the same. The power company has, meanwhile, won a lawsuit award of $68 million, or Rs 510 crore.
In Suzlon's case, shareholders have approved the resolutions proposed by the company, thus paving the way for debt restructuring.
Among other multibaggers of the bear phase, Aurobindo Pharma NSE 0.52 % soared 147 per cent from its March lows against a 33 per cent rise in BSE Sensex. Despite this, Emkay Global has retained 'buy' rating on the stock with significant overweight.
“Strong execution and debt reduction should continue to drive the stock’s outperformance," it said.
Another pharma stock, Jubilant Life Sciences, has rallied 127 per cent. The company recently secured rights from Gilead Sciences to produce anti-viral Remdesvir that is being used as a Covid 19 treatment.
Glenmark Pharma has also climbed 109 per cent, ever since the firm initiated human trials of Favipiravir. Infibeam Avenues doubled investor money and a few brokerages see more upside.
"Shares of Infibeam have rallied 63 per cent since our last update on April 15 and are currently trading at a P/E multiple of 27.1 times/17.3 times on FY21/FY22 earnings. We expect topline and earnings to expand 43 per cent and 57 per cent YoY in FY22 and apply a P/E multiple of 21.9 times to the FY22 estimated EPS of Rs 3.31 and to arrive at a target of Rs 72 per share, an upside of 27 per cent over the prevailing price,” KR Choksey Shares and Securities said in a note.
Adani Green Energy has risen 121 per cent since March 24. In April, global energy giant Total invested around Rs 3,707 crore for a 50 per cent partnership with Adani Green Energy for a joint venture for solar power projects across 11 states in India.
The company said more foreign investors have shown interest in partnering Adani group in its renewable energy business. On Tuesday, the company bagged the world's largest solar project worth $6 billion.
HEG, GMM Pfaudler, Hathway Cable & Datacom, Reliance Infrastructure, PC Jewellers and KRBL are some of the 20 BSE500 stocks which doubled investor money from their March lows.
