The Clean Energy Finance Corporation's close relationship with fintech firm RateSetter will be investigated by the federal government amid concerns other green energy lenders are missing out on lucrative contracts.
Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor on Monday referred the matter to the head of his department after The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed widespread industry concerns about the Commonwealth body and RateSetter teaming up to win two state government contracts worth more than $100 million that did not go out to tender.
The CEFC says RateSetter is not an exclusive partner.
The CEFC claims it is not behind the decisions of the NSW and South Australian governments to choose RateSetter as its partner.
But the South Australian energy department on Monday said the CEFC nominated RateSetter to administer the financing component of the scheme.
"RateSetter was subsequently appointed to administer the subsidy as well as the finance, in line with state government procurement processes," a spokesman for the department said.
Brighte chief executive Katherine McConnell said she believed the CEFC had been actively lobbying the Commonwealth and state governments to have RateSetter be the exclusive provider of finance for any government solar and battery program.
"Furthermore, the CEFC has created the impression that Australian government funding is contingent on using only RateSetter as their exclusive finance partner," Ms McConnell wrote.
"The CEFC has been successful in achieving this outcome with the South Australian Home Battery Scheme and now the NSW Empowering Homes Program, which was announced on Friday.
"We are concerned that any subsequent tender for this particular program will not be a fair and transparent process for industry participants and the NSW Government, to the detriment of Australian consumers and taxpayers."
Mr Taylor told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald last night: "In order to ensure ongoing public confidence in the CEFC, I have asked my Departmental Secretary to lead an independent review and report back to me on these issues."
Under both schemes, the CEFC provides finance for loans for solar panels or battery systems that are administered by RateSetter.
The growing concerns within the industry come as the CEFC's former chief investment risk officer, Stephen Panizza, is now involved with a company that is a major investor in RateSetter.
