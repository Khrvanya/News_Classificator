Energy Transition , Environment and Sustainability , Hydrogen: Beyond the Hype
As the push towards clean fuels intensifies, many alternate energy sources are figuring in discussions among policy makers in Asia, as they prepare for energy transition. One fuel that has garnered a lot of attention is hydrogen. From finding low-cost production methods to creating a transparent price discovery mechanism, hydrogen has a few challenges to overcome to make bigger inroads into leading Asia-Pacific markets, says Edgare Kerkwijk, Board Member of the Asia-Pacific Hydrogen Association, in an interview with S&P Global Platts Senior Editor Sambit Mohanty.
Platts launched hydrogen assessments in December 2019 based on the value of hydrogen produced in the US and Europe. In April this year, Platts increased its market coverage to produce daily hydrogen price assessments for Japan.
