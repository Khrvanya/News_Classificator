Saudi Arabian energy company ACWA Power along with its consortium partners Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) and Alternative Energy Projects Co (AEPC) has achieved financial closure.
The achievement is for the 500MW solar photovoltaic (PV) Independent Power Project (IPP), located in the Sultanate of Oman.
For this $400m project, a syndicate of six international and local lenders have agreed to offer $275m senior debt.
The lenders include the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Bank Muscat, Riyad Bank, Siemens Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Warba Bank.
These financial institutions have agreed to finance the project on a 16.5-year door-to-door tenor.
It will be AIIB’s first renewable energy financing in Oman and in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region.
ACWA Power CEO Paddy Padmanathan said: “We are pleased to partner with GIC and AEPC on the largest utility-scale solar IPP in Oman.
