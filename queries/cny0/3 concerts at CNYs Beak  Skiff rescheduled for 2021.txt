The 1911 Established distillery , part of Beak & Skiff, shifted its operations to producing sanitizers at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, making 2,000 cases of 12-ounce hand sanitizers a day and distributing them to stores. Beak & Skiff has also pivoted to hosting pop-up drive-in movies this summer; its next event is a family-friendly Disney night on July 3.
