Is China manipulating its currency like Trump suggests?
The gap between the onshore- and offshore-traded Chinese yuan is growing, offering evidence that the People’s Bank of China is not willfully devaluing its currency, says Dankse Bank chief analyst Allan von Mehren.
On Thursday, the yuan hit a one-year low against the dollar, and the PBOC lowered its dollar-yuan reference rate by the most in two years on Friday , leading investors to address the question of whether the central bank was actively devaluing its currency, potentially as a tactic in the trade negotiations.
But this theory is easily dispelled, according to research by von Mehren, who believes the yuan weakness was driven by market forces, including a generally strengthening dollar in recent months, as well as worries over the result of the U.S.-China trade spat that hit Asian currencies across the board.
Rather than deliberately weakening the yuan, the People’s Bank of China “aims to dampen the depreciation as part of the ‘countercyclical factor’ of the fixing,” he said about the central bank moving the fixed dollar-yuan rate lower over the past days.
Von Mehren points to the offshore yuan market as evidence of missing manipulation. It’s in this market that the Chinese currency is traded more freely than on the mainland. The offshore yuan USDCNH,
has been much more stable, “which indicates the PBOC is not making any strong attempt to stop the onshore yuan weakening, as it is increasingly allowing the markets to determine the currency as long as it does not risk causing instability,” he said.
More evidence for a markets-led yuan depreciation, rather than a central bank-driven devaluation, can be found in the euro-yuan rate. The fact that China’s currency also weakened versus its eurozone rival and not just the dollar suggests a broader market move and not a targeted dollar-yuan action, von Mehren’s research showed.
