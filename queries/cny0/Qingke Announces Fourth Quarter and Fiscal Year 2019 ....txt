We also further widened our leading position in the industry, evidenced by the number of awards granted to us by prominent industry organizations in recognition of our asset quality.
During the quarter, we adopted a defensive strategy after a prudent assessment of the broader macroeconomic downturn by consolidating our internal resources，further improving our operating efficiencies and focusing on asset quality improvement rather than aggressive expansion. In the fourth quarter, our average month-end occupancy rate reached 95.8%, increasing 360 basis points year-over-year, and our period-average occupancy rate was 94.4%, an increase of 320 basis points year-over-year, a new record high, even by peak season standards.
We believe we are well positioned in the Yangtze mega-city cluster centered around Shanghai, which is a strategically important region in China with particularly vibrant growth, and we have built a resilient business model that can effectively weather an economic downturn. As we continue to strengthen our technology and management capabilities, and further improve the user experience while scaling our business, we are confident that we will be able to become the standard setter in China’s long-term apartment rental industry.”
