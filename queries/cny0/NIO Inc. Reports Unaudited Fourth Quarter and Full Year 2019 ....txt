Our ES6 ranked No.1 in electric SUV sales in China for the fifth consecutive month since October 2019.
“We started 2020 in a challenging environment due to the COVID-19 outbreak. While we keep safety and health of our global employees a top priority, our teams strive to resume productions, expand our traffic channels, integrate our online and offline sales efforts and offer best services possible to bring business and operation back to normal. Looking into year 2020, we are confident that we will produce the most competitive electric SUVs in China, including ES6, all-new ES8 and EC6, together with more comprehensive battery and power solutions. We are pleased to see our growing user community becoming an essential part of our brand and business growth. We have covered 59 cities with 22 NIO Houses and 62 NIO Spaces in China, which efficiently support our branding and sales efforts. We are well prepared to proceed through the headwind and become stronger in 2020,” concluded Mr. Li.
“We are pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the top line growing 55.1% from the previous quarter,” added Wei Feng, NIO’s chief financial officer. “We have put great efforts to optimize our organizations and to improve operation efficiency, which resulted in certain one-off expenses in the fourth quarter. However, we believe that these efforts will significantly reduce our operating expenses and improve our cash flows in 2020 and beyond. We will continue to improve operation efficiency in all business fronts to bring positive changes to the performance of our margins in the future.
“Additionally, we made several private placements of convertible notes in February and March 2020, in an aggregate principal amount of US$435 million, which supported our daily operations and business development. On February 25, 2020, we entered into a collaboration framework agreement with the municipal government of Hefei, Anhui Province, who expects to provide resources and funding support for NIO to establish NIO China headquarters in Hefei for our long-term growth. The parties are working on the legally binding definitive documents to be signed.”

Balance of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment was RMB 1,056.3 million (US$151.7 million) as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s cash balance is not adequate to provide the required working capital and liquidity for continuous operation in the next 12 months. The Company’s continuous operation depends on the Company’s capability to obtain sufficient external equity or debt financing. The Company will continue to work on financing projects to improve its liquidity and cash position. However, the consummation of any additional financing project is subject to inherent uncertainties. Based on the management’s assessment, as a result of the relevant conditions and events including continuous losses, net cash outflows, negative working capital, negative equity and uncertainties on consummation of the financing projects, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The fourth quarter and full year unaudited financial information does not include any adjustment that is reflective of this uncertainty. The Company will announce any material developments or information subject to the requirements by applicable laws.

Deliveries of the vehicles to be between 3,400 and 3,600 vehicles, representing a decrease of approximately 56.2% to 58.7% from the fourth quarter of 2019, and a decrease of approximately 9.8% to 14.8% from the first quarter of 2019.
