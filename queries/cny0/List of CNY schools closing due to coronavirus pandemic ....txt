A number of school districts in the Central New York area are closing Monday, including some in Onondaga County that Saturday announced their plans to close.
Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon announced earlier Saturday that the county was ordering all Onondaga County schools to close after school Friday due to the coronavirus pandemic. The order called for the schools to remain closed through at least April 13.
We have started a list of the closings. This list is changing frequently as more districts announce plans to close. Weâ€™ll continue to update the list as it changes.
