This report outlines some of the steps taken in recent years by the Chinese government to promote the international use of the RMB, which in turn is linked to moves to open up China’s capital account. Given China’s rising shares of global GDP and trade, these steps are gaining traction and portend a rising role for the RMB in global trade and finance. The report then reviews the potential implications of these changes for capital flows into and out of China. The report evaluates the progress that China has made in various aspects of financial market development and discusses the close relationship between those reforms, capital account openness, and the international role of the currency. It also discusses the prospects for the RMB becoming a reserve currency and the implications that could have for the global configuration of reserve currencies and the U.S. economy.
The Chinese government’s approach to policies that promote the RMB’s use as an international currency is closely linked to domestic macroeconomic objectives and financial market development. The RMB’s impact on the global monetary system—in particular whether it will contribute positively to global financial stability—depends on the manner and speed with which China opens up its capital account and develops its financial markets as well as on the other policy changes put in place to support this process and the implications for China’s own growth and stability.
