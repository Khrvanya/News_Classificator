Earnestine Williams poses at her home in Syracuse. She turned 103 on Sunday, April 19, 2020.
FROM SPANISH FLU TO CORONAVIRUS: Earnestine Williams as a baby lived through the Spanish flu of 1918, one of the world’s most deadly pandemics that killed 50 million. Now, at 103, she’s living through the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Williams finds coronavirus an annoyance that has kept her away from three of her favorite activities — volunteer work, church and bingo. For the past 40 years, she has served as a volunteer senior companion through the state Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities. Until the pandemic hit, she was visiting clients four days a week, sitting with them and helping to feed them. When things are safe, Earnestine plans to return to her volunteer work. “As long as you’re able, why not go?” (Nolan Weidner photo)
