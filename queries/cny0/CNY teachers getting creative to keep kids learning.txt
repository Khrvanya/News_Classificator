SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — Central New York teachers are getting creative in their efforts to keep kids learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the video above, Lucas Cognetti, a first-grade teacher at Syracuse Academy of Science and Citizenship Charter School on Valley Drive, shows how he is being creative.
He and his fellow teachers are using social media as a platform to connect with the kids.
Cognetti’s special classroom reading chair is still in the classroom, so he made his own out of snow!
