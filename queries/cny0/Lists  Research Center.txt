In the CNYBJ Research Center, you will find the most recent data on businesses and nonprofit organizations in the 16-county Central New York Region. You will also be able to obtain access to the weekly Top Ranks lists, the annual Book of Lists, and other custom publications.
Central New York includes Broome, Cayuga, Chemung, Chenango, Cortland, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, St. Lawrence, Seneca, Tioga, and Tompkins counties.
Each weekly print edition of The Central New York Business Journal includes a list of the top companies or nonprofit organizations in a particular industry or category, ranked by a statistical criterion. At the end of the year, the weekly lists, plus the lists that appear in the bimonthly HealthCare Provider and other custom publications, are compiled, updated and republished in the annual Book of Lists. As a result, this book of 60-plus lists becomes a powerful resource tool that provides essential details on the businesses, nonprofits, and key decision makers in the 16-county Central New York region.
The data found in the lists, directories, Book of Lists and other custom publications come directly from the companies themselves, and occasionally, other public sources. Surveys are emailed to Central New York companies asking them to fill in data fields specific to its industry. Companies are only considered for the list if they complete and submit the survey back to us by the deadline date.
