Slide erases recent gains chalked up after the U.S. removed China from list of currency manipulators
Chinaâ€™s currency weakened ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as the widening spread of the Wuhan coronavirus fanned worries of a deeper economic slowdown in parts of the country.
The yuan traded at 6.9263 against the U.S. dollar in offshore trading Friday afternoon in Hong Kong, after declining around 1% this week. Onshore, the currency fell by a similar magnitude before Chinese markets closed Jan 24 for a weeklong holiday.
