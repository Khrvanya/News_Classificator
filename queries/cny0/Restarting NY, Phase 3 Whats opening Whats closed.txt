Central New York appears on track to move into phase 3 of New Yorkâ€™s plan to reopen businesses that were closed in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon said he is hopeful the high number of tests and low rate of infection will convince Gov. Andrew Cuomo to start phase three in CNY this weekend.
Here are the businesses and services that could open when Central New York reaches phase three, according to guidance the state posted earlier this week.
Restaurants will be able to serve food and drinks indoors.
This includes all places that sell food: Restaurants, bars, food trucks.
They will have to limit capacity to half of the maximum occupancy, exclusive of employees. Tables inside and out must be spaced six feet apart. Staff will wear masks at all times. Customers can take off their masks while seated. Tables will be limited to 10 people. The state recommends restaurants provide single-use, disposable menus or display menus in a common place. Restaurants should limit the use of devices like buzzers to alert customers that seating or an order is ready.
