Alibaba beat the street in today's earnings release.
Billionaire Jack Ma is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of his e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), but that doesn’t mean it’s going down the tubes. Not only is Alibaba trading at around two times less than Amazon (AMZN), it just beat consensus on earnings.
Alibaba’s shares rose over 3.25% in New York this morning thanks to some much needed good business news out of China. Long-term China investors still have a reason to be bullish.
Alibaba vice-chairman Joe Tsai basically thanked China’s 300+ million urban middle class for buying on its platforms, a sign that despite overall weaker national retail numbers than in previous years, the China consumer is alive and kicking.
Here are some of the numbers:
Core retail e-commerce +40% annually, 66% of BABA's total revenue
Cloud computing +66% annually, roughly 7% of total revenue.
They now have 755 million mobile users, up 34 million versus market estimates of 721 million total mobile users.
Alibaba has 674 million active accounts, double the population of the United States and double Amazon’s actives.
