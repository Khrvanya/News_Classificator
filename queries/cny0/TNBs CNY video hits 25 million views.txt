The web-film, which was filled with humour, revolved around the subject matter of how festivals were usually more meaningful when celebrated with family, Roslan said.
“We are happy to share that ‘Reality Not Virtual’ has received overwhelming response from the public. We are grateful to all TNB customers and followers.
“This achievement has motivated TNB to come up with better festival-related films in the future. We hope the momentum will continue to inspire us to produce more heartwarming, humour-filled and insightful messages that the public can relate to,” he said in a statement.
The video was also featured together with international web films from Apple, Coca Cola and Samsung by Ads of the World, an advertising archive and community that showcased creative advertisements from all over the world to welcome the Chinese New Year celebration.
The web film was uploaded on Jan 17 on TNB's official YouTube page, TENAGAofficial, while a 60-second video was aired on television starting from Jan 23.
