April 29 is World Wish Day while the Central New York Make-A-Wish Foundation is celebrating its 35th anniversary.
The local chapter has granted about 2,000 requests to kids with life threatening illnesses since 1985.
The chapter started a "35 Hours of Giving" campaign.
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only stopped the granting of wishes temporarily, but it has also canceled many fundraising efforts.
Everything from college fundraisers to golf tournaments have been canceled or postponed.
Chapter officials said they estimate a loss of about $500,000.
"While wishes have stopped, illnesses haven't," said CNY Make A Wish Foundation President and CEO Diane Kuppermann. "And, all those kids in our pipeline, those wishes are going to have to be pushed back until we can catch up the revenue and get them going but we will. We have confidence. I'm optimistic. Our community is amazing."
The Make-A-Wish Foundation is celebrating its 40th anniversary worldwide this year.
About 500,000 wishes have been granted around the world in that time.
