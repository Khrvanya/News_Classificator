SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — Shoppers and vendors are excited to get back to the CNY Regional Market’s Sunday Flea Markets, but before they head inside, there are some things to keep in mind as we adjust to the new normal.
Tim Rowland has been a vendor at the flea market for more than 25 years, and he said the market has been doing well with the new and needed adjustments.
“The market did every other booth so we would keep our social distancing. Everybody was wearing a mask, so it turned out good,” Rowland said.
Customers and vendors must wear a mask that covers their mouth and nose at all times. Customers are also asked to follow the one-way traffic flow in each building and to not block the walkways while shopping. Do not touch vendor products to avoid cross contamination and if you feel sick, stay home.
“I think being outside and being outdoors and being active is pretty important. Hopefully it keeps the community healthy. Maybe we can find some pros in a situation like this, but it’s important to go out little by little and don’t take advantage of the situation,” says Jewel Slade, a shopper at the market’s opening day.
Some vendors are even getting creative with the items they sell; offering custom designed masks for purchase.
Although Sunday was the flea market’s first day back in business, the Farmers Markets on Thursdays and Saturdays have been running through the pandemic, due to being an essential service.
The flea market is open during its normal hours, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., on Sundays.
