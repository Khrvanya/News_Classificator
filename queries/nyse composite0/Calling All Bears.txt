What it Means: In the February 4 column Do Stocks Have Enough Juice to Breakout? I made the case for why stocks could breakout to the upside despite the increase in bearish headlines. There were no warning signs of a significant correction at the time.
Though the daily studies are not all as strong as I would like, they are still positive. If the major averages does a rally failure at the recent highs in the next week, or so, then we may see a further correction.
It is possible that the bearish sentiment has already reached high enough levels to set the stage for another push to new all time highs. A higher weekly close will be a positive sign.

I began analyzing the financial markets in 1982 when I became the research director for a financial advisory firm and provided regular market analysis on stocks, commodities, currencies and mutual funds. I am a technical analyst. Much of my focus was on how obscure technical indicators or methods, could be applied to the financial markets and used as an effective trading tool. Many of the indicators I have used for years, such as Gerry Appell's MACD and Welles Wilder's RSI, have subsequently gained wide popularity. This page is devoted to sharing my insights and techniques in order to help you become a smarter trader/investor. Over the past twenty years I have traveled around the world several times, visiting all of the major financial centers as he taught professional traders and money managers my approach to the financial markets.  My method of stock selection starts with a proprietary scanning method to select a group of individual stocks for more extensive analysis. This includes an in-depth study of the volume patterns that I use to determine the strength of a stock's trend. Those with the strongest trend, either up or down, are then further analyzed to determine entry, exit and risk levels. I use Fibonacci retracement, projection and extension analysis to determine both profit objectives as well as stops.
