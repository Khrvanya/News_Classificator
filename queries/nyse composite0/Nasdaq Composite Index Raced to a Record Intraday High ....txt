‘The ‘Flash Recession’ Is Over, Says Former Janus CEO
The Nasdaq tumbled over 30% in the bear market that followed, until it bottomed 23 trading days later on March 23 . It has been nothing but up since then, as unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus was put into place and progress on reopening locked-down economies unfolded faster than expected. The view on main street remains starkly different to that on Wall Street, but stocks are forward looking—and right now the view points to a recovery underway .
If the Nasdaq manages to rise at least 3.1 points on Monday, the 76-day return to a record high would be the second-fastest rebound on record, after the 65 days ending on April 9, 2009, according to Dow Jones Market Data—measured as the time it takes from the previous bull market high to setting a record in a new bull market. The average recovery for the Nasdaq has taken 1,018 trading days. For bear markets in which the index lost at least 30%, the average recovery has taken even longer—1,528 trading days.
The Nasdaq’s heavier weighting in technology and health-care companies helped its performance in 2020’s coronavirus market. Those sectors have seen their earnings and projected results hold up much better than more cyclical or economically sensitive pockets of the market , like industrials, financials, or energy companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remains 9% below its Feb. 12 record, while the S&P 500 has about 6% to go to surpass its Feb. 19 all-time high.
