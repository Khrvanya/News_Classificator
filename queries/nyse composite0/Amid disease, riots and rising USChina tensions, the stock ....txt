added 0.6%. So far in June, the Dow is up 8.5%, the S&P 500 8.8% and the Nasdaq 11.7%, according to FactSet.
Stock-market bulls also point to past instances of social unrest as evidence for optimism. “History shows there is simply no correlation between social/political turmoil and U.S. stock market returns,” wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, in a Monday note. He pointed to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment in 1999 and the Occupy Wall Street protests that began in 2011 as examples when discord coincided with positive returns on equity.
The most compelling example, however, may be the historically tumultuous year of 1968, when America  and the world were gripped by political and military crises, but stocks did just fine.
“1968 saw two high profile political assassinations in the U.S., the Tet offensive in Vietnam, the start of the Hong Kong flu pandemic, riots in Chicago at the Democratic Convention, and the shutdown of the French economy from mass protests,” Colas wrote. “The S&P 500’s total return in that year was 10.8%.”
What does seem to be pushing markets higher, Baird’s Delwiche said, is the improving data related to coronavirus outbreak in the  U.S. and the economy. “The market isn’t looking for good news or bad news, but the direction the news is going.”
Of course, at a certain point investors will demand more than just news of economic restrictions being lifted and an improvement in the health situation — they’ll need to see that improvement manifest in hard data. “The improvement in the macro environment has been the easy parts,” wrote Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report, in a Tuesday note to clients.
“Governors declared states to reopen and virus cases have declined,” he added. “Now comes the hard part where the economy needs to start moving again and we need to see massive and rapid improvement in economic numbers, all the while not having any hints of second wave of infections.”
