The S&P 500 hit a new high just three weeks ago , confirming that it’s still in a bull market. If only we could say the same thing about other market indexes.
Consider: In the simplest form, an index is said to be in a bull market if it has gained more than 20% off a bear-market low, and a bear market if it drops 20% from a bull-market high . But these things are never simple. If an index is trading below its all-time high, but hasn’t dropped 20%, it is in a state of limbo —one where we don’t know if it’s still in a bull market, or heading for a bear—though we usually give it the benefit of the doubt. If the market has rallied back after a 20% drop, however, it is usually thought of as a bull market in a secular bear until that new high is made.
Which bring us back to the current market—which is sending mixed messages, according to a note from Ned Davis Research’s Ned Davis. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high of 2945.83 on April 30, confirming its bull market was alive and well following last year’s fourth-quarter selloff.
      meanwhile, hit a new record of 8164.00 on May 3, confirming its own bull market.
      however, has yet to surpass its Oct. 3 high of 26,828.39 and is currently living in that no-man’s land between bull and bear, Davis writes, “and rather looks like it may be a triple top.”
The MSCI All Country World Index ex U.S. index hasn’t hit a new high since January 2018, and neither has the NYSE Composite Index ,
“They tell me that many stocks are in an ongoing bear market,” writes Davis.
So which is right? Davis acknowledges just how unclear the evidence is, but is trying to look on the bright side. “As I look at charts of various stock market averages, I get a very mixed picture,” he writes. “In conclusion, the trend evidence is mixed, but along with the recent oversold...our tape indicators still lean bullish.”
