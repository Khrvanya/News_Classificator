Mumbai: The SGX Nifty indicates a positive start this morning as the equity markets grapple with a powerful US handover last evening. US indices rallied on record job creation data that came through for June. It is likely that our market will follow suit, ignoring the still climbing rate of cases and lack of economic activity. The June quarter was one of the best in history for domestic equities, seems like July is also off to a firm start.
Stocks rose on Thursday following a better-than-expected US jobs report. The govt reported that a record 4.8 million jobs were created in June whereas Economists were expecting 2.9 million jobs to be created. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May whereas Economists were expecting a rate of 12.4%. Investors are now gathering more data points that could justify this otherwise mystical rally that has humbled the greatest, biggest and most experienced investors.

On the back of this huge beat, The Dow closed 92.39 points higher, or 0.4%, at 25,827.36. The Nasdaq Composite hit a record high, climbing 0.5% to 10,207.63. The S&P 500 also gained 0.5% to end the day at 3,130.01. Boeing contributed to the gains, rising 0.6%. The airplane maker completed recertification flights for its grounded 737 Max jet
Stocks in the Asia Pacific rose in Friday morning trade. US non-farm payrolls released overnight beat expectations hollow, raising optimism of a V shape recovery which caused the markets to rally. This came as an addition to the recent PMI data from China which was also ahead of expectations and rather encouraging. In Japan, both the Nikkei 225 and Topix indexes rose 0.55% in early trade. South Korea’s Kospi also advanced 0.46%. The Australian S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.33%. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index traded 0.13% higher
The Stoxx 600 provisionally closed about 1.9% higher on the back of the positive job data coming out of the US. Banks jumped the most here as much as  4.5% to lead gains. Most sectors and major bourses remained in positive territory.
OIL - Oil jumps 2% on US job data, posts second weekly gain in three
Demand projections saw a huge surge after the US reported a much larger increase in job data than was anticipated. This fuelled the case for a V shape recovery and an improved outlook for forward prices significantly. Brent crude futures gained $1.11, or 2.64% and eventually settled at $43.14 per barrel post rising 1.8% in the previous session. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 83 cents, or 2.08% and eventually settled at $40.65 per barrel, adding to a 1.4% rise on Wednesday. US crude inventories fell 7.2 million barrels from a record high last week, far more than analysts had expected.
Gold reversed course and edged higher on Thursday as the dollar eased contrary to what many would expect. The metal traded below an eight-year peak hit in the last session. Prospects for economic recovery accelerated after data showed the US economy created record jobs in June. However, much to everyone’s surprise Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,775.66 per ounce. US gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,787.50 per ounce. The movement can be attributed to volatility in equity markets and the belief that greater turmoil still lies ahead for financials.
