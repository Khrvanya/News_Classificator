Macquarie Research says gold and copper miner Aurelia metals has some 36 per cent upside over the next 12 months if its analysis is on the money.
Macquarie said the US dollar gold price could reach $2000 in Q1FY21.
The broker has lifted its financial 2020 earnings per share forecast 42 per cent to 5.3 cents on the back of a strong June quarter production update.
"Importantly, gold production has been particularly strong with 32.8koz produced, a doubling of the 16.3koz reported as at May 31 and more than double the March quarter production. We note gold production is 8koz ahead of the 24koz we were forecasting," wrote the broker.
As at the end of June Aurelia had $78.6 million cash on hand.
Macquarie has an outperform rating with a 12-month price target of 70 cents per share.
Yesterday the investment bank told clients the US dollar gold price could reach $2000 in the first quarter of financial 2021.
The rebound in retail sales in May was revised up to 16.9 per cent seasonally adjusted, solidifying the jump in trade for the month as the largest on record.
The result is 0.6 per cent above the preliminary figures for May released two weeks ago and follows the record 17.7 per cent drop in April.
But economists warn that the record month-on-month rise off the back of looser restrictions and government stimulus is unlikely to be repeated.
"The exceptional rebound in May is not likely to be repeated in June," said BIS Oxford chief economist Sarah Hunter.
"Although restrictions have been relaxed further in recent weeks, these changes have focused much more on services that fall outside of retail; with these activities able to (at least partially) resume, there could be a pullback in retail turnover as households move back towards more typical spending patterns."
The unwinding of government support is the key risk facing retailers moving forward, Dr Hunter added, which could trigger a pull back in spending.
