The Nasdaq just closed at 9,000 for the first time,  but index’s biggest winners aren’t the usual tech suspects
One of the U.S. stock markets best-performing indexes reached a new psychologically significant mark on Thursday, as the major indexes head to year end with the best gains in years.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP,
, closed at 9,000 for the first time ever Thursday, finishing above 9,022.
Its recent climb largely reflects gains for growth stocks, including Microsoft MSFT,
, which have helped to buoy the broader market also.
The Nasdaq climbed to 8,000 at the close on Aug. 27, 2018 and gains from some of the tech behemoths have helped the index to generate a return of about 36% so far this year.
Shares of Microsoft have gained more than 44.8% since August of 2018, while those for Apple have gained 33% over the same period.
It took 335 trading days to traverse 1,000 points for the index.
However, the Nasdaq’s rally also benefited from a number of stocks that aren’t always associated with the stock benchmark’s outperformance.
