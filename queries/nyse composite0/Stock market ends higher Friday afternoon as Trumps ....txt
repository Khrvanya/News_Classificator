The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pared losses and closed positive Friday afternoon after President Donald Trump took a number of measures in what he described as China violations, but fell short of taking any actions that might be perceived by investors as market negative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA,
advanced 1.3% to around 9.490. In a news conference in the White House's Rose Garden on Friday, Trump accused China of "continually" violating its "promises to us," but he did not mention ending a phase-one trade agreement or sanctioning China more directly in his comments. The president said he would Trump terminate the U.S.'s relationship with the World Health Organization, which he accuses of being heavily influenced by China. The president has continually blamed China's "malfeasance" for the spread of the novel strain of coronavirus associated with COVID-19.
Yes, this is another buy-the-dip call, but with more details.
