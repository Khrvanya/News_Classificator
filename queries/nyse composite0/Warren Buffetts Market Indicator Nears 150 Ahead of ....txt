Despite the early surge, gains were capped as coronavirus cases in the U.S. continue setting new records daily. According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the U.S. reported on Wednesday over 50,600 new cases, a new one-day record. Nonetheless, CNBC reported that economist Christian Scherrmann said the job reports in May and June offer "a blueprint for a fast recovery, but only once the virus situation is under control."
U.S. markets ended the second quarter with historic rallies: The 30-stock index soared 17.8%, the largest one-quarter rally since the first quarter of 1987's rally of over 21%. Likewise, the Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 10,000 for the first time in history on June 10, skyrocketed 30.6% in its largest quarterly rally since 1999.
Buffett said that the ratio of total market cap to gross domestic product is "probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment." The following video discusses the ratio and its applications to implied market returns.
As mentioned in the video, GuruFocus updated the calculation of the implied market returns in late June. The base-case implied market return now considers a reversion to the 20-year mean total market cap to gross domestic ratio instead of a fixed ratio of 80%. Based on this new calculation, the implied market return over the next eight years is 0.6% per year.
We also consider two scenarios: an optimistic case assuming a reversion to a market level at 130% of the 20-year-mean ratio and a pessimistic case assuming a reversion to a market level at 70% of the 20-year-mean ratio. Based on the current market valuation level, the implied market return ranges from -3.70% per year at the pessimistic case to 3.70% per year at the optimistic case.
