The Dow gained 477.37 points, or 1.90, to close at 25,605.54. The S&P 500 climbed 1.31% to 3,041.31. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.01% to 9,588.81. Stocks were volatile as they struggled to regain their footing on Friday following their biggest sell-off in three months during the previous session.
The major averages posted their first weekly declines in four as rising concerns over a possible coronavirus resurgence spooked the recently soaring market. The Dow ended the week down 5.55% while the S&P 500 dropped 4.78%. The Nasdaq posted a weekly loss of 2.30%. Those losses marked Wall Street's worst one-week performance since March 20, when they all plunged at least 12%. "We had gone straight up more than 30% without a real sell-off, so you're due for one, and I don't think it's the worst thing in the world," says one trader. "As more states get back, the question becomes: Are they going to ramp up fast enough to please Wall Street? What you're seeing is it'll be hard to do that."
