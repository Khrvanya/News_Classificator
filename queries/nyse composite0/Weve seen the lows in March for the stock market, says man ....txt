‘We’ve seen the lows in March’ for the stock market, says man who called Dow 20,000 in 2015, ‘and we will never see those lows again
Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E. Palmer professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
That is Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, during CNBC’s “Squawk Box” segment on Friday, expressing nearly unfettered optimism about the path forward for the U.S. stock market, despite a historically bad jobs report.
Friday’s monthly report on the employment situation in the U.S. showed that 20.5 million jobs were eliminated last month, and the unemployment rate rocketed to 14.7% from a 50-year low of 3.5% two months ago, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses across the country. However, dramatic as it was, the headline number was less alarming than estimates calling for 22 million unemployed.
Although the government didn’t keep records back then, economic historians estimate unemployment peaked at 25% in 1933.
Still, according to Siegel, unprecedented support for the economy by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government make it nearly impossible for the stock market to revert to its late March lows.
