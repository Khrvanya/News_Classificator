Earlier this week, Disney's former chief executive officer Mr. Bob Iger announced his resignation, in a move that surprised industry watchers and the press alike. Mr. Iger's been a key part of the way in which Disney views itself as a modern company. His acquisitions and deals in the entertainment sector have provided the company with a platform set to dominate the entertainment industry, whether it's in the cinema or on the internet.
Prior to the news of his departure being made public, The Walt Disney Company lost 3.7% during the day's trading on Tuesday, while the New York Stock Exchange lost 2.88% in value as a whole. In after-hours trading and before yesterday's opening, Disney's market value dropped by as much as $3.6 billion as the company started to flirt with one-year low closing prices. Now that Wednesday's trading is done with and Disney enters a new day on the market, the company has effectively lost all value that it gained on the open market following the launch of Disney+ late last year.

Additionally, and by taking a brief look at Disney's operations, it's clear that Coronvarius too is factored in the company's latest market value drop. In its latest earnings call, Disney joined the list of big-name companies to confirm that the 2019-COVID will cause it to report lower earnings in its second quarter of and full-year 2020 since the outbreak is taking place at a time when attendance in the company's theme parks is high due to the Chinese New Year.

As Disney heads into its six consecutive daily drops in share price, it's clear that the past 20 days have seen more drops than gains. For the dividend happy investor, however, the stock continues to be an attractive offering based on stable payouts over the past ten years. Disney's dividends have grown by roughly 17% per year for the last ten years, and given the company's size and scope of operations, it nevertheless looks to remain a safe investment (conduct your own due diligence prior to making any investment decisions).
In its latest fiscal quarter, The Walt Disney Company earned $2 billion in net income, marking for a 23% year-over-year drop, even though its revenues grew over the same time period by 36% to $21 billion. The revenue growth was fuelled by Disney's media networks as the segment posted $7.3 billion in revenue, up by 24% from the year-ago quarter.
