Total retail sales grew 3.4% in the holiday season, further supporting strong spending trends and economic optimism among consumers.
Equity indexes weren't the only vehicles to soar in Thursday trading.

The S&P 500 is now on track for a 29% gain year to date, less than 1 percentage point from notching its best performance since 1997.
