Prep time: 5 minutes | Cooking time: 20 minutes
Leaves from a bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
For the salad, rinse the potatoes and boil them in lightly salted water until tender, but not soft and overcooked. Drain and let them cool a little. Halve and place them in a large bowl with the parsley and chives.
In a small bowl for the vinaigrette, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, honey, salt and pepper, then gradually whisk in the olive oil in a steady stream until the vinaigrette is thickened. Taste for seasoning. Pour the vinaigrette over the potatoes and mix gently.
Before serving, place the potato salad on a large serving plate and sprinkle with edible flowers.
