My name is ADDIE. I am a spayed female, red and white Pit Bull Terrier mix. The shelter staff think I am about 1 year and 7 months old. I have been at the shelter since May 25, 2020.
Shelter Staff made the following comments about this animal:
Miss Addie is about a year and a half old, weighs 80 pounds, and would love to be your best friend! When outside she likes to explore everywhere and enjoys chasing tennis balls. Once inside she’ll cuddle up next to you on a blanket, nudging her head into you for pets. She is sweet girl who would do best in a loving home without cats.
