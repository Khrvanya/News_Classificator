If you're going hard at the gym in preparation for the beach this summer then make sure you've got the right kit.
Leggings, tanks, shorts, a supportive sports bra; these are all essentials when dressing specifically to work up a sweat. But one of the most important things is to get the right pair of trainers for your work out.
It's often a good idea to go to a specialist shop where they can watch your gait and suggest the perfect trainer for your particular feet, but if you haven't got time for that then of course you can always invest in some pro running shoes online.
Lily-Rose Depp is a fitness guru so you know she knows the brands to go for and she's a fan of these 'Air Max BW GS' sneakers in a gorgeous white blue mix.
