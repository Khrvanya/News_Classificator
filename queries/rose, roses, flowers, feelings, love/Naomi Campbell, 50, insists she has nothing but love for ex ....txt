Naomi Campbell has rubbished suggestions she's no longer on speaking terms with her ex boyfriend Skepta.
The supermodel, 50, was romantically linked with the Grime artist, 37, in 2018, though they never publicly confirmed their relationship.
After she made comments about an acrimonious break up with her last beau, fans were quick to claim she was talking about Skepta, which she has since disputed.
In an Instagram post on Monday, the Vogue cover star shared snaps of herself cosying up to the rapper, as she penned: 'STOP. All love between Us @skeptagram'.
Speaking to Times Weekend magazine, Naomi said that she is on good terms with all her previous ex-boyfriends, but admitted she isn't friends with her 'last' ex.
