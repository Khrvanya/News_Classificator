The vehicle was flagged for subsequent action, Bramson said.
Two uniformed police officers stopped the car Friday at 10:54 p.m. in the area of Potter Avenue and Pierce Street. Police said the driver had committed several traffic infractions, but did not specify them.
Flowers, a passenger in the car, immediately exited the vehicle after it stopped and fled on foot, a police statement said.
The officer pursuing Flowers became aware he had a gun, according to Bramson, who did not specify how. The officer used a Taser, but it was ineffective, the mayor said.
According to the police statement, a struggle ensued and Flowers showed a handgun, pointed it at an officer and attempted to fire.
Police said a Ruger 9mm handgun, magazine and rounds were recovered from the scene.
Subsequently, the officer fired six shots, the mayor said. One of the shots hit Flowers through the armpit and penetrated his heart.
The police statement said the officers gave medical assistance to Flowers. Flowers was taken immediately to Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital, where he arrived at 11:10 p.m. on Friday. He had already been intubated, had no pulse and was declared dead at 11:24 p.m., the mayor said.
The police are seeking the vehicle involved, a 2019 black Dodge sedan registered in Virgina. The driver of the car left the scene and has yet to be found, Bramson said.
The state Attorney General's Office said it would not investigate the case.
