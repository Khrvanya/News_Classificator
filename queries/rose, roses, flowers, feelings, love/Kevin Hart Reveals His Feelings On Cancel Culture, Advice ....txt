Kevin Hart knows he's made some mistakes in his past, but like many controversies these days, a resurfaced tweet was involved in one of his most memorable snafus. Hart ended up stepping down from hosting the Oscars in 2018, which he had been scheduled to headline, when the homophobic tweets in question ran around. Now, he’s speaking out about his feelings regarding the Internet and cancel culture in general.
To be clear, Kevin Hart isn’t saying the joke that resurfaced back in 2018 was appropriate, but he does have some feelings about cancel culture in general and the level of scrutiny and moral expectations laid on celebrity shoulders. He even has some advice to those on social media who have or have been a part of cancel culture. Let’s break it down. First of all, Hart says no one is perfect, noting,
I think that right now you gotta get to a point where you just become more realistic, right? What I mean by being realistic is nobody is perfect, nobody is going to be. This whole idea of a cancel culture means that you’re living in a time where you’re just expecting perfection as if people don’t slip and fall down the steps.
Speaking to Oprah’s O Magazine , Kevin Hart talked for a while about not knowing any better when he was a young man and making ill-advised jokes online. His story is similar to James Gunn’s, who also made some jokes online prior to becoming famous for Guardians of the Galaxy and its subsequent sequels; in his case, old tweets also later resurfaced. While Hart also mentions that sometimes behavior online can be abhorrent and sometimes there needs to be ramifications , he also believes there are a lot of grey areas and teachable moments than many people on the Internet are willing to have patience for.
