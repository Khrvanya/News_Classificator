“Just living is not enough … one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.” — Hans Christian Andersen
The gracious ladies of the Power of Flowers Project hosted their annual sold-out luncheon at Tewksbury Country Club on Oct. 16.
More than 300 gals (and more than a few good men) enjoyed an elegant luncheon in the beautiful room, as well as a silent auction and raffles.?Everyone even received a favor of a dainty POFP bouquet.
Powers of Flowers Project’s motto is “Sharing Hope and Happiness,” and it delivers hundreds of individual bouquets to members of the community each week. POFP reuses floral arrangements from funerals, weddings and other events to make something beautiful and to share hope and happiness to children’s hospitals, hospices and so many other organizations.
