Black Lives Matter supporters placed flowers at Truro War Memorial on Sunday morning in a bid to seek unity following a skirmish between two groups earlier this week.
A group of ex-Armed Forces and veterans, who said they were protecting the war memorial on Boscawen Street in a non-violent way, and a section of people who had taken part in a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest, were kept apart by police and arrests were made on Monday, June 15.
The BLM protesters said it had never been their intention to harm the memorial, while the ex-Armed Forces group said they were there to protect the 98-year-old statue just in case it was vandalised.
Black Lives Matter supporters arrived at the memorial at 11am on Sunday.
Bystanders looked on and applauded as people in pairs paid their respects to the fallen.
One man, who was part of the group protecting the memorial last week, said: “We weren’t here on Monday as a counter protest, that’s something I want to make very clear.
"We were down here purely to protect our monument, a lot of locals have got relatives who are on that board.
“There are a lot of names on there, including people of different ethnic backgrounds. The behaviour exhibited on Monday demonstrated as to why we were here. It was a horrible atmosphere.
