Derrick Rose dissed in list of NBA's best No. 1 picks since 2000
Bleacher Report caused quite a stir on Twitter Monday morning when they snubbed Derrick Rose with a list of the supposed best No. 1 picks since 2000.
The Top-10 list has Rose behind guys like Karl-Anthony-Towns, Blake Griffin and Anthony Davis.

Never mind that D-Rose is the only guy besides LeBron to win MVP on the list. Never mind that D-Rose is the youngest ever to win the award. Never mind that D-Rose has battled back from countless injuries for a renaissance season in Detroit, averaging 18.1 points and 5.6 assists in 26 minutes per game.
Upon further review, it seems Bleacher Report didn't mind several things when putting their list together.
Luckily the good people of Twitter came to Rose's defense.
