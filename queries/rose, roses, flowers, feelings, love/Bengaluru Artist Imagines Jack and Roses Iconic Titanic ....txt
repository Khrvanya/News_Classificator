The art shows Rose played by Kate Winslet striking the signature posture with a face mask. While Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack too dons a face mask and unlike in the movie is standing far behind his lady love.
That Titanic pose, where Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater stand together on the ship railing, spreading their arms and embracing the freedom has graced the walls of Bengaluru.
The pose, an expression of love, however, was given a twist keeping COVID-19 times in mind - complete with social distancing and facemask protection.
An artist in Bengaluru painted the iconic pose on a wall. This one, with all the dreams and hopes of being romantic, also comes with a practical approach due to the COVID-19 times. The mural is by famous artist Baadal Nanjundaswamy.
