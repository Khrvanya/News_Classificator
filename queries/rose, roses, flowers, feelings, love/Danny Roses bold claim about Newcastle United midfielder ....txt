Danny Rose says that Jonjo Shelvey's decision to spend his peak years at Newcastle United is great news for the club's fan-base.
Shelvey, now 28, has extended his deal at Newcastle to remain on Tyneside until 2023 to end speculation he will end his top-flight career in his native capital.
Shelvey had been linked with West Ham United in the last three windows but has now penned a deal that Steve Bruce hopes will bring out the best in him.
Rose, who played with Shelvey for England under Roy Hodgson, said: "Jonjo for me is the type of player, when on his game, that I would pay to watch.
"He's absolutely brilliant in that central position.
"The way he dictates the game and his range of passing is the best in the Premier League.
"I played with him for England.
"I am so fortunate to play with him again now at Newcastle.
Shelvey put in a strong performance at Southampton 10 days ago before the Premier League was suspended due to the virus pandemic.
Rose said: "When he is playing in that deep lying role and dictating play, there's nobody that touches him in this league for me.
After both Shelvey and Matt Ritchie extended their deals, Bruce said recently: "They've been very, very good for Newcastle over the last few years and I've been lucky enough to inherit the two of them, so thankfully there's been a really good conclusion.
"They've both been here about four years now and a big make-up of the team has been those two. We all know what Ritchie's like, the way he is - there's never a dull day - and Jonjo, we all know he's a very, very talented footballer, so I'm delighted that they've committed their future."
