Dr. Pimple Popper started off her week by popping a cyst in a patient's armit.
She compared the cyst to a rose as she was talking to the patient.
This isn't the first time dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, has removed an armpit cyst.
Dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper , is starting a fresh week out with another super satisfying extraction video of an epidermoid cyst in her patient's armpit.
She's worked on many armpits before, previously removing another armpit cyst (with a punch biopsy ), an armpit pilar cyst and an armpit steatocystoma .
"Epidermoid cyst under the armpit! ðŸ‘€ #drpimplepopper #cyst ," she captioned the video.
The video begins with Dr. P zoomed in on her patient's armpit, where the epidermoid cyst has been sliced open to start the removal.
"Sometimes the cyst contents are a little darker because of our pigment. So I'm just squeezing it," she says as she uses her fingers to start squeezing out the cyst, which looks gray and light brown in some parts. "You have a little cyst rose right here!" she says, referring to the shape of the gunk that's coming out of the cyst.
She goes on to joke with her patient as she continues to dig into the cyst with a pair of tweezers and scissors that it would feel a lot more weird if the cyst were on her skull.
"It's good I'm not working on your head. I'm a little sick that way, sometimes I work with someone's head and I knock on it, like 'Oh I'm knocking on your skull!'" she laughs as she cuts out the cyst. "I'm just trying to trim off the little sac contents here. There's a little attachment there."
