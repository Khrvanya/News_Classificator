The Rose Ladies Series, sponsored by Justin Rose and wife Kate, kicked off at Brokenhurst Manor last week. England's Charley Hull secured the first event with a play-off victory over Liz Young. Take a look insider her winning bag.
DRIVER: TaylorMade SIM with 10.5˚ loft, fitted with Attas Rockstar 6X shaft.
3-WOOD: TaylorMade SIM Max with 15˚ loft, with Mitsubishi Chemical Tensei Blue 70 S shaft.
HYBRID: TaylorMade SIM Max Rescue with 19˚ loft, with UST iROD 85 S shaft.
IRONS: TaylorMade P-730 (4-iron to pitching wedge), with Nippon Modus 125 S shafts.
WEDGES: TaylorMade Milled Grind 2 (50˚, 54˚ & 60˚), with Nippon Modus 120 S shafts.
Making her first start since January's Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rio, Hull managed an even par round of 70 at Brokenhurst manor in the debut of the Rose Ladies Series, an eight event circuit, before defeating Young in sudden-death. Like many of her compeitors, Hull has spent time testing equipment during the layoff from tournament golf, the 24-year-old's win coming in her first start using TaylorMade's SIM driver and TP5 golf ball.
A former winner on the LPGA Tour, Hull is in the minority of ladies Tour players to use blade irons, the two-time LET winner opting for the same P-730 model as Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson, among others.
Hull's recent switch to the five-piece TP5 golf ball when combined with her new SIM driver resulted in a 2-3 MPH increase in ball speed for the already powerful player. Hull gaining around half a club in distance throughout her bag.
