Just days after the season finale, it was revealed that Batwoman star Ruby Rose departed the Arrowverse show. It was then confirmed that the role of Kate Kane won’t be recast, but instead, a new character will be introduced to take on the mantle. For now, it’s unclear who this character will fit into the narrative, but fans of the show noticed that this route could create a Crisis on Infinite Earths plothole.
As pointed out by Redditor Funbun71 , LaMonica Garrett’s The Monitor had a dialogue, saying that Kate Kane is the “Bat of the Future.” She is also considered as the Paragon of Courage, making her one of the few heroes in the multiverse who has the power to stop Anti-Monitor.
The title clearly sets up a prominent role for Batwoman in the Arrowverse. However, this won’t be the case with a new hero gearing up to take on the mantle for the second season of the show.
Batwoman showrunner Caroline Dries has already revealed that Kate Kane won’t be killed off , but it’ll be interesting to see how the show will incorporate this into the plot and whether or not they plan on “fixing” this Crisis plothole.
Batwoman Season 2 is currently set for release in 2021 on The CW.
