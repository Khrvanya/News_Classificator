ESPN Fantasy Projection: Love is expected to make his NFL debut this season after missing his entire rookie season because of a torn ACL suffered while at Stanford. Love had the look of an emerging superstar after he broke out for 2,118 rushing yards (8.1 YPC) and 19 touchdowns in 2017. The wheels fell off from there, as his 2018 season began with a drop in production and ended with the knee injury. Love is undersized (5-foot-9, 200 pounds), but he sports good speed, elusiveness and tackle-breaking ability. He has big upside if able to return to 2017 form, but it might take some time for him to see the field with Derrius Guice, Antonio Gibson, Adrian Peterson, J.D. McKissic and Peyton Barber in the mix in Washington. Take a late flier on Love in very deep and dynasty leagues.
