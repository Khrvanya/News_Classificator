The summer solstice, also known as midsummer, is among the earliest of the 24 solar terms to be defined. As early as the 7th century B.C., the ancients determined the date of the summer solstice – June 21 – when they measured the sun's shadow.
Most parts of China will now enter midsummer. At this time, everything is flourishing and the shade is thickening and bringing a bit of coolness to this hot season.
