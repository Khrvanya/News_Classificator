The Last Of Us Part 2: What’s The Problem Here, Exactly?
“To be honest with you, I did consider the ‘soap opera version’ [of recasting] for a hot minute, because selfishly we already had a couple episodes written, and transition-wise it would be seamless,” she told Plec. “But upon further reflection — and I think [Arrowverse EP] Greg [Berlanti] helped me make this call — he’s like, ‘I think we should just reboot Batwoman as a different character.'”
Dries says that this is also in part to pay “respect to everything that Ruby [Rose] put into the Kate Kane character” and “it also helps the audience, because we’re not asking them to address ‘the elephant in the room.'”
It’s a complicated situation, and while it would have been difficult to explain a new face for Kate Kane in season 2, I feel like it may be even more challenging to recast her completlye with a new lead character, given that Kane will have to have some reason given why she’s disappeared, either killed off offscreen or gone on vacation to meet up with Bruce Wayne. Either way, it’s going to be a little awkward.
This explanation does seem to reinforce the idea that there does not appear to be any animosity between Rose and Dries, even though her departure puts the team in a difficult spot, and I imagine it’s not fun to rewrite a bunch of episodes you already had done.
Frankly, I do think this change will end up being good for the show, because I just was never a huge fan of Rose’s Kane in particular. I actually appreciate the idea of going to a character with wildly different energy for the new Batwoman, even if we’re cutting against the comics and going into entirely original territory here. I think it could work.
We still don’t know who will be cast as “Ryan Wilder” yet, only that it will be another LGBTQ actress (as the character will remain a lesbian even with Kane gone). Expect that announcement soon.
