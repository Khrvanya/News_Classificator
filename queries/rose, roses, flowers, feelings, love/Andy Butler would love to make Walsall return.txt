Former Walsall captain Andy Butler is determined to prolong his playing career and insists he would ‘love’ a return to the Saddlers.
The 36-year-old was released by League Two rivals Scunthorpe in May after 21 appearances last season.
The defender is the current manager of Doncaster Rovers Belles but he claims his playing days are not behind him.
“I feel as fit as I’ve ever felt,” he said.
“This season wasn’t a good one for me, for whatever reason it never really clicked for me, and it’s disappointing. But I still feel like I have a lot to offer a team and I don’t feel like I’m old. I love playing football, it’s something I’ve always done, and I want to be the one that says my time is up, I don’t want someone else telling me.
“I have to find a club, if someone wants me, and I’ll see if it’s right for me. I can still do a job for a team. I’d love to come back (to Walsall), at some stage, you never know what happens in the future.
“If Walsall came and offered me something, and I’m not saying they will, it’s something I would have to look at seriously.”
