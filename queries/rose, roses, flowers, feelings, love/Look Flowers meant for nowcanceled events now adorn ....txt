CLEVELAND â€” Spring is officially here, but the spirits of some have been dampened by the global coronavirus pandemic. One local florist is working to change that.
Andrew Thomas Design spent the last few days decorating the famous "Cleveland" signs near Edgewater and Tremont with dozens of beautiful flowers. The flowers were seemingly meant to be used for local weddings and other events, but with so many having been canceled or postponed lately to encourage social distancing, they are now being used as a symbol of hope for the community.
"Regardless of our current situations, the good outweighs the bad," Thomas wrote on social media, also thanking those who donated flowers. "And this is just a little taste of that."
The most recent arrangement at Edgewater will be taken down by Sunday, so there's still time to check it out (at a safe distance from others, of course). We hope to see more of these popping up, however!
