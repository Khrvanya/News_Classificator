Knowing which planting zone you live in goes a long way toward maintaining a successful, long-lasting garden based on your location's climate and environment.
If you’ve ever planted a spring garden and faced the frustration of having your hard work not pay you back with beautiful flowers, the reason could very well be that you didn’t choose the type of flowers that thrive in your climate . Follow a few basic tips and watch your garden grow.
