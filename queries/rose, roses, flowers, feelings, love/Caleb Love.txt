At nearly 6-foot-3 with pretty good length, Love can play either guard spot and shows significant potential on the defensive end. A score-first point guard, he has the ability to put his team on his back as a bucket getter, or to be a facilitator. Right now, he is more comfortable taking shots than setting up teammates, but his passing has improved and he is doing a better job of running a team.  Ultimately, it comes down to Loveâ€™s ability to run a team at the college level and beyond, but there is no doubt he can score. The requisite athleticism is absolutely there.
