The 31-year-old dancer recently announced her split from husband Brooks Laich after almost three years of marriage.
While Hough and Laich, 36, have appeared to remain cordial post-breakup , it's been a rough go for the "Rock of Ages" star, according to a new report.

Hough's hair has undergone a few changes in recent weeks, as she debuted a pink 'do in late May and now her new brunette look, which was first seen on Instagram last week.
Reps for Hough did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Hough and LaichÂ announced their split in a joint statement to People magazine last month.
"We have lovingly and carefully taken the time we have needed to arrive at our decision to separate," they said. "We share an abundance of love and respect for one another and will continue to lead with our hearts from that place. We kindly request your compassion and respect for our privacy moving forward."
