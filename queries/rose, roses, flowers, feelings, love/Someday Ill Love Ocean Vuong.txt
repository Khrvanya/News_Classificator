Save this story for later.
it is already behind us.
until one of you forgets. Like how the spine
whittled down to a single red tripwire.
& you’ll never reach it.
just after the lights go out, when you can still see
the faint torch between his legs.
to find your own hands.
& are given a mouth to empty into.
trying to live a little longer. Ocean. Ocean,
the room with everyone in it.
