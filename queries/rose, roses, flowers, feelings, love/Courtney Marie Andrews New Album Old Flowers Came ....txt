There are a lot of heartbreak albums out there. Heartbreak is maybe the biggest and most enduring inspiration when it comes to songwriting, but it's rare to hear heartbreak dealt with as much nuance as Courtney Marie Andrews gives it. The Nashville-based, Phoenix-born singer-songwriter spent a large part of the past nine years — almost her entire 20s — in a relationship, and when that relationship ended, she came out as a different person. But instead of looking back with resentment or anger, Courtney Marie Andrews looks back on what she lost with love.
On her upcoming album, Old Flowers, out July 24, she preserves the memories of those formative years, as well as the emotions that come with loss. It's not unlike the way you might preserve old flowers by pressing them in a book. These moments, this person you were, that relationship you had: These flowers are gone, but you can still appreciate just how beautiful they were when they were in full bloom. Today, Courtney Marie Andrews talks about Old Flowers and plays songs from the album, beginning with "How You Get Hurt."
