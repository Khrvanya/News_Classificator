Since becoming the No. 1 overall pick by his hometown Chicago Bulls in 2008, Derrick Rose has had his fair share of spectacular games. After all, you don’t become the youngest MVP in NBA history without putting on a show for an entire 82-game season.
In 596 career games with the Bulls, New York Knicks , Cleveland Cavaliers , Minnesota Timberwolves and Detroit Pistons , Rose has averages of 18.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.6 assists. He’s racked up a total of 11,185 points, 2,031 rebounds and 3,334 assists.
From the day he made his NBA debut in 2008 to the last game he played for the Pistons this season prior to play getting suspended, Rose has always gotten the fan’s attention at the stadium and on TV with his elite speed and finishing ability.
The three-time All-Star and former Rookie of the Year has put up some intriguing stat lines throughout his career, some of them great, others not so much.
For this piece, we’ll take a look at some of the most noteworthy stat lines Derrick Rose has registered during his NBA career.
Derrick Rose and the Bulls were facing the Celtics in the first round of the 2009 playoffs. Boston, the reigning NBA champions, were the heavy favorites to win Game 1 and the overall series.
However, the oddsmakers didn’t take into account for Derrick Rose. The Chicago native led the Bulls to a huge Game 1 victory with 36 points and 11 assists.
Rose tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA record for points scored by a rookie in his playoff debut.
During his MVP season when he averaged 25.0 points, 4.1 rebounds and 7.7 assists, Rose scored 42 points against the Spurs without hitting a single 3-pointer.
This era of basketball wasn’t the 3-point heavy era we have today, but it’s still impressive that Rose was able to score that many points against a stingy Spurs defense without making even one shot from deep.
The Bulls won behind Rose’s 42 points. He shot 18-of-28 from the field, 6-of-6 from the free-throw line and also dished out eight assists.
Surprisingly, this is Derrick Rose’s only triple-double of his NBA career. It’s fitting, though, that he did it during his MVP season and in Memphis, where he played his college ball.
Against the Grizzlies on Jan. 17, 2011, Rose led the Bulls to a 12-point win. He only shot 7-of-20 from the floor, but his overall game helped Chicago snag the win.
Game 3 of 2011 Eastern Conference Semifinals vs. Hawks
With the series tied at 1-1, Derrick Rose basically told the Hawks enough was enough in Game 3 at their house.
The MVP scored a playoff career-high 44 points to help the Bulls take a 2-1 series lead. He also had seven assists and five rebounds.
Rose shot 16-of-27 from the field and 4-of-7 from 3.
This is one of the weirdest and flat out ugliest games Derrick Rose has ever played, but he ended it the right way.
Against Stephen Curry and the high powered Warriors, the Bulls were going to need Rose to be in attack mode all game, especially since Jimmy Butler wasn’t playing due to injury.
While Rose was aggressive, he was out of control. He shot 13-of-33 from the floor and had 11 turnovers.
Somehow, Rose was a +10 in the game, mostly because without his scoring, the Bulls weren’t competing against the Dubs.
Rose’s 13th field goal turned out to be the game-winner. The Bulls star hit the shot right in the grill of Klay Thompson.
Since becoming the youngest MVP in NBA history back in 2011, Derrick Rose has undergone four knee surgeries. During the 2017-18 season, he was traded by the Cavs to the Utah Jazz . The Jazz then waived Rose and suddenly it looked like his NBA career was over.
However, Timberwolves head coach Tom Thibodeau — who coached Rose in Chicago — signed Derrick in March of 2018. Rose averaged 14.2 points and 2.6 assists for the Timberwolves in the 2018 playoffs while shooting a ridiculous 70.0 percent from 3. His NBA career was saved.
During the 2018-19 season, Derrick Rose did something very special. He scored 50 points against the Jazz, the team which waived him. Derrick cried during his postgame interview because he knew how much hard work he put into his craft to get to this point. The entire NBA community was very happy for Rose and showered him with love.
Rose shot 19-of-31 from the floor. It was another old school game from D-Rose. He made only four shots from beyond the arc.
Rose finished the 2018-19 season with averages of 18.0 points and 4.3 assists. He was the best player for the Pistons this season prior to play getting suspended due to COVID-19.
Rose was putting up 18.1 points and 5.6 assists for Detroit.
