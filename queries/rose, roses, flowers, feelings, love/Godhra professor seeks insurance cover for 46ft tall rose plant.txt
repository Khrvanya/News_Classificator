Prof Arunsinh Solanki, who teaches accountancy in Godhra, wants insurance cover for his rose plant. The rose plant in his compound stands tall at 46 feet and growing. The rose plant was included in the record book as the tallest rose plant in the country. “I bought the sapling from a street vendor who visits our society regularly in 2006 to mark my marriage anniversary. I took great of it since day one, watering it every morning without fail,” said the professor. He had already contacted a nationalized general insurance company for insurance of the plant. “They have said that they will contact their higher-ups and get back to me,” said Solanki. He is also planning to seek entry in the Guinness Book of World Records too.
