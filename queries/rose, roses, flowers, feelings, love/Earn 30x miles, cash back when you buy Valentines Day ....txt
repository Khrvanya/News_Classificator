Personally, I’ve had the best success ordering from The Bouqs, which unfortunately doesn’t partner with any of the above programs. You can often save a bundle by using Honey’s browser extension , though, and I did encounter a $20 back deal through Amex Offers, when paying with The Platinum Card® from American Express , which you may find sitting on your own account.
I also spotted an Amex Offer for 1,500 Membership Rewards points when spending at least $50 with 1-800-Flowers, worth $30, based on our valuations . There’s a good chance you’ll be able to stack that deal with one of the mileage promotions listed above, too.
Or, if cash back is more your speed, you may be able to get up to $12 back through Chase Offers, in addition to the mileage offers above.
Note that flower purchases don’t trigger common category bonuses, so you’ll most likely want to use a card that offers the best return for everyday spending, such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited or Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card , or our other top picks right here .
