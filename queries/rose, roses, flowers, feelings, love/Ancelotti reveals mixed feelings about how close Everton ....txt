Carlo Ancelotti praised his Everton side for how they defended against Liverpool, but admitted they had opportunities at the other end.
Everton restricted their rivals to a goalless draw upon their return to Premier League action . Liverpool may be closing in on the league title, but it was Everton who came closest to scoring, when there was a late double chance for Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Tom Davies.
And despite Ancelotti being a little disappointed at how close his side came to grabbing all three points, he was pleased with the level of their performance.
“Honestly we were really close to winning but it was a tough game, difficult game,” he said. “We performed really well.
“We were focused, we sacrificed. We had opportunities to score at the end.
“Liverpool played a good game, they had more possession but defensively we were really good.
“Offensively we tried to build from the back. They pressed really high and it was difficult to find a solution from the back so we decided to play more long ball.”
