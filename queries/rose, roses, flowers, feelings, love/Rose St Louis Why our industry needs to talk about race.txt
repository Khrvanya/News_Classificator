Our COVER Customer Care Awards return for 2020. Serving as a sister to October's industry-wide COVER Excellence...Awards, which focus mainly on product development and overall quality, the Customer Care Awards provide a chance to represent the ‘unsung' heroes working across our industry.
Join us at the COVER Claims & Underwriting Forum to explore how the protection and health sector can continue to...enhance industry practices to improve the customer experience, as insurers increasingly expand the care and support services available to policyholders before, during and after a claim. What is the future of life and health insurance? In a nutshell, it’s prevention, personalisation and innovation.
The COVER Excellence Awards celebrate the leading firms and intermediaries within the protection, life and health...insurance space.
Spanning advice firms and providers across 27 different categories this year, there are three new awards for 2020. The Best Business Protection award will shine a light on the most outstanding cover options for shareholders and key personnel, while Best Protection Platform is open to both insurers and third party administrators. Plus, the COVER Proud to Protect award, in association with Aviva, will celebrate the achievements of an adviser who has gone above and beyond for a client.
