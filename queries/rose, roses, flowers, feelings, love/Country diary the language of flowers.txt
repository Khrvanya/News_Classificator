Life is easier, a leisurely walk in the park, for the hoverflies, soldier beetles and a single wasp on the hogweed inflorescence nearby. Itâ€™s a compound umbel, a flat platform of clusters of small, white florets, supported by stems arranged like spokes of miniature umbrellas, each in turn supported by a spoke of a larger umbrella. Hoverflies land, unfold their tongues and wander over this floral plain, eating some pollen but dragging more over the receptive stigmas of the florets.
Arching overhead are flat, cream corymbs of elder blossom, some as large as tea plates, open tables for any passing insect. From below I can see that the florets have a different underpinning architecture. Each main supporting spoke rises from the same point but then sub-branches, each tipped with clusters of florets, become progressively shorter towards the top of the spoke. The result is another level floral playing field, another way of constructing an inflorescence and servicing insect visitors.
