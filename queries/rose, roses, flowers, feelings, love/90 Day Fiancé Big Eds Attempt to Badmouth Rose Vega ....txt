So, how did Ed’s attempt to badmouth his ex-fiance backfire in such a huge way?
Well, as it would turn out, fans didn’t exactly take his side. Quite a few people actually came to her defense , calling him out for how he treated her. Most people feel that the nasty attitude, and doing things such as calling her “gross,” and asking her to “shave her legs,” was simply unacceptable, and it is widely agreed that Vega just didn’t deserve that.
Secondly, by using her relationship with someone of the same gender, Brown was trying to humiliate Vega, and fortunately, it didn’t work. Fans were disappointed in the homophobic undertones of Big Ed’s accusations and that he would twist her arm into coming out. Rose ultimately admitted to being involved with a woman — after she broke up with Big Ed — and fans were not impressed by how Rose didn’t have control over when she came out to the world.
Lastly, Big Ed got slammed by the women of the TLC series. Darcey Silva openly called out Big Ed and offered her empathy to Rose. She told Big Ed women should be uplifted. Baby Girl Lisa even questioned Big Ed on whether he truly loved Rose and told him that no woman would tolerate his behavior. Avery chimed in to see he seemed inauthentic.
Former TLC stars have spoken out against Big Ed, reports ScreenRant . Tim Malcolm, for example, called Big Ed “delusional.”
Big Ed tried to contact her long after they called it quits on their relationship, but luckily, she stood her ground and made it clear that she was ready to move on. As for his attempts to drag Vega, fans, critics, and current and past TLC stars all sided with Vega.
