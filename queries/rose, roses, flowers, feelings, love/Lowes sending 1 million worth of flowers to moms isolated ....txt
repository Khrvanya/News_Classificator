Lowe’s Home Improvement is sending $1 million worth of flowers to mom’s who can’t be with their family this Mother’s Day because of the novel coronavirus.
The Mooresville-based company is donating flower baskets to more than 500 long-term care and senior living facilities across more than 12 markets impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including Charlotte, New York, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, Houston and Miami.
“We hope that these flower deliveries, made possible by our network of local nurseries will bring a spark of joy to the moms and grandmothers in senior housing who may feel alone this Mother’s Day,” said Marisa Thalberg, Lowe’s executive vice president, chief brand and marketing officer.
Metrolina Greenhouses in Huntersville was one of the providers of the flowers.
“We will send nearly 25,000 flowers to more than 70 local facilities this week, including one to a local housing facility where an associate from our South End store lives,” said Jackie Hartzell, Lowe’s spokeswoman. “Her store manager wanted to surprise her and her fellow residents, so we coordinated 300 plants to be dropped off and spread some cheer to her community.”
Uber drivers will deliver flowers in some of the markets, according to the company.
