The memory of those killed during the Great Patriotic War was honored with a moment of silence in Vitebsk. Flowers were laid at the military burial ground on the Assumption Hill. The territory of the memorial includes one mass and eleven solitary graves. Here lies the legendary Minay Shmyrev, one of the founders of the powerful partisan movement.
During the Great Patriotic War, Vitebsk was almost completely destroyed. At the time of liberation, there were practically no residents left in the city.
