There have been no updates regarding new music from the band — which Slash, 54, has confirmed is in the works on several occasions.
It’s been 12 years since GNR fans were treated to new tunes, and more than two and a half decades since they’ve heard material from the beloved classic lineup.
Select ticket presales — including an exclusive Nightrain fan club sale — begin Tuesday at 10 a.m. in each local time zone where the band will play.
All remaining tickets go on sale to the general public on Friday at the same time.
July 18 — East Rutherford, N.J. @ MetLife Stadium
July 29 — Commerce City, Colo. @ Dick’s Sporting Goods Park
