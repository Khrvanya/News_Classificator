Two families that have been doing business together since 1947 have a blooming new initiative to celebrate.
Rose-breeding business Matthews Roses was established by Tom Matthews and is now owned by his son Bob, while Chris Cvitanovich is the third-generation owner of Wanganui Garden Centre, set up by his grandfather Ivan. The two businesses have been working together since 1947 and had a joint celebration for their 70th anniversaries in 2017.
Now, as part of his "My Rose Collection" range, Bob Matthews has bred a new rose exclusively for Wanganui Garden Centre to celebrate their long association of growing gorgeous gardens together.
The rose is named A Gardener's Dream (Mattrae) in tribute to Chris' mother, the late Rae Cvitanovich.
"I remember coming in here [Wanganui Garden Centre] as a kid, watching Chris' mum and dad doing jobs - and his grandfather too," Matthews said.
"Breeding roses is a labour of love. I've been doing it since I was a kid. An individual variety could take six to 10 years to breed. Out of every 1000 seedlings, you might only pick 10 to look at - and you might throw all those away."
Matthews Roses are bred spray-free and rarely get disease, he said.

The new rose is bred from My Mum, one of Matthews Roses' most popular varieties and a top seller at Wanganui Garden Centre. Matthews named it after his mother, Pearl.
"It's very successful - we sell mega of it," Cvitanovich said.
"It's the most in-demand bush rose we've ever sold. Last year we sold 100 of it. It's very healthy, strong growing - it ticks all the boxes."
