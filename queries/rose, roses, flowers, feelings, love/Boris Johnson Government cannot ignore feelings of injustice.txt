Boris Johnson has addressed the UK's Black Lives Matter protests, as activists plan a peaceful gathering in London to mark George Floyd’s funeral.
The Prime Minister tweeted a video message last night saying Mr Floyd’s death had awakened an “incontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice” worldwide.
“And we who lead and who govern simply can’t ignore those feelings because in too many cases, I am afraid, they will be founded on a cold reality,” he said.
He concluded: “Let’s work peacefully, lawfully, to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together across all the communities of this country, as we put Britain back on its feet.”
This evening anti-racism demonstrators will take part in a symbolic and socially distanced commemoration in London as George Floyd is laid to rest in the US.
The gathering, organised by Stand Up To Racism, will take place at the Nelson Mandela statue in Parliament Square at 5pm.
Stand Up To Racism co-convenor Sabby Dhalu said: “The uprising of black communities and others against racism since (George) Floyd was killed must lead to transformation against racial discrimination. We demand justice.”
