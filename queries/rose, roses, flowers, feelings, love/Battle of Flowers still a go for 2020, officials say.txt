SAN ANTONIO – You can count on the Battle of Flowers Parade to be a big part of Fiesta despite the 11-day party being moved from April to November due to the coronavirus , officials said Sunday.
Parade association officials held a news conference to reassure the public that the Fiesta favorite will be held.
“The Battle of Flowers is where Fiesta began 129 years ago, and we won’t be stopping now,” said Anna Laura Block, Battle of Flowers Association president. “We feel our events must go on.”
Block said the decision for the show to go on was made after discussions were had with key stakeholders.
“We felt like it was something we had to do. We had to give it our best try. If the Battle of Flowers did not step up, we would not be serving our community,” she said.
Block said the parade is important to the nonprofits, participants and families.
In addition, the Battle of Flowers Bands Festival, which is held at Alamo Stadium, will also be held.
Fiesta officials announced on Friday that the citywide party will be held from Nov. 5-15.
COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new virus, stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The disease first appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, but spread around the world in early 2020, causing the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic in March.
