The track sees itself in a mixed world of a futuristic post-apocalyptic David Lynch word, combined with post-punk and 80s retro influence. The track features a psych sense and atmosphere that really does become its own thing. The song is his reaction to being under lockdown for 3 months, locked in his recording studio.
About “Flowers For Dystopia” he says:
One night, in a dream, I imagined walking out on a stage in some dingy East Village club, with the band playing this riff. I approach the mic and, like a wizard’s incantation, call out “Objects!, Objects!”. I woke up in the middle of the night, ran down into his studio and started recording it.
