MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the number of Covid-19 testing laboratories in the state has now increased to 100 from two in the past. The number of such labs will keep increasing, he said.
Addressing Shiv Sena leaders and office-bearers online on the occasion of the party's 54th anniversary, Thackeray said that doctors were being provided all the required equipment like masks, PPE kits and hand gloves as they combat the disease.
He also informed the party workers that he would take part in the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the Galwan Valley clash.
"The Sahyadri (Maharashtra) will be with the Himalaya during the crisis hour," he said.
Twenty Indian Army personnel, including a colonel, were killed in a fierce clash with the Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night.
Thackeray said his contact with the partymen might have become less frequent after he became the chief minister, but he would never distance himself from them.
Stating that Shiv Sena was born to fight injustice, Thackeray said he would carry forward the legacy of his late father and party founder Bal Thackeray.
He said the Shiv Sena shakhas (branches) in the city will be turned into temporary clinics to treat patients.
He also praised the party workers, saying that they are never afraid of any crisis and work for the people by putting everything else aside.
"Let there be any storm or any cyclone or any other crisis. I am not afraid of anything till the Shiv Sainiks (workers) like you are with me," Thackeray said.
Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray also spoke on the occasion and pitched for expanding the party's base in each of the country's states.
