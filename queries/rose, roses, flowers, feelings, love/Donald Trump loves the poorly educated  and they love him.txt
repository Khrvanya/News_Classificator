Donald Trump speaks what's on his mind, often as soon as it appears there. And after winning his third-straight contest in Nevada Tuesday, Trump credited his "poorly educated" supporters, in part, for the win.
"We won the evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated," he said during his victory speech .
Let's set aside the fact that "poorly educated" is not the same as "less educated" and look at the numbers:
Trump did well across the board in Nevada, garnering 45.9% of the vote , but he did even better among voters with a high school education or less. Fifty-seven percent of those voters supported him, according to entrance polls , courtesy of CNN.
The next closest candidate among high-school-or-less voters was Ted Cruz, who had 20%.
That's a sizable gap of 37 percentage points.
Trump didn't just win with less educated voters, or "poorly educated," as he called them, he crushed it.
It's true Trump did perform the best of any candidate among highly educated voters, too, but not nearly so well.
He gained 37% of the votes from those with postgraduate education, with Marco Rubio earning 29%
As much as Trump loves the "poorly educated," he didn't want to join them: The Ivy League grad got his degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 .
Trump's "poorly educated" line sparked much reaction, including smirking and shock .
less educated voters and the resulting shock may only cause those less educated voters to embrace Trump all the more.
