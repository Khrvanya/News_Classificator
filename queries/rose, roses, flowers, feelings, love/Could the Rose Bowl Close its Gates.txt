The COVID-19 pandemic is certainly delivering financial blows to the U.S. economy.
It has, in fact, delivered a pretty substantial setback to the iconic Rose Bowl, UCLA's home stadium for the last 38 years.
A Los Angeles Times story from yesterday reports how the Rose Bowl has lost substantial revenue from the pandemic shutdown and faces an uncertain financial future.
On Monday the Pasadena City Council issued a warning to the Rose Bowl Operating Company about its mounting debt.
The story goes into detail about the Rose Bowl's lost revenue even before the lockdown, due to a changing marketplace and the drop in revenue from poorly-attended UCLA games in recent years.
Coming up with a plan back to solvency could involve some substantial cuts to the Rose Bowl budget, which could be too much to bear.
The article says that, at this stage, there isn't a discussion about potentially shuttering the historic stadium.
Of course, the possibility of that, leaves the UCLA community wondering: if the Rose Bowl did close its doors, and then breach its contract with UCLA, what would UCLA football do for its home games?
UCLA does have an option -- SoFi Stadium, the glistening, new home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers.  The details, of course, of any arrangement between UCLA and SoFI are unknown and probably undetermined and only speculative at this point.  SoFi is in Inglewood, a straight shot down the 405 Freeway, and only 13 miles away from UCLA's campus, about half the distance to the Rose Bowl.  It's also a state-of-the-art facility with plenty of amenities.
For most UCLA fans, though, having to play UCLA home games any other place than the almost hallowed ground of the Rose Bowl would be tragic.
