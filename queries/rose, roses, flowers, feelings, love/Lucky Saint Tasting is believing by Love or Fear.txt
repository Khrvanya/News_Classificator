Lucky Saint hypes its alcohol-free beer with an out-of-home campaign.
The work features enticing close-up shots of the brandâ€™s 0.5% ABV pint, encouraging parched consumers to try a sip for themselves via the tagline "tasting is believing".
Kicking off in 16 cities across the UK alongside social, digital and influencer-focused activity, the campaign was created by Dave Dye, while media was handled by Posterscope.
