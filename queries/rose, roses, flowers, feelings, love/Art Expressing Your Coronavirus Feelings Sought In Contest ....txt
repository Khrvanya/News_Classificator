ROGERS PARK — A Rogers Park nonprofit is asking Chicago residents to channel their feelings on the coronavirus outbreak into works of art — with contest winners receiving a cash prize.
Circles & Ciphers, a hip-hop infused restorative justice organization, has launched a contest called the #SocialDistanceChallenge. The contest is calling for artwork submissions that express the artists’ thoughts on the coronavirus pandemic, measures like social distancing and the government’s response to the outbreak.
“We said, what can we do for people feeling this outbreak in some level?” said Akeem Soyan, creative arts liaison for Circles & Ciphers. “We thought that doing something creative could help people out.”
Works of art that can be submitted include poems, freestyles, artwork, songs, spoken word, dance routines, Tik Tok videos and other short videos, according to Circles & Ciphers.
The idea for the contest is to get people busy with creative projects during this time of social distancing and self quarantining. It can also help people connect virtually, the group said.
“There are people who don’t have a lot to do,” said Marko Stats, a member of Circles & Ciphers. “We still want to promote that creativity, to encourage people to do something positive.”
Entries are due by April 10. To submit entries, post the work of art to social media using the hashtag #SocialDistanceChallenge and #mystateofmind and make sure to tag @circles_ciphers.
