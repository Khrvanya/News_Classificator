Whether Lin-Manuel Miranda is standing with President Obama in the Rose Garden or accepting a Grammy Award onstage, he is known to give his audience a freestyle rap fit for the occasion.
On Sunday, when Mr. Miranda accepted his award for best score for "Hamilton‚Äù at the Tony Awards, his second Tony win in this category, he said he was too old to freestyle. So he wrote a sonnet instead, addressing his love for his wife, Vanessa Nadal, as well as the shooting massacre that left 50 people dead early Sunday in Orlando, Fla.
Our son is her most beautiful reprise.
That nothing here is promised, not one day.
We lived through times when hate and fear seemed stronger;
We rise and fall and light from dying embers, remembrances that hope and love last longer
And love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love cannot be killed or swept aside.
Now fill the world with music, love and pride.
