Love Island Australia is officially back!
A new batch of Aussie contestants have moved into the villa, ready to meet their new neighbours and find romance both home and away (sorry).
While the action has moved from sunny Spain to sunny Fiji for the latest instalment, the second series looks set to be just as dramatic as the first.
But what's happened to last year's couples? Well, here's the lowdown on who's still together and who's not.
Grant and Tayla may have won the show, but their relationship wasn't exactly triumphant.
Shortly after telling Now To Love that they were planning to use their $50k prize money to move to Sydney together, they ended things because of rumours Grant had a "secret girlfriend" named Lucy.
Judging by his Instagram page , Grant is now well and truly loved-up with Lucy â€“ although he's denied they were an item before the show.
Meanwhile, Tayla began dating fellow Love Island Australia contestant Dom Thomas last October, though they broke up earlier this year.
They confirmed their split on social media in June, in a YouTube video entitled 'Answering your question; Have we broken up?'.
Last year's runners-up have also gone their separate ways. Two months after the show wrapped, they shared a joint statement on Instagram.
"We look back and cherish the time we have spent together, the memories we have created, in both Spain and in Australia," they wrote.
"We can't thank each and everyone of you enough, for the support and love you have shown us, but we have to be honest within ourselves as we realise that our forever as a couple, is no longer."
