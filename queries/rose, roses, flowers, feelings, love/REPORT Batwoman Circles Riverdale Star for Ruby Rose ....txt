Riverdale star Vanessa Morgan is reportedly being eyed to replace Ruby Rose as The CW's Batwoman.
The Cinema Spot reports the network is eying Morgan to star as Ryan Wilder, the brand new character that is being created to take up the mantle of Batwoman after Rose's sudden departure. The site also reports Morgan will do a screen test for the role with the other members of the Batwoman cast.
Morgan recently made the news when she expressed her frustration in regard to black characters being used as "sidekicks" on Riverdale. She added that there is a significant pay gap between herself and her castmates, and that she will not take on any more roles unless they accurately depict black people.

Batwoman showrunner Caroline Dries recently discussed the reasoning behind creating a brand new character instead of hiring an actor to play the role of Kate Kane.
"I just think it helps the audience a little bit, too, that we’re not asking them to not address the elephant in the room," Dries said . "I’m inventing a whole new character. In her past, she was inspired by Batwoman. She is going to take on the mantle and is completely maybe not be the right person at the time to be doing it. That’s what makes it fun."
Returning to The CW in Jan. 2021, Batwoman stars Rachel Skarsten, Meagan Tandy, Camrus Johnson, Dougray Scott and Nicole Kang. The series airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
