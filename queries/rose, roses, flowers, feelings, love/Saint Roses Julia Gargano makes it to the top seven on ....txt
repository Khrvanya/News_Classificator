Julia Gargano made it to the top seven of ABC’s “American Idol” during Sunday night’s Disney-themed episode.
The Staten Island native and College of Saint Rose senior sang “Beauty and the Beast.” Her performance was met with mixed feedback from the judges Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.
“The song was a little bit low in my opinion,”  Bryan said.
Richie agreed, saying, “The performance was amazing, it’s just that on this particular song, the lows did not compliment you as well.”
During the episode, Gargano also sang “Sweetest Devotion” by Adele in honor of Mother’s Day.
“Truthfully that’s one of the best vocals I’ve heard you do in quite a long time because you believed it. You were in that moment,” Richie said.
“I love hearing your voice expand from ballads to pop songs to classic songs. I think this is just going to be a fantastic launching pad for you,” Perry said.
Gargano has been a favorite of Perry’s since her “Idol” audition, though the singer/songwriter has been praised by the other judges as well throughout the show.
The season finale airs on Sunday, during which Gargano will face off against Arthur Gunn, Dillon James, Louis Knight, Francisco Martin Just Sam and Jonny West. The episode starts at 8 p.m.
