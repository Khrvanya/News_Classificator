Ahead of this match, the Roses hadn't won an opening quarter in the competition. The trend continued in London, as did another for three quarters, which was dropping off in the final minutes of quarters.
The Roses found themselves 19-15 down after 15 minutes and Thirlby made the first of many personnel changes in order to try and things around.
She introduce the highly experienced Chelsea Pitman at WA and shifted captain Natalie Haythornthwaite to GA.
A settled Jamaican line-up continued to press in the second quarter and converted their centre passes to goal well. In contrast, a few errors plagued the Roses' work and they again dipped as the quarter came to a close.
Latanya Wilson, who came on towards half-time, gained a key turnover as did Shamera Sterling. The two players' turnover ball was being converted beautifully due to the effectiveness of Fowler and it helped to create a 39-31 half-time cushion.
Head coach Thirlby used half-time to make further shifts in personnel. Amy Carter, who had arrived at the end of the first half, moved to Centre with Pitman combining with her at WA.
The Sunshine Girls continued to press after the pause though, and surged 11 goals up with nine minutes of the third quarter remaining.
Thirlby decided that was the point to amend the that picture they were seeing in defence. Razia Quashie entered the fray at GK and Francis moved out to GD.
The pairing enjoyed some dominance against Shimona Nelson, who arrived briefly, but as soon as Fowler returned in the final quarter, she held firm again.
In the final quarter, Roses' fans in the crowd produced an electric atmosphere and their voices were rewarded by a stunning comeback with the gap moving from 13 goals down to four at full-time.
England's fluidity in attack had returned after a final set of changes and the combination of of George Fisher, Cardwell and Haythornthwaite at GS-GA-WA shone.
