Father’s Day isn’t always a happy occasion. There are many children and adults for which this holiday reminds them of the absence of a father or father figure. In this week’s Modern Love essay , the writer Tara Ellison shares how growing up without a father has left her avoiding the greeting card aisles every June, which for her is “a painful reckoning of paternal loss.”
And, while isolating with a partner has proved to be the ultimate stress test for many couples, the reality TV sweethearts Lauren Speed and Cameron Hamilton , of Netflix’s “Love is Blind,” have found fun ways to stay entertained. In recent weeks, the couple has also tackled tough conversations surrounding race and current news events.
If you haven’t heard about Juneteenth (which is today!) , the annual holiday centered on community, culture and food that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, our culture writers have suggestions on how you can join in on the celebration and learn more.
Be safe and enjoy Juneteenth.
