There is typically nothing funny about a virus that kills people, but the quarantine has given the world Leslie Jordan and his daily Instagram posts, which are indeed hilarious. So funny, in fact, People magazine has put Jordan and his posts at No. 99 on its 2020 list of "100 Reasons to Love America."
Jordan announced his inclusion during his Sunday post.
"I just found out I'm in People magazine," he said in the post. "It's the next edition. June 29. It's got Tyler Perry on the cover.
"What an honor and each of you had a part in that because you're the ones who tune in everyday to hear about all of my shenanigans. So, we should all be proud that we're in People magazine."
He also points out that if you "flip-flopped it, I would be No. 2. Ninety-nine, well that means the best  almost."
Jordan grew up in Chattanooga before becoming a star of TV, stage and movies. He played Brother Boy in "Sordid Lives" and Beverley Leslie in "Will and Grace." He will appear in "Call Me Kat" this fall on Fox.
Other recent Instagram posts feature Jordan singing a favorite childhood hymn called "There is Power in the Blood" with Travis Howard, and a quick story about an "Ally McBeal" episode he appeared in featuring a young Josh Grobin.
