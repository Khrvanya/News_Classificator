Democratic Staten Island Rep. Max Rose, who is facing a well-funded Republican challenge to his re-election, endorsed Michael Bloomberg’s presidential bid, The Post has learned.
“He thinks Bloomberg will help with his re-election money,” a source told The Post.
Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican, is running for Rose’s seat in the 11th Congressional District, which skews right of center politically. The freshman Democrat and Army veteran Rose beat GOP Rep. Dan Donovan in 2018.
Rose is Bloomberg’s first congressional endorsement.
He cited Bloomberg’s leadership following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks as a top reason for the nod.
“The city Mike Bloomberg inherited in 2002 was reeling from the worst terrorist attack in American history and facing economic recession. Mike Bloomberg took the reins, brought New York City back to life and put us on track to lead in the 21st century,” Rose said.
Bloomberg added in a joint press statement that the congressman shares his independent streak.
“Max Rose understands what public service is all about: working for the people, not a political party, lobbyists or your own self-interest,” Bloomberg said.
The duo have not always been politically aligned.
Bloomberg spent tens of millions of dollars helping Democrats takeover control of the House of Representatives in 2018, although the billionaire media mogul actually backed Donovan’s unsuccessful re-election bid.
At the time, Rose called Bloomberg’s use of stop-and-frisk “unconstitutional,” before the former three-term mayor apologized for his use of the controversial policing tactic.
Less than two hours after Rose’s endorsement, another moderate Democratic congressman from New York threw his support behind former Vice President Joe Biden.
Maloney, who represents a Hudson Valley district that Trump won in 2016, said Biden could heal a fractured nation.
“Joe Biden will seek to unite us as Americans and drain the poison out of our divided politics,” Maloney said.
