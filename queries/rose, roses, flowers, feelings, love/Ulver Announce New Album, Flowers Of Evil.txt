Ulver have shared details of a new album, titled Flowers Of Evil.
Coming three years on from their last studio album, The Assassination Of Julius Caesar, Flowers Of Evil sees the Norwegian group team up with Michael Rendall of The Orb and producer Martin "Youth" Glover. Past collaborator Christian Fennesz also adds guitar and electronics to opening track 'One Last Dance'.
Above, you can hear 'Little Boy', the second single to be unveiled from the album, which will arrive alongside a 336-page book, reflecting on over 25 years of Ulver history, called Wolves Evolve: The Ulver Story.
"We've been talking about making a book – the Ulver story – for years," the band say. "First for our 15th anniversary, then for our 20th anniversary, and now, after well over a quarter of a century, the time has come. We've been riding this beast for the greater part of our lives, and the future is not what it used to be."
The book includes 150 pages of conversation with the band, as well as a number of photographs from the private archives of the band and others.
House Of Mythology will release Flowers Of Evil and Wolves Evolve: The Ulver Story on August 28, 2020.
