With the George Floyd demonstrations and riots I’ve noticed, as should most people, that the police that have been targeted by the protestors are directed by the political dictates of the administrations that they serve. Throughout the nation, police chiefs and commissioners are chosen by politicians that expect to have the department follow an agenda that their administration chooses. Law enforcement is supposed to be autonomously applied without favor to anyone. Does it?
The flavor of the month is defund the police, but what would we have? One city said social workers, but “kumbaya” may not work in a violent domestic dispute. Another said to have neighborhood groups prowling the streets, but where would victims go? Every society, whether democratic or socialist, has a body to keep order, but defunding the police would lead to  chaos.  A legitimate problem is being hijacked by violent groups while Floyd is rendered moot. As many political leaders and news elites excuse the violence, there are many men and women of all races and faiths that have lost everything they have worked for when their businesses went up in flames.
Floyd’s murder was a despicable act and the officers involved should get the full punishment, but when something goes bump in the night, do you call your local gang banger or the police? Decisions made during conflict based on feelings instead of facts are never good ones and difficult to rescind. I’ve been acquainted with many rank-and-file police officers and found them to be professional and caring. Many political bureaucrats are less so, and when their political policies go awry they tend to throw the blame on everyone else. Save some of the criticism for the administrations they serve.
