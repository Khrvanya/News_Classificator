'Bachelor In Paradise's' Jamie Doran Promises His Rose To Five (Yes, Five) Women
Channel 10 has released the latest trailer for its upcoming season of Bachelor In Paradise , which sees Jamie Doran - who was branded as the 'stage five clinger' during Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette - promise his rose to five (yes, five) women.
The trailer shows Doran promising Abbie Chatfield, Brittney Weldon, Cassandra Mamone, Helena Sauzier and Mary Viturino roses, admitting: "I believe having a rose is more stressful than when you don't have a rose."
"I think Jamie thinks he's the Bachelor," Timm Hanly tells the camera. "He's promising these roses to all these girls..."
Watch the new trailer below:
Jamie's Makes A Bouquet Of Promises In Paradise. Bachelor In Paradise Australia. Coming Soon To 10.
Last week, two more trailers for the highly-anticipated series dropped.
The first trailer features fan favourites Brittany Hockley and Timm Hanly. "Timm in no way is my type. Never ever have I dated anybody like him," Britt says, while Timm tells the camera, "Brittany's absolutely gorgeous. She's so well-spoken, those piercing blue eyes, like ooof..."
The next trailer features Abbie Chatfield and Ciarran Stott. "As the rest of Australia does, I have a bit of a crush on Ciarran," Abbie began. "I came here for Ciarran. I think he's great, he and I are really compatible."
But, as it would seem, Abbie's not the only one with her eyes set on Ciarran, with Jessica Brody also expressing interest. In another previously released trailer, Ciarran kisses Jessica while sitting on a surfboard. "We had the most perfect kiss, in the most perfect setting," Jessica said in the voice over. But the romantic moment came crashing to an end during a dramatic dinner party. Ciarran storms away from the table, saying: "F*** off! I'm f***ing going!"
