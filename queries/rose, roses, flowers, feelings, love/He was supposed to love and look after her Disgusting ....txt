"When he logged on he saw his daughter sat on the couch with the defendant sat next to her," Mr Mackintosh said.
"She had her knees up and her laptop on her thigh.

"[The father] called his wife who said it was 'probably nothing'. Her father continued to watch and saw the other two children come in. Their grandfather again told them get out and play.
"He got up shut the door and continued to touch her. A short time later the other two children returned. He stopped what he was doing."
When the girl's father returned from work he asked her if her grandfather had been touching her and she said he had been doing it all that week.
When the girl's mother confronted the grandfather and asked why he had carried out the abuse, he said that he "didn't know".

"She's been taken advantage of by someone who was supposed to love and look after her. Someone we all trusted and left in charge of her care.
"He took advantage of all of us to satisfy his selfish and perverted needs. This has without question changed our lives forever.
