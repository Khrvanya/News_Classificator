The Traverse Bay Area ISD Career Tech Center was out delivering flowers on Tuesday around the community.
The baskets were a project by the CTC’s Agriscience and Natural Resource Program.
dents can attend competitions and other events.
Since they could not have a sale this year, students and faculty decided to donate the flower baskets to health care workers at Munson and residents at the Grand Traverse Pavilions.
The career tech center says even though students were not out delivering on Tuesday, they are still an important part of this donation.
“This is all student driven. In fact, I met with our students yesterday and I let them know that we’re delivering these on behalf of the students for the hard work that they do in our program, the learning that they do every year, and a great way for them inadvertently I guess to give back to our community,” said CTC Instructor Brian Matchett.
At the end of the day, the team delivered more than 200 hanging flower baskets.
