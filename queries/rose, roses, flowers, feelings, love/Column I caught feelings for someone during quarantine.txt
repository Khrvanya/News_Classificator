An MSU student checks social media during the Coronavirus stay-in-place quarantine on March 30, 2020. —
After four weeks of being confined to the same couch while endlessly scrolling through TikTok , I have uncovered a few truths that quarantine has shed light on:
While I am still undecided about the looks of my "quaranstache," I did learn something else about myself, something I didn’t expect to learn during this period of detachment.
If you start to catch feelings for someone right now, be prepared. Be prepared for a lengthy (and I mean LENGTHY) couple of weeks of social distancing .
Be prepared for night-long phone calls that run into the next morning. Be prepared for wanting to break your goody-two-shoes vow of staying quarantined to go see him or her (but please don't).
But, don’t worry. It’s OK to be unprepared. I was.
I wasn’t prepared for the initial text she sent me. However, with the encouragement of a mutual friend (thank you), we started talking … a lot.
Small talk via texting quickly turned into late-night conversations over FaceTime. And as we had gotten to know each other better, I continued to find myself in a deeper plight.
The only way I could engage with the person who I was quickly falling for was by seeing her through a screen.
I wish I could add more to this story. I really do. And when that happens, I’ll let you know.
Yet, the cold truth is that talking to someone you truly like without being able to see him or her is painfully difficult.
My former baseball coach used to say, “Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is perseverance.”
