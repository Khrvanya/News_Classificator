Mandy Rose and Lana are on different WWE brands, but they just dropped a combined brand dance video.
The two WWE Superstars were poolside and had their dance moves down. We have to wonder how many takes they did of the same dance. It was obviously enough to get the perfect version down.
A number of female WWE Superstars including Lana and Rose were recently spotted on a boat. Click here to check out that footage of them in bikinis on a boat. They might have been shooting for Total Divas.
This video was definitely something unexpected for fans who saw it appear on their Instagram stories. You can check out the video below thanks to our Official Ringside News Instagram account.
