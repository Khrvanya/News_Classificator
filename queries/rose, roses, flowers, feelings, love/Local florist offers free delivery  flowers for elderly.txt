Local businesses are doing what they can to not only stay open but also make people feel good.
DEPEW, N.Y. (WKBW) â€” Local businesses are doing what they can to not only stay open but also make people feel good.
Elaine's Flower Shoppe in Depew is doing just that.
They are offering free delivery on all orders for customers. You can order online and use the code "DelSmile" for free delivery.  This includes all orders. You can order chocolates, goodie baskets, and of course flowers.
But Elaine's is also donating some of their extra roses, carnations, and daisies. They are more giving flowers to Elderwood Nursing Home in Lancaster.
Owners Dona Kurowiak and Dale McCormick say they want to help bring some happiness to the people that need it.
"We have the flowers, and our designers are great, we thought this would cheer people up, and everyone loves to receive flowers," McCormick said.
They say they don't just deliver flowers, but they provide smiles. McCormick is doing the deliveries and says they are taking the extra precautions of sanitation and has a minimum staff.
The owners say they will do this for as long as they can.
