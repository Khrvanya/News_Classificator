Justin Rose and his wife, Kate, will sponsor a series of women’s golf tournaments for British professionals, beginning this month, according to The Telegraph.
“I haven’t held a scorecard in my hand since January,” Hull, a four-time European Solheim Cup player, told The Telegraph. “It feels so good to be back.”
The Roses are backing the series as support for English women’s golf. He’s competing at this week’s RBC Heritage on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. Several sponsors have also stepped up to help.
“Being a player himself, Justin understands that you get rusty if you don’t play,” Kate Rose, who was at Brockenhurst Manor, told The Telegraph. “We just thought this was a great chance for everyone to get rid of the cobwebs so when the main tour finally does get underway they will be ready.”
Hull and Young met in the playoff after shooting even-par 70s in the single-day event. Young was the force initially behind the series, having come up with the idea for a one-day event to help English female players during the coronavirus pandemic. The Roses offered to turn the idea into a series.
