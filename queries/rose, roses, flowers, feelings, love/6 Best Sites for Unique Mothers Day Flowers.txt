Whoever you're shopping for this Mother's Day—mom, stepmom, grandma, godmother, auntie, dog mom, you name it—there's one gift (most) moms love: flowers! But we're not talking any old cookie-cutter bouquet. We plan on sending our moms something truly unique this year, especially since we can't be there in person to give hugs.
From farm-fresh finds to one-of-a-kind bouquets to allergy-friendly options, below are our favorite floral delivery services to shower your loved one with flowers.
If you're on Instagram, then you've surely seen Bouqs blossoming in your feed. The Bouqs Co. partners with eco-friendly farms that minimize waste, recycle water and use sustainable growing practices. Prices start at $49. We recommend the Virtual Hug Bouquet , made up of sunflowers, roses and mums and comes with a delicate gold infinity necklace by 31 Bits.
Urban Stems sources directly from Rainforest Alliance Certified™ farms to ship to their warehouses, where bouquets are assembled and delivered in beautiful packaging. And trust, Urban Stems makes some truly on-trend arrangements you won't find anywhere else. Prices start at $55. We love The Celeste Bouquet , made up of roses, delphinium, thistle and snapdragons and ivory, and a little bit of sweetness with Sugarfina's Pink Pineapples.
