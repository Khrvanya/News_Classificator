Yes, your snow-covered yard can still be bright in the colder months.
Whether you live in the snowy North or the sunny South or somewhere in between, not everything in your garden is asleep from December to March. Even during the coldest days of the year, you may be surprised to know that many annual flowers , perennial flowers and flowering shrubs don’t wait for spring to show off. Some hardy little souls bloom long before the snow has melted! And in mild climates, some winter flowers will bloom all season long.
Before setting your heart on any of these beauties, make sure it’s suited to your USDA Hardiness Zone (check yours here ). Then read plant descriptions and labels to make sure you’ll be able to give a plant what it needs, such as full sun or shade. And just so you know, full sun is considered six or more hours per day; part sun is about half that. There’s no sense trying to outsmart Mother Nature, because you just won’t win! A plant given the wrong conditions simply won’t thrive. Pay attention to planting times too. Most winter bloomers, including bulbs, need put in the ground in the fall in order for you to enjoy the best winter flowers.
Even when you’re counting down the days until spring, you can daydream about planting these flowers that bloom in winter to enjoy in your garden next year. (Not sure where to start? Check out our free garden plans right here.)
These gorgeous flowers, also known as hellebores, bloom in early winter in mild climates and late winter in cold regions. Even though they appear delicate, they don’t need to be coddled because they’re undemanding and super cold-hardy.
