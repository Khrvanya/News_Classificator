Alexithymia has a strong link to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with a 2018 study indicating that approximately half of autistic people likely have alexithymia. It is especially prevalent in those with complex ASD.
Other research proposes that the social and emotional difficulties experienced by those with ASD may not be a feature of autism, but rather of co-occurring alexithymia.
Alexithymia commonly co-occurs with certain mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Some results indicate that clinical features of depression are at least somewhat dependent on the presence of alexithymia. Those with co-occurring depressive disorders and alexithymia are likely to demonstrate more severe symptoms of depression, psychosis , and phobias .
Research has shown that those with PTSD may be at higher risk of alexythemia.
A few small studies suggest that alexithymia is higher among those with PTSD.
One study of 22 war veterans with PTSD found that 41% had alexithymia.
A 1997 study comparing Holocaust survivors with and without PTSD found that survivors with PTSD had significantly higher scores on tests for alexithymia than those without PTSD.
A 2013 study on 50 children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) suggests an association between alexithymia and hyperactivity and impulsivity, although not with inattentiveness.
A 2017 review indicates that, across the spectrum of eating disorders, people report problems being able to identify or describe their emotions. Other research links higher levels of alexithymia with poorer treatment outcomes for eating disorders.
Research links alexithymia with other conditions , including:
