Mother's Day is Sunday, May 10, and while your usual plans may be on hold due to social distancing, gifting Mom a beautiful bouquet of flowers is still possible.

Mother's Day is typically a time for families to get together to celebrate the moms in their lives, but this year will surely be a little different.
While most people won't get the opportunity to visit their moms or do traditional activities like going out to brunch this year, one thing remains constant: Flowers are, and will always be, a great way to show Mom how much you appreciate her on Mother's Day.
That said, Mother's Day is easily the busiest time of year for florists, but you can expect it to be even busier this year. The best way to make sure your flowers get delivered on time is to place your order in advance — and you'll probably save some money that way, too.
