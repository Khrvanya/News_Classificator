Justin Rose’s professional relationship with Honma is over. The Englishman signed a new deal to play Honma clubs in 2019, ending his 20-year relationship with TaylorMade. The big reason for this was flexibility, ultimately allowing him to be able to use whatever putter he liked. But he teed it up at the 2020 Arnold Palmer Invitational without a single Honma club in his bag. And now it’s official.
So what’s in Rose’s bag?
Rose started the season with a Honma TR20 460 driver but made the switch into the TaylorMade SIM. He’s also put in a TaylorMade SIM 3-wood and a Cobra Speedzone 5-wood.
