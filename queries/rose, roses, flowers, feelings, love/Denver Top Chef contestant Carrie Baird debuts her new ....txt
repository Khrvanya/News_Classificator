Baird collaborates on the new project with her hall neighbor, chef Natascha Hess of The Ginger Pig. The two met when Baird mentored Hess in the kitchen at Brazen, then Baird helped Hess to open her own food truck.

“We would love to do a full-sized breakfast, fancy-toast-forward restaurant, someday, somewhere,” Baird said of their future.
For now, fans can stop by Rosetta Hall to see Baird cooking like she’s got something to prove again.
