The Los Angeles jeweler goes outside the box for her latest creation, part of our Designer D.I.Y. series.
“On a typical day, I’d be in my studio designing,” said Irene Neuwirth, a jewelry designer known for her use of candy-colored gems. “It’s what I love to do and where I love to be.”
But while sheltering in place at her California home, Ms. Neuwirth hadn’t just lost access to her creative space, but also to her storage of precious and semiprecious stones. What’s a jewelry designer to do without her jewels?
Go back to the basics — sketching and painting — and play around with some new materials.
Here, Ms. Neuwirth used one of her spring 2020 designs as inspiration for a colorful, one-of-a-kind necklace. She completed the project in about three hours, she said, “with pauses to take the dogs out, sit in the yard, answer emails.”
