John Legend had a great Father's Day. Not only did the "Bigger Love" singer get to spend Sunday (June 21) with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, and their kids -- Luna, 4 and Miles, 2 -- but he also invited along a bunch of fellow singers and celebs to join him for the prime-time ABC special John Legend and Family: A Bigger Love Father's Day.
There was a game of "Fatherly Feud" in which he was joined by fellow A-list dads Anthony Anderson, Patton Oswalt, Roy Wood Jr., Lil Rel Howery, Jim Gaffigan and Ike Barinholtz. During the game, the fathers all Skyped in on iPads mounted on robot heads to answer the very important question: What do you do when your child gets hurt? "It's not my fault" is not an answer, Gaffigan, but survey says "walk it off" is.
The show also included Legend performing the Bigger Love burner "I Do" poolside as Teigen and the kids watched and danced with pride. He also offered the emotional ballad "Never Break," which was enhanced by images of fathers with their children, and his cover of Elton John's "Your Song."
Legend even shared the inspiring story of how he built a bike for Luna for her birthday in a hilarious parody of the Michael Jackson ESPN doc The Last Dance (now The Last Dad). It featured Howery, podcast host/sports analyst Tony Gonzalez, Marlon Wayans, Ahmad Rashad and Shaquille O'Neal talking about what a terrible guy the legendarily nice singer is.
Snoop Dogg also stopped by in a dream sequence, while Modern Family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Pippen and Common wereÂ among the dads who popped in to tell terrible dad jokes, and Wonder didn't recognize the singer when he called. The kids also did Legend's taxes, and Teigen made up for forgetting about Father's Day by repurposing Legend's "Glory" Oscar into a "World's Good Dad" trophy.
