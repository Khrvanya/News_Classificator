SACRAMENTO, Calif. â€” Roses are a classic Valentine's Day gift for a reason. They're usually given with the sentiment of love and romance in mind, but you could be sending the wrong message depending on the color of those flowers.
Flowers and what they represent have been recognized for centuries in Europe and Asia, even playing a large role in the works of William Shakespeare, according to the Farmer's Almanac. From Greek Mythologies to Chinese plays, works of art are associated with flowers and plant symbolism.
It wasn't until the Victorian Era that learning each flower's symbolism became a popular pastime. Flowers were often used to deliver messages that couldn't be read out loud and nearly all Victorian homes had guidebooks for learning the "language" of flowers.
