Flower pickers at the Electric Daisy Flower Farm near Bath.
The Electric Daisy Flower Farm’s business relied on selling its blooms grown near Bath at a newly opened shop in Hampstead, north London.
The shop – only open since February – closed on 17 March with an abundance of unsold flowers.
“And they keep on growing,” Bizony says. “On the day we closed the shop, all the spring flowers that were delivered from our farm to London, I decided to give away to anyone who happened to pass by.”
After Bizony saw an article about how a Dutch market was dealing with the same problem, she decided to donate bouquets of flowers to key workers at the Royal United hospital in Bath, and others to the care home where her mother lives. Other key workers are also receiving them and they have been donated to funerals.
