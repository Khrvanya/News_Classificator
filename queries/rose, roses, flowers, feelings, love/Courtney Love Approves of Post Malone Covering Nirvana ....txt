Courtney Love attends the LOVE Magazine LFW Party, celebrating issue 23 at The Standard on Feb. 17, 2020 in London.
Post Malone has Courtney Love 's stamp of approval. The rapper had announced on Wednesday (April 22) that he would be performing Nirvana songs from home during a livestream performance on Friday (April 24) to raise money for coronavirus relief efforts.
"Thank you @postmalone," the Hole frontwoman captioned a screengrab of a news story about the event on Instagram late Wednesday night. "I approve the usage. Good luck mr malone."
Before ending her message, Love also gave a shout-out to her late husband and Nirvana frontman, Kurt Cobain: "Thank you mighty kc for writing these songs with your elegant and monkeyed hands that the kids still want to sing and play and hear and use to fight and hunt and cure and heal and eradicate this f--king covid19 virus."

Malone's tribute to Nirvana will include covers of the iconic Seattle grunge band's hits, as well as fan-favorite tunes. The live stream will benefit The United Nations Foundation's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization. Google will match up to $5 million in donations made during the performance, which kicks off at 6:00 p.m. EST on the rapper's YouTube channel .
This won't be the first time the artist has covered Nirvana. Malone -- a Nirvana fan who has one of their song titles tattooed on his face as well as portrait of Cobain on his left middle finger -- has previously performed the band's hits during shows, including "All Apologies."
Since the coronavirus pandemic has led to the cancellation of numerous 2020 tours and music festivals, musicians have started performing with at-home livestreams to raise money for various relief efforts.
