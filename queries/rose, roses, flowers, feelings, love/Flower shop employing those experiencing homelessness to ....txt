A flower shop employing people transitioning out of homelessness in Oklahoma City is set to open this August.
Thanks to grant funding, the Curbside Chronicle is opening a brick-and-mortar flower shop providing delivery, pre-orders, a small retail space and event flowers, according to a news release.
This permanent space will enhance existing events like Curbside’s Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day flower sales.
Previously, employment opportunities for vendors would be confined to time slots around specific holidays. Now, vendors will be able to work year round.
The Curbside Flowers shop will be built at 522 N Classen Blvd. The Curbside Chronicle still is looking for additional donations to buy equipment and purchase a delivery vehicle.
