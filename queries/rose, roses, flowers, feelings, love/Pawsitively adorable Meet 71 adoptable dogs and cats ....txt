Chaz has LOADS of personality at only 10 weeks old. We think he is a Corgi/Rat Terrier mix and so cute! He loves playing with toys, and his name probably should have been Tigger because he bounces everywhere! Chaz’s adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts will cover costs for all vaccines, the neuter procedure and microchip.

Meet Markie, and his story is a touch sad. He was adopted out of Tulsa Animal Welfare Shelter, but he ended up getting out of his person’s yard and when his people noticed, they didn’t care to look for him. CARE Rescue got a phone call from a nice man saying Markie was hanging out in his yard so we scooped him up and got him taken care of. Markie is 1½ years old, neutered, microchipped and up-to-date on all shots and preventative medication for fleas, parasites and heartworm.
Every encounter Markie has had has been a good one. He is BEYOND friendly, rolls over and submits to give you his belly and the kisses are almost endless! He even does that cute head-tilt when you make weird noises with your mouth. He's currently living with other dogs and gets glowing reports from his caretakers.
Markie was taken to the veterinary clinic where a healed pellet wound was discovered in his head so this boy has overcome a lot of mistreatment and hasn’t looked back or had any bad feelings about it. He just keeps moving forward. Markie will do best in a home with a 6-foot fence. Markie is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Patches is a female bi-color Seal Point Siamese mix with blue eyes, but she doesn’t look like a Siamese upon initially seeing her. Her estimated birthdate is 2/1/2009. She came into StreetCats and was adopted in 2012 and returned to us in May. She is a full-figure woman weighing 17 pounds, but she seems to get around really well and loves to be petted. Patches has a watery discharge from her right eye due to a blocked tear duct, however, her eye is fine, and nothing is needed except to clean her face one or two times a day with a warm cloth. She is very sweet, and we’re guessing she’d love to sit next to you instead of being a lap cat.
All cats have tested negative for FeLeuk/FIV and are current on rabies and FVRCP vaccinations. All StreetCats kitties have Home Again microchips implanted and are registered at no charge to the owner.
Adoption inquiries can be made at StreetCats, 60th Street and South Sheridan Road, or email cats@streetcatstulsa.org . To see more StreetCats, visit streetcatstulsa.org .
Johnny is about 2 years old but acts like a happy bouncing 3-month-old! And his fur is as soft as a pup's! Johnny is a timid little guy, loud voices and new things still frighten him, so slow and steady wins his heart. He is working on his basic commands and already walks well on leash but needs more confidence-building. He could have a doggie friend but still needs some work on proper play and sharing. If you need a friend that’ll keep you laughing, come meet Johnny! Johnny is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Bella is a retired girl available for adoption from Oklahoma Alliance for Animals; retired from a hard life that can't put a damper on her ear-to-ear smile. She's housebroken, crate trained, good with older kids, and loves short walks. She would prefer some coffee with her newspaper while relaxing on the porch at sunrise in her silk slippers. She's an easy girl, easy to maintain and loves her naps!
Tallulah is available for adoption through Sapulpa Furry Friends. She is currently in a foster home with cats, dogs and children. She is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and will be microchipped for adoption. Her adoption fee will be $50. Email sffadoptions@gmail.com for an application.
Patty is a pretty girl with beautiful eyes who is available for adoption at the Sapulpa Animal Shelter. Patty is about 6-7 months old and weighs 28 pounds. She is friendly and very excited to meet new people but will need work on her manners. Jumping, nipping (to play and out of excitement) and pulling on the leash. All of these things will get better with practice, age and basic puppy training, but she may not be a good fit for small children right off the bat.
The shelter is currently doing adoptions by appointment only. Call 918-227-2722 to schedule a meet n greet. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday-Thursday and 8 a.m. to noon Friday.
Colby is a handsome 1½-year-old ginger kitty. Colby is very standoffish and shy, but when he gets used to you and realizes you won't hurt him, he is just the sweetest! He will rub all over and talk to you, asking for pets and scratches, though he's not comfortable being picked up yet. He is still very much a baby and loves to play, so he'll definitely need play pals or he gets really bummed. Younger kitties (or even playful older kitties) would be perfect for him. Colby would also do best in a home with older or no children because he is so timid and needs lots of adjustment time.
A generous sponsor has covered half of Colby's adoption fee, so it will only take $50 to bring Colby home. This fee includes his neuter, microchip and up-to-date shots.

Casanova is available for adoption through Oklahoma Alliance for Animals. He is a 6-year-old pitbull mix. Casanova is a loving boy saved from his entire life on a chain. He adores kids, gives the best hugs and is even housebroken. His favorite thing to do is cuddle. He is the ultimate definition of a family companion.
Monkey is a very round tortie female who might be a little shy at first. Her estimated birthdate is April 2016. She will do best as a single cat in a home but is OK with dogs (were a lab mix & a chihuahua mix). She is independent, enjoys being petted, but probably not a lap cat, and may have “tortitude.”
All cats have tested negative for FeLeuk/FIV and are current on rabies and FVRCP vaccinations. All StreetCats kitties have Home Again microchips implanted and are registered at no charge to the owner.

Molly is a 2-year-old chocolate lab/sharpei mix. Molly was rescued along with her chained companion. She’s very loyal and loving, dog friendly and would make a great pet for nearly everyone. She’s laid back and easy to please. She does pretty well on a leash for being a stray.
(Old) Yeller was his name when he was on our wait list, but he isn’t old at all. He’s a red tabby, and his estimated birthdate is 6/28/2014. He weighs about 13 pounds and he loves to be petted. He is up to date on his vaccinations and he also had a dental cleaning before he came into the adoption center 2/10/2020. He is very loving, but he doesn’t like to be picked up and carried around (lots of cats don’t like to be carried around). He’s going to be a very special boy for a lucky adopter.

Oakley is a 3-year-old male mastiff mix who is available for adoption through a private foster, sponsored by Altruism Inc. rescue. He loves the company of other dogs and is good with all people, but he would do best in a home with older children. Oakley is sweet, obedient and very smart! He knows many commands and has spent time in pup training. Based on his experience, it is believed that he needs a calmer home that has routine and structure. Oakley is neutered, up to date on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on prevention. Email jlthorn824@gmail.com to inquire further.

Sammie is a female brown tabby who is just more than 1 years old (est. birthdate is 5/18/19). She was taken in by someone whose husband found her at his office, and she’s been in a separate room at their house for some time. She is very sweet, loving and playful. The rescuer couldn’t keep her due to having three senior cats and a dog that does not like cats so they kept her until she could come into StreetCats. She seems laidback, but we’re not sure how she would do with other cats and/or dogs. She does like to be up high where she can watch what is going on.

She loves car rides, belly rubs, meeting new people (she loves everyone!) and napping in the sun. Bella is good with children of all ages and some male dogs but no small dogs or cats. She is house broken and crate-trained, and just wants to be with her people and make them smile! Bella is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Sammi is a true flower girl! Every flower must be sniffed at least once by this sweet girl. Sammi knows basic commands such as sit, look, lay down and is working on shake and stay. She is a 9-month-old black mouth cur mix (we think), and she gets along with other dogs and kids and loves everyone! Sammi is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Have you ever lost your home? It can be hard when you are a senior kitty. I was adopted in 2013 and returned to StreetCats in May. I’m now 13 years old but I have a lot of life still left in me. I’m a male named Simon and my blood work tests show I’m in great shape, plus I had a dental cleaning (three teeth removed) but I’d love a new home. I’m playful, sweet, laidback, and friendly and on the large size, but if I had a home I’d run around a lot more and lose some of those unwanted pounds. We have other formerly adopted but recently returned kitties in StreetCats, so I hope you’ll come meet us and give us special homes for the rest of our lives.

Nila is a fun, outgoing and lovable pup. She is very easy to work with and a very fast learner. She loves tug-o-war and to play fetch for hours. Nila is a ball of energy and even loves to go on runs with her “person.” She even knows a few cool tricks – balance a treat on her nose and is told the command "leave it" before being allowed to grab it; fetch her leash and she puts toys up in kennel on command. Nila is waiting for her forever home but also needs a foster. Nila is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Ziggy is a red tabby and white male with an estimated birthdate of 3/1/2016. He weighs about 8 pounds and was returned to us on June 8, after being adopted a year ago with Heidi. His former owner says he was a very active kitty, curious and a ball of energy. We think he would love a playmate to rumble with. He has not been around children and dogs.

Sweetie is a 2-year-old owner surrender and she wants to tell you her story: I had a dream last night. You know, those ones that remind you of the past? I dreamed about the time I got loose from my rope and got tangled up around some trees and was stuck there all night while the fleas and ticks made a buffet out of me. I should have known better than to wander off from my short rope, but it just so hot and my skin was on fire from my sunburn. My owners found time for me the best they could, but there was this really nice neighbor lady who would come see me and give me treats and refill my water bowl. She put this necklace on me that was magical and somehow made the fleas and ticks disappear. She brought me a weird looking dog house, but turns out it had a dog door on it and I could go in there and escape the elements. The dogloo was OK, but the ground underneath it kept getting soggy. My days were pretty routine, I really just spent them trying to avoid the sun and wished I could go play. One day, the neighbor lady came over and took me off my rope and took me to the doctor's office. I woke up after that, but I suppose I'll go ahead and tell the rest of my story because my life turned out pretty great. The neighbor lady brought me to her house after the doctor's appointment, she had this super comfy bed that I could have all to myself. My skin was still sensitive, I think she could sense that. When it started to feel better she talked about a b-a-t-h. I was skeptical at first, but turns out it wasn't that bad. So now I'm what she calls an "indoor dog" and let me tell you, it's fabulous! I get to run around and do my deer hop around the yard and don't have to worry about sunburns or bugs anymore. She has other dogs that I can play with and life is great, but I wish I could have more one on one time and more "lovins." She tells me that one day my life will get even better and that I'll one day be able to lay on the couch all I want and get lots more attention. I don't quite know what she means, but she promised I'd never go back on a rope and there was some person out there that would make me feel super special. Is that you? Not to toot my own horn or anything, but I get along just fine with other dogs, cats and kids of all ages. I do like to play, and my neighbor/foster gives me a treat-stuffed toy after dinner that she said I could keep forever. I know better than to potty inside, so I just go stand by the door and I've trained her to realize that nature is calling. My only downfall I guess is that I sunburn easily, as it turns out I don't have thick hair like other dogs. Anyway, thanks for reading, I'm sure you have better things to do with your time. One thing I can promise though is I love absolutely everyone and I don't destroy human belongings like her other dogs. Don't tell her I told you any of this, she said she was trying to help me find my forever home and I don't want her to think I'm being impatient.
Sweetie is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Percy was rescued from a kennel with three other dogs during the May 2019 floods. He had spent his whole 6 years in that kennel and was a little leery of people. He has survived heartworms and the treatment and is learning to trust the world around him. He walks well on a lead, sits and comes when called. He is crate-trained and is still learning how to live in a house. Percy will need someone with patience to help him become the brave dog we all see inside! His home should be a fairly quiet one - children are fine and he would love to have a strong female dog to help him learn about life as a dog. The other dogs he was rescued with all have loving homes and we think it’s Percy’s turn! Percy is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Crosby is a big boy, but he’s young and still has lots of puppy energy. He is very sweet and loves playing with his brother and other dogs. Crosby is crate-trained and loves his treats and is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Samson is a sweet boy who had a hard start in life. He had a terrible case of Demadex when living on the streets so he didn’t have a lot of friends. His little face still shows the marks, but his smile keeps you from even noticing! He has a lot of energy and a lot of love to give! He wants to please so much. Will you give this little guy a chance? He won’t disappoint! Samson is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Cinnamon is a 9-year-old, spayed female. Cinnamon is a mature lady with lots of love left to give. While she's older, she is still very spunky and loves to play but also can relax when it’s time to settle down. She gets along well with other dogs, big and small.
Jasmine is a 4-year-old, spayed female. Jasmine was found as a stray in Tulsa. She was picked up by an OAA volunteer and taken to the vet. She was in rough shape and had heartworms. Today, Jasmine is heartworm free and ready to find a home of her own. She's a lovely, energetic girl who will make a great companion.

I am Wallace! I go by Wally though because Wallace sounds so sophisticated. I am 2 years old and potty trained! That’s a plus right? I really enjoy nice long walks outside and I like the kiddos (I have a 6- and 15-year-old at home ... Yes, they’re mine and I love them). I like to be around my people, that’s not to say I’m bad when they leave, I just get kind of anxious when that happens. I’m working on it though every day because I’m such a good boy. Not to wag my own tail but I’m a STAR prison training program graduate, and I follow commands and even though it takes some will power, I won’t even eat until you tell me to! I get along with other dogs and might even steal that warm spot on the bed when one of my people gets up in the morning (don’t judge me)! I’m ready for my forever home! Wallace is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Hi! My name is Zero Suit Samus (or Samus for short), and I'm an energetic pitbull mix who needs some love. And I really mean that. I need a family who will cuddle with me because your penalty for not giving me cuddles is to hear the cry of my people. My foster dad says that based on my crying, I must have descended from pterodactyls, but that's silly because pterodactyls don't even like peanut butter. And I looove peanut butter. And treats. And strawberries. And watermelon. And anything, really. Honestly kid, if you give me your salad, I'll eat it. Don't want your broccoli? I'll take care of your problem. See that toy? It's in my stomach now. See that puke? Well, you can have your toy back.
Like all superdogs, I have an origin story: I ran across the highway and caused a 4-car pileup that I ended up underneath. It wasn’t my best choice, but it’s still a better love story than "Twilight." I have to take daily medication now, or else I have pretty severe seizures. But I like to think of my epilepsy as my unbridled superpower that the world just isn’t ready for yet.
I'm a Tulsa native, but I'm still not a fan of the Bermuda grass around here - I get allergies in the summer, so that's something you should know. Despite this, I still love running and rolling in the grass, and if you toss me a ball, I can jump and catch it in mid-air even when it's 6-feet high. I'm not exaggerating. (Pterodactyl dogs never exaggerate.) And would you mind spraying me with a hose once in a while? I love playing in water, especially when it's coming out of a tiny hose at jet-like speeds.
But if you have another dog in the home, then forget about it because I'm a single-dog dog. A lone wolf. A rebel. I will not share my toys, I will not share my food, and I will not share my family. I do just fine around other dogs in general, but once you introduce toys or food, then I get very territorial. Can we agree that I'll be your only one?
By the way, I love kids. I don't have these problems with other humans, so don't worry about bringing me home to your young ones. I am loyal to the bone. Don't believe me? Try going for a jog with me. I will keep pace with you the entire time, just running by your hip. Need me to lick the sweat off your face after an especially hot run? Baby, that's what I'm about. I'm a good dog. My foster family says so, too. I will take care of you if you let me. I'm eager to learn, I don't catch coronaviruses, and I'm housebroken. I won't poop in your Cheerios. Unless that's one of your commands, but why would it be? Don't want your Cheerios? Just let me have them instead.
Samus is fully vaccinated, spayed, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Rocco loves to play with everyone. He is a lover and a cuddler and has a great personality. He has high energy, loves to go on walks and is a great companion on walks. He is smart, loves his treats, frisbees, rope, balls and he will bring his favorite – a tug-o-war with rope. Rocco is 2 years old and is very low-maintenance, doesn't need/want constant attention but does love to sleep with you any chance he gets to sneak in bed. He LOVES the water and using his sniffer to find ANYTHING while out walking, hiking, shopping etc. Rocco actually prefers men first over women and he’s not much of a “in your face” right out of the gate kind of dog. He is still very leery about kids, but you can't blame him as he was abused by one previously, but does ok if they just leave him alone. Older kids would be best, but it does take him awhile to warm up to them. NO CATS because if it moves quick he goes after it. He gets along great with other dogs and he is very audible when he plays so that can take some getting used to. Rocco comes with his fair share of emotional history (don’t we all?), but he is going to be the perfect fit for that perfect someone and one of his many perks is he'll make sure you're NEVER lonely in the bathroom. Rocco is a STAR Prison Training Program graduate and is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Hurley is a gentle giant at 99 pounds (not 100 pounds) who loves everyone. He currently lives with a smaller dog and two much smaller dogs and has no issues.

Hurley is possibly a mix of mastiff/pointer based on his size and coloring. He is very treat-motivated and eager to please. And Hurley would really love to find his forever family. Is that you? Hurley is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Gypsy is a beautiful Basenji mix female around 3.5 years old and she is very smart and sweet! She is crate/house-trained. This girl had a rough start in life and was adopted out previously.

My name is Mr. Heckles, but my friends just call me Heckles. I’m a big guy at about 80 pounds, but even with my size, sometimes things scare me. I’m house- and crate-trained, and I think I would do best with grownups and bigger kids. The little ones sometimes have loud voices that make me nervous. I know that if I had a family that would love me and make me feel safe, I would be the very best loyal companion for my whole life. Mr. Heckles is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
Libby is a 1.5-year-old spayed female who is available for adoption through Sapulpa Furry Friends. This pretty chica would love to celebrate Cinco de Mayo with a new family to love. Libby is energetic and playful but also loving and responds well to treats! And I might add that she is the only dog EVER in the history of my dog-photographing-experiences to willingly KEEP a hat ON! She was such a good girl! She does well on a leash and gets along with male dogs but has not done as well with other female dogs. Libby weighs 61 pounds and is up to date on her vaccinations. Her adoption fee will be $100.

Lupen is a 6-month-old mixed-breed puppy who gets along great with other dogs and loves to wrestle and play. He even already knows how to sit and lay down. After initial shyness when meeting new people, Lupen is a complete goofball. Belly rubs are his favorite kind of love, and he’s more than happy to curl up in bed with you. If you don’t mind, he will thank you with lots of kisses and wet willies. He can have energy, so he will do best with someone willing to play with him on a daily basis. Lupen is currently living with a 10-year-old girl so we feel he will do well with or without kids in the home. He is crate-trained and does best when he has a toy to entertain him. Lupen has not been cat tested, but he is interested in birds in his yard. His current foster says he is a sweet little guy and has made great progress in their home. Lupen is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.
My foster mom says I am the goodest boy. I love to be outside and play, but my favorite thing is treats! I'll do just about anything for a treat.
I sit, lay down, come when called and am learning how to shake hands. I am good with my foster pup siblings and children. I have so much love to give and can't wait to find my forever home!
