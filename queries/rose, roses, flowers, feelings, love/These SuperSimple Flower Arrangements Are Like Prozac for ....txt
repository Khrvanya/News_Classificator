Brighten your day with blooms!
A vase filled with flowers isn't just a pretty way to perk up a roomâ€”keeping fresh blooms around can actually be a benefit to your physical health. (Really, it's science !) And when you're stuck inside for the foreseeable future, they're equally valuable as a mental pick-me-up. While we love an expertly-curated centerpiece straight out of a Dutch Masters painting, a simple bouquet of readily-available flowers like tulips, lilies, or even backyard branches can have just as much of a room-brightening effect. Check out these easy-t0-make arrangements for proof that you don't need to be a professional florist to create a stunning display.
