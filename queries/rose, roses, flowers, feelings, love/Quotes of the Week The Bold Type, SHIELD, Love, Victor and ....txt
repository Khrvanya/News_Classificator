More than a dozen dramas, comedies and unscripted series made the cut for our latest compilation, which recognizes the best bon mots, zingers and one-liners from the past seven days of television.
This time around, we’ve got The Bold Type‘s sage advice for Jane’s new roommate, an anticlimactic confrontation on I May Destroy You, spectacular sass from a truly Legendary judge and some tone-deaf commentary from an Insecure onlooker (who, frankly, should have known better than to bother Kelli).
Also featured in this week’s roundup: double doses of Love, Victor ( read finale post mortem ) and Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ( read post mortem ), plus sound bites from Burden of Truth, Dirty John, One Day at a Time, Penny Dreadful and more.
