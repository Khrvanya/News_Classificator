A resurfaced video shows Jimmy Kimmel laughing as Megan Fox talks about being sexualized at 15, and fans are saying she 'deserved better'
A video of Megan Fox's 2009 interview on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" resurfaced on Twitter on Saturday.
During the interview, Fox said "Bad Boys II" director Michael Bay had her wear a bikini, cowboy hat, and six-inch heels as an extra when she was 15.
"That's really a microcosm of how all our minds work but some of us have the decency to repress those thoughts," Kimmel responds, prompting laughter from the audience.
After watching the video, people called Kimmel's behavior "disgusting" and said the actress deserved more from Hollywood.
Director Michael Bay and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel are being criticized after Megan Fox 's 2009 interview on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" resurfaced on Twitter on Saturday.
During the interview, Fox told Kimmel about her first time working with Bay as an extra on the 2003 film "Bad Boys II" when she was 15 years old.
She recalled wearing a stars-and-stripes bikini, a red cowboy hat, and six-inch heels — an outfit that she said Bay approved himself.Advertisement
Because she was 15 at the time and couldn't legally hold a drink or sit at the bar during the movie's club scene, Bay came up with an alternative plan.
"His solution to that problem was to then have me dancing underneath a waterfall getting soaking wet. At 15. I was in 10th grade," she said. "That's sort of a microcosm of how Bay's mind works."
In response, Kimmel told her, "Well, that's really a microcosm of how all our minds work. Some of us have the decency to repress those thoughts and pretend that they don't exist."

After watching the interview 11 years later, people were shocked at Kimmel's reaction, saying that it's unacceptable for an adult to make jokes about sexualizing a minor. Several called for an apology from the late-night host.
