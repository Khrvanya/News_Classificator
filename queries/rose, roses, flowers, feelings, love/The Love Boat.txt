Pick any episode of "THE LOVE BOAT", and have IMDB.com launched on your computer. Be prepared to spend several hours looking up each actor who appears in that episode. You'll be amazed at the actors who became big in the late part of the 1970's and early 1980's who turn up. I was surprised to see actors who worked together in ONE show, turn up together on "THE LOVE BOAT" There's a classic episode where Florence Henderson, and Robert Reed, of "Brady Bunch" fame, appear together, but NOT in the same story line. They pass each other in a buffet line, and do "the classic double-take". Clever writing, on someone's part.
Plus, many stars from the past got a shot at some screen time, courtesy of "THE LOVE BOAT".
++POSSIBLE SPOLIERS!++ The format for each show was painfully similar. In the first few moments we meet the passengers. Usually, there were three stories that we followed thru the cruise. By the second commercial break, some sort of problem or trouble appears in each tale, and we see the folks involved work thru their issues, and after the last commercial, everybody disembarks with a smile, and the happy Pacific Princess crew have a clever line to close the show. Some episodes were a bit different, but not by much.
This, and "Fantasy Island" were classic escapist fare, and did the ABC television network well in getting folks to stay home on Saturday nights, when these shows aired, back-to-back.
