Summer is practically here, and those with their own pools are lucky enough to have a place to cool down. However, if you’re feeling a little timid about dipping into chilly water, these solar-powered flowers are exactly what you need. Not only do they look great—similar to beautiful floating lily pads—but they also use the natural heat of the sun to heat up your pool.
Available as packs of 12 , the Solar Pool Flowers come in three different color options—black, blue, or a rainbow-hued set. Each individual flower measures 22″ in diameter, is lightweight, impact resistant, and made from recyclable plastic. Simply toss them into your pool and enjoy the temperature difference. As the sun hits them, they begin to generate heat.
“Such a more eye pleasing way of warming up my pool,” one reviewer wrote. “I love how easy it is to move them around to where the sun is on the water. I also love how I don’t have to worry about a dog or child falling into a solar blanket and getting trapped. Can definitely tell a difference with the water temperature under the flowers. Will be getting more for sure!”

They look just like floating lily pads!
