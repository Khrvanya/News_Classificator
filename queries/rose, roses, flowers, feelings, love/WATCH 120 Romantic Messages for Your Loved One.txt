"I lov'd thee from the earliest dawn, / When first I saw thy beauty's ray,/ And will, until life's eve comes on, / And beauty's blossom fades away; / And when all things go well with thee, / With smiles and tears remember me. / I'll love thee when thy morn is past, / And wheedling gallantry is o'er, / When youth is lost in age's blast, / And beauty can ascend no more. / And when life's journey ends with thee, / O, then look back and think of me." ‚Äî "Early Affection," George Moses Horton
"There's no doubt in my mind / a Southern girl was born / for a man to hold, / to sway as one / to the sound of country music, / in his arms he embraces pure gold. / A man is born to love a Southern girl / blond hair, black hair, brown hair, / straight or curled, / a man is born to love a Southern girl." ‚Äî "Born to Love a Southern Girl," Steven S.

"Love arrives / and in its train come ecstasies / old memories of pleasure / ancient histories of pain. / Yet if we are bold, / love strikes away the chains of fear / from our souls. / We are weaned from our timidity / In the flush of love's light / we dare be brave / And suddenly we see / that love costs all we are / and will ever be. / Yet it is only love / which sets us free." ‚Äî "Touched by an Angel," Maya Angelou
"My monkey-wrench man is my sweet patootie; / the lover of my life, my youth and age. / My heart belongs to him and to him only; / the children of my flesh are his and bear his rage / Now grown to years advancing through the dozens / the honeyed kiss, the lips of wine and fire / fade blissfully into the distant years of yonder / but all my days of Happiness and wonder / are cradled in his arms and eyes entire. / They carry us under the waters of the world / out past the starposts of a distant planet / And creeping through the seaweed of the ocean / they tangle us with ropes and yarn of memories / where we have been together, you and I." ‚Äî "Love Song for Alex, 1979," Margaret Walker
"I had not thought of violets late, / The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet / In wistful April days, when lovers mate / And wander through the fields in raptures sweet. / The thought of violets meant florists' shops, / And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine; / And garish lights, and mincing little fops / And cabarets and soaps, and deadening wines. / So far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed, / I had forgot wide fields; and clear brown streams; / The perfect loveliness that God has made,‚Äî / Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams. / And now‚Äîunwittingly, you've made me dream / Of violets, and my soul's forgotten gleam." ‚Äî "Sonnet," Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson
