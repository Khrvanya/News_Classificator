The hanging baskets have been suspended from lampposts around Romford, including outside The Bull in Market Place
Romford Business Improvement District (BID) has provided 60 hanging baskets of fresh flowers across the town centre, in line with many businesses reopening this week.
Baskets have been suspended from lampposts in South Street, The Brewery Walkway, High Street and the Market Place.
The flowers will remain in bloom until the Autumn.
Romford BID will also be visiting every BID member this week to present them with a letter and welcome back pack from the director, Julie Frost.
The BID Ambassadors are returning to work today to provide guidance for visitors in Romford on how to shop in a ‘Covid-secure’ way.
Tracey, Carrie and Peter will be on and around the streets of the town, in a new uniform, every day between 9am and 6pm.
BID Director, Julie Frost said “As Romford comes back to life, I want the BID to be there on the streets of RM1 helping to banish the lockdown gloom and to inspire confidence in our town once again.
“Our new hanging baskets not only bring a splash of colour to the place, they are a metaphor for regrowth. Let’s make Romford great again.”
