Detroit Pistons point guard Derrick Rose dropped out of the NBA’s Skills Challenge because of his adductor strain, according to Eric Woodyard of ESPN .
Rose didn’t play against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday and won’t play on Wednesday versus the Phoenix Suns either:

Rose is averaging 18.5 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 44 games for the Pistons this season. He’s shooting 49.8 percent from the field, 31.5 percent from beyond the arc and 85.9 percent from the free-throw line.
Rose is garnering trade interest with the NBA trade deadline coming up. Right now, the Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams we know that have interest in the former MVP. The Los Angeles Clippers called the Pistons about Rose too, but that was just exploratory talks.
It’s unknown how long Rose will be out for the Pistons. Given his injury history, the Pistons will surely play it safe with the three-time All-Star. Rose has undergone four knee surgeries, one eye procedure and one elbow surgery since winning his MVP award with the Chicago Bulls back in 2011.
Rose, 31, has career averages of 18.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.6 assists.
