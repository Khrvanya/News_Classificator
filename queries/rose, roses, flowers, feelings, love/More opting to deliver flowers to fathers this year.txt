JOHOR BARU: While flowers are more commonly associated with Mothers Day, florists are seeing an increase in flower sales for Fathers Day.
Most are for home deliveries from those who are unable to return to be with their fathers on this special day.
Florist Jun Lim, 33 said most of her delivery orders were from those working in Singapore, who were unable to return home.
“So they are resorting to sending flowers and chocolates, which are typically more in demand during Mothers Day,” she said.
She added that her customers also had an option of sending a package which included flowers, chocolates and cake for Fathers Day.
Flower and gift shop owner Audrey Tan, 37, said she had received more than 35 home delivery orders for Fathers Day as of yesterday, which was comparatively higher than in previous years.
“Most customers prefer to have the gifts sent to their parents’ house directly as it would be more of a surprise that way,” she said.
Besides those working in Singapore, Lim said she also had customers ordering home deliveries from other states.
“Although interstate travel is allowed, some are choosing not to visit their parents yet to avoid the risk of transmitting Covid-19,” she said
Florist Eunice Ching Yok Lian, 46, said that apart from flowers, she also sent bouquets of other items, including durians and bottled herbal drinks.
“Since Fathers Day falls during the durian season this year, we have decided to come out with durian flower bouquets.“However, it was sold out even before Fathers Day arrived,” she said.
She said this was the first time she used durians with floral arrangement.
Flower sales for Fathers Day, especially those opting for home deliveries, were slightly higher this year, she said, with sunflowers being the most popular.
