Julien’s Auctions president Darren Julien said in a statement: “In this new world of social distancing and isolation, music and the arts has brought us together and given us hope and salvation from the despair and loss that we’ve all felt these last months.
“We thank Bill Wyman for his generous offering and are calling on all artists from film, music, sports, fashion and more to look into their closets and archives and donate an iconic item or two to this urgent initiative.”
“Event cancellations are at unprecedented levels and the situation therefore requires an unprecedented response. Many people in the industry are now in crisis, not knowing what the future holds or having to deal with dire commercial realities,” Recording Academy chair and interim CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said at the time.
“We are asking the entire industry to stand with us to support the musicians, artists and professionals who are the bedrock and the future of our music community.”
