We are thrilled to present Modern Love: The Podcast , a new weekly series we’ve been working on with WBUR , Boston’s NPR News station, to bring some of our favorite Modern Love essays to life.
The first two episodes, available to stream below, are “ A Craigslist ‘Missed Connection’ Lure ” read by the Broadway actress and musician Lauren Molina, and “ Just One Last Swirl Around the Bowl ” read by the award-winning actor Jason Alexander.
You’ll be able to listen to a new episode of Modern Love: The Podcast each Thursday at WBUR.org, NYTimes.com and on iTunes , Stitcher or the podcast app of your choice.
Each episode will feature a reading by familiar voices, including Judd Apatow, Sarah Paulson, Michael Shannon and January Jones, followed by a conversation led by the host, Meghna Chakrabarti, with the essayist and me about what’s happened since and how the writer feels about the story now.
If you want to catch up on past Modern Love columns, have a look here . And find us on Facebook for the latest Modern Love updates, audio or otherwise.
We hope you enjoy it. Thanks for listening.
