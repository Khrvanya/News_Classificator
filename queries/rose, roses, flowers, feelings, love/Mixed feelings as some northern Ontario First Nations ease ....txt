Some First Nations in northeastern Ontario have re-opened their borders as COVID-19 numbers drop, others are keeping checkpoints up but allowing more people to travel through them.
M'Chigeeng was stopping traffic on provincial highways in and out of the Manitoulin Island community until last week.
No one from the First Nation has been made available for interviews, despite repeated requests from the CBC.
Lisa Corbiere-Addison, a M'Chigeeng citizen who owns a garage in the community, is unhappy that the checkpoints have been replaced with signs telling drivers not to stop in the First Nation.

"It's already had a great affect on every business here in M'Chigeeng. People feel they're breaking the law when they stop at our businesses," she says.
Mattagami First Nation still has a border checkpoint on the access road into the community of about 200 off of Highway 144.
Councillor Jennifer Constant says at first all visitors were turned away and families were only permitted one trip out of the community per week to Sudbury or Timmins.
