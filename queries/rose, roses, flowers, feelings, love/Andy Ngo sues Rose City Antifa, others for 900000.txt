Lawsuit centers on alleged attack by Portland anti-fascists during a milkshake protest in June, 2019.
A Portland man has filed a new lawsuit against the black-clad anti-fascists called antifa who allegedly attacked him for documenting a milkshake-themed protest in Portland last year.
In the 11 months since the events of June 29, 2019, Andy Ngo has arguably become antifa's Public Enemy No. 1 and a cause celebre in conservative circles for his articles and online posts of videos showing street brawling here and across the country.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, June 4, in Multnomah County court, Ngo seeks at least $900,000 in damages for assault, battery, emotional distress and racketeering by those who acted to "suppress Ngo's journalism through intimidation and violence," and for "ongoing neurological and health issues."
"Antifa is an openly extremist movement with the training and intent of destabilizing this country and overthrowing our constitution," Ngo said during a live-streamed press conference. "The protection of foolish politicians and the media have emboldened this movement to carry out unprecedented terrorist attacks."
Listed as defendants in the lawsuit are Rose City Antifa , an "unincorporated association," Corbyn Belyea, alleged Rose City Anitfa member Benjamin Bolen, local activist John Hacker, Madison Lee Allen and Joseph Christian Evans, who the lawsuit says lives under the Burnside Bridge, as well as 50 unnamed parties.
