A ROADSIDE memorial at the spot where two young people lost their lives has been inundated with flowers and photos.
The memorial was erected in honour of Chloe McArthur and her boyfriend, Connor Andersen, who lost their lives on the highway at Torbanlea.
Chloe's mum Becky McArthur said another memorial would be created in Maryborough for those who couldn't access the highway.
Ms McArthur said she had told Fraser Coast councillor Daniel Sanderson plaques were being created for Chloe and Connor.
The plaques would be placed somewhere in Maryborough and would provide another place for the people who loved Chloe and Connor to mourn.
