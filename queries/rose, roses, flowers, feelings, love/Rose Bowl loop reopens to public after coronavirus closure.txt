The loop around the Rose Bowl has reopened.
The 3.1-mile loop around Rose Bowl Stadium reopened Wednesday morning after a weeks-long closure prompted by safety concerns over the coronavirus.
The City Council made the move earlier this week following an outcry from visitors asking for the loop — a draw for walkers, joggers and bicyclists — to be reopened, said Pasadena spokeswoman Lisa Derderian.  The reopening came days after Los Angeles County reopened trails, parks and golf courses , including Brookside golf course, adjacent to the Rose Bowl.
The City Council also moved to reopen hiking trails in the nearby foothills.
The Rose Bowl loop was closed in late March over public health and safety concerns after empty water bottles, gloves and masks littered the area. Derderian said the path would be opened for a monthlong test, as officials assess whether users are following physical distancing and other rules.
“We’ll modify the loop as necessary” to abide by restrictions, she said, “whether it be adding more staff or alternating the traffic variations.”
Face coverings are required, and visitors are instructed to maintain a six-foot buffer with others using the pathway.
To prevent overcrowding, the loop is closed to vehicle traffic, and only one parking lot is open. Visitors can park in Lot I, which holds up to 1,400 vehicles, and must leave after 90 minutes. Picnicking and congregating in front of the stadium are not allowed.
Several hundred people have visited since the area reopened Wednesday morning, Derderian said. The public can use the track from 6 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
About 400 people are tested daily for coronavirus infection at the Rose Bowl, one of Los Angeles County’s testing sites. Crossing guards, safety monitors and signs will direct residents seeking a test to a different parking destination.
More than 550 Pasadena residents have been infected by COVID-19, and 65 people have died. Over 33,000 people have been infected with the virus in all of L.A. County.
