Hypnotic Macro Timelapse Combines Flowers, Ice, and Ink for Stunning Results
Montreal-based art director Christopher Dormoy has created one of the most hypnotic timelapses we’ve ever seen. It’s called “Black Ice,” and it combines ink, ice, flowers, and creative macro photography filming techniques to produce something truly stunning.
“Black Ice is a personal project I worked on during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement,” says Dormoy. “I wanted to play with ice, flower and ink and see what kind of universe I can created with the macro and motion timelapse technique. I spent many hours to observe and experiment the ice and how it react with liquids like ink but also, oil, paint and soap. Some effects are hypnotic and surprising.”
