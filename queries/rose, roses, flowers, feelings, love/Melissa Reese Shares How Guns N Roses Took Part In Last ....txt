“Dropping today! This was such an amazing game to be a part of!!! I remember my first day coming into the studio to work on music for it – I was so sick with strep throat but I was so excited!!! FFwd what, 5 years?!? (and many more amazing times) later and here it is!!! Neil Druckmann and Ashley Johnson – you guys own hard.
I’m so honored and grateful that I got to work with you both, and through this now call you homies.. Scott Hanau and everyone else I worked with on the Sony side (you too Pete Scatturro 🥰- You are the reason I met any of these fools!!!)
Thank you so so much and you rule. Thanks for believing in me and my ability to elevate. This journey was rad. Gah!!! V exciting 😁.”
