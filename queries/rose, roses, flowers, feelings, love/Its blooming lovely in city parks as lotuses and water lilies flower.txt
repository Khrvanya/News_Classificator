This year's flowering is about a week later than last year due to continuous rainfall and a sudden drop in temperature, said Liu Amei, a greenery engineer at the Shanghai Guyi Garden.
The right temperature for lotus growth is between 25 and 32 degrees, and the best temperature during the budding phase is above 25 degrees for at least 14 consecutive days, said Liu.
A sudden drop in temperature will affect the budding of the flower. The lotus prefers sunny weather to bloom.
