“What hasn’t been done yet?” is Sprout Home's main mission. The company prides themselves on being floral designers offering custom-order-arrangements, floral designs for events, commercial styling, weekly floral subscriptions, and “just because” gifts. Sprout Home is exclusive to the Chicago and New York City areas and offers workshop classes in both cities on terrariums, floral design, kokedama, and botanical design.
