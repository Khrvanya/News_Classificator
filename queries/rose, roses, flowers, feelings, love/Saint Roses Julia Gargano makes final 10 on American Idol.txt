Julia Gargano sings "New York State of Mind" from her Staten Island home.
During Sunday night’s episode, the College of Saint Rose senior sang a soulful rendition of  Billy Joel’s “New York State of Mind” from her Staten Island home.
Due to COVID-19, the singing competition has gone with a “stay-at-home” format for the last few episodes. According to The Washington Post, the show's producers sent each contestant identical recording equipment, along with a ring light. Producers also met with the contestants via Zoom to help them set up the best performance spaces in their respective homes.

The performances are done over Zoom and following each, judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan give live feedback. For Gargano, it's nearly all been positive.
“That was maybe one of the best performances of the season,” Perry said after Gargano’s “New York State of Mind” performance.
“I’m speechless. That might be my most favorite performance of the year thus far,” Bryan said.
In previous weeks, the judges also praised her stage presence and style.
“We have a lot of singers in the world, very few stylists. Stylists make careers. That was an amazing performance in your style,” Richie said after Gargano’s performance of Christina Perri’s “Human” last week.
The next episode, which will reveal the top seven contestants, airs on Sunday at 8 p.m.
