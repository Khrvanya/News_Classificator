The family of four were photographed for the first time on Wednesday, carrying their adorable babies out on a walk.
Wiig ignited rumors she was starting a family when she thanked her own mother for 'preparing me to be a mom myself' during a buzz-making Mother's Day sketch on SNL last month.

Byrne and Wiig famously worked together on Paul Feig's Bridesmaids in 2011, and the pair of actresses have remained friendly since.
Reflecting on the fact that it's been almost ten years since that star-making performance, Rose said 'It doesn’t feel like it was that long ago.
'I remember just having an incredible time' she continued. 'It was one of those seminal points in your life, doing a really special project, not knowing it would go on to be so beloved and such a success.'
'But I cannot believe it’s been 10 years!' the Spy actress added.
As for Rose herself, she's quite happy to welcome Kristen to the mom club, since she has two tots herself.
The Australian-born Byrne is mother to sons Rocco, four, and Rafa, two, whom she shares with her partner Bobby Cannavale.
