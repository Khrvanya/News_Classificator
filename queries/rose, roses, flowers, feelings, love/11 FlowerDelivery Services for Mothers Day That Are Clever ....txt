If you’re not able to hug your mom IRL this Mother’s Day, you can still show her you care with a fresh bouquet (or, dare we suggest, a potted plant!) that is worthy of her greatness. No two mother figures are alike, so doesn’t yours deserve better than a standard spray of roses? Plus, it’s safe to say that this Mother’s Day will be unlike any before it, and it’s likely she needs a creative pick-me-up more than ever. Whether she’s into classic fresh-cut blooms straight from the farm or dramatically styled centerpieces, we have 11 flower-delivery services that will help you find the perfect flora for her.
With COVID-19 delivery restrictions in place and many florists closed for the time being, you may want to play it safe and order well in advance, and be sure to check delivery times to guarantee that your gift will arrive by Sunday, May 10.
For the design-forward mom, UrbanStems has all of the spectacular spring classics (peonies, ranunculus, roses) as well as a selection of modern dried and dyed stems. Added bonus: Clever readers can get 15 percent off and free shipping with code Clevermomsday.
