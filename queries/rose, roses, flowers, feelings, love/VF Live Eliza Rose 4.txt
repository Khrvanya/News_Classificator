Records that speak truth to power, and give hope.
In VF Live – our favourite collectors take you inside their homes and record shops, for intimate selects and mixes.
Londoner Eliza Rose has spent over a decade working at her local record shop Flashback, acquiring a formidable collection along the way – sourced from the racks and beyond.
In Rose’s fourth VF Live set, she explores records that speak truth to power, as well as those that have uplifted her during recent weeks.
“The last few weeks have been very harrowing and I have picked tracks that have given me food for thought as well as hope. These are tracks that have been soundtracking the last few weeks for me while I have been thinking and protesting and supporting the black lives matter movement. I would like to dedicate this mix to Rashan Charles.
