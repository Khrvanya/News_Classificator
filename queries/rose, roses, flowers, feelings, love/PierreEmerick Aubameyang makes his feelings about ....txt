It read: "Once more Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang led Arsenal (and Man City) in interceptions. He did everything asked of him on defence but didn't have the guile behind him.
Aubameyang came across the tweet, despite not being tagged in it, and gave it a 'like' as if to say he completely agrees.
Gabon international Aubameyang recently revealed in a frank interview with Telefoot that he won't sign fresh terms with Arsenal unless he's convinced the club will be competitive next season.

Mikel Arteta remains confident he is on top of the situation, though.
"We have had many discussions with Pierre, his family and his agent, and I am pretty positive we can find the right agreement for all parties," Arteta said recently.
"I think it's our responsibility to make him feel this is the right next step in his career. In order to do that he needs to feel valued.

"I think he needs to feel he belongs to us and we want him, and then he really needs to believe we can take this club forward the way we want to and that he's going to be a key player to do that.
"At the moment I'm extremely happy with how he's been performing and behaving, I think I have a really good relationship with him and we can discuss face to face a lot of things. As far as I'm aware he is very happy at the club."
