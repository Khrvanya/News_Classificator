The generic name is derived from the Latin prefix “angi” (referring to angiosperm) and the genus Mordella Linnaeus. The specific name is derived from Latin “Burmitina,” referring to the mineralogical name of Burmese amber.
NIGP171315 ( Fig. 1 ), a complete beetle with left side visible but its right side covered by abundant microbubbles. A thrip is near the maxillary palpi of the beetle on the left side.
Mid-Cretaceous (∼99 Ma); Burmese amber, from the Hukawng Valley, Kachin State, Myanmar.
Body small, with pronotum and elytra with wrinkles or ridges dorsally; antennae serrate; mesotibiae and metatibiae without any kind of ridge including subapical one; pygidium not well developed, shorter than 1/2 of last abdominal sternite.
Body strongly convex, wedge-shaped, widest near base of prothorax, slightly narrowed anteriorly and posteriorly ( Fig. 1 A and B ). Body length 4.25 mm; ratio of body length to greatest body width 3:2. Head length 0.51 mm, large, transverse, strongly declined, with mouthparts directly posteriorly; compound eyes finely faceted and glabrous. Occipital region wide, surface with wrinkles and hairs, matching perfectly with anterior edge of pronotum. Antennae comparatively short, with 7 visible antennomeres, obviously serrate ( Fig. 1D ), covered with hairs. Maxillary palp length 0.38 mm; apical maxillary palpomere length 0.18 mm, securiform, strongly enlarged.
Pronotum length 1.11 mm, slightly narrowed anteriorly, widest posteriorly, as wide as elytra at base, lateral margin slightly curved; pronotum disk with ridges and covered by short and dense recumbent hairs ( Fig. 1C ). Elytra length 2.46 mm, ∼2.5 times as long as pronotum, covering all abdominal segments, with slight surface relief, gradually curving up to apex proximity; integuments covered with fine hairs. Forelegs simple, tibiae slender. Mesotibiae and mesotarsi simple, long and slender. Metaepistena long, rectangular. Metacoxae greatly enlarged with rounded posterior margin, extending laterally to meet elytra, widely rounded at posterior margin; trochanter oblique. Metafemora length 0.80 mm, laterally compressed and greatly expanded, more than 4 times wider than mesofemora. Metatibiae length 0.74 mm, blade shaped, about same length as metafemora with obliquely truncated apexes; metatibiae without any kind of ridge including subapical one; apical margin of hind tibiae bearing comb-like setae; ventral side of metatibiae and metatarsomeres with fine spine-like setae; apical spurs on metatibiae absent. Metatarsi laterally compressed, comparatively sturdy, with comb-like setae on apical margin and apical spurs on posterior margin, spiny on inner margins ( Fig. 1F ); length of four metatarsomeres 0.50 mm, 0.30 mm, 0.18 mm, 0.16 mm, ratio 5:3:2:2. Claws small and bicleft. Abdomen distinctly narrowed posteriorly, with 5 free ventrites. Ventrites 1−5 length 0.16 mm, 0.16 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.12 mm, 0.26 mm, ratio 1:1:1:1:2 ( Fig. 1E ). Hairs present on abdomen, slightly elongated between sternites. Pygidium very short, 0.18 mm long.
A. burmitina can be attributed to the subfamily Mordellinae by the following characters: wedge-shaped body, enlarged last segment of maxillary palpi; metacoxae greatly enlarged forming a rounded plate; metafemora expanded and well developed; and pygidium very short. It resembles Primaevomordellida burmitina Bao et al. 2019 from Burmese amber ( 46 ) in the absence of ridge on metatibiae and metatarsi but differs from the latter in having a short pointed pygidium. It is also similar to Mediumiuga sinespinis Peris & Ruzzier, 2013 from late Albian Spanish amber ( 47 ) in having a very short pygidium and ventrally spiny metatibiae and metatarsi but differs from the latter in the absence of ridge on metatibiae and metatarsi.
There are at least 62 pollen grains (from only the visible left side of the beetle) in the amber in total, of which 24 pollen grains aggregate into two small clusters near the abdominal end of the mordellid ( Fig. 2A ). Pollen grains in the amber are retitricolpate and highly uniform in morphology ( Fig. 2 B, C, and H ). The shape of the grain is approximately oblate spheroidal, 25.56 μm (30.95−22.08 μm) × 16.49 μm (20.68−13.93 μm) in equatorial view (based on measurement of the 27 best preserved pollen grains; SI Appendix, Table S1 ). The colpi are long, wide, and deep and extend to the pole. The exine is moderately thick, ∼1 μm. The lumina are small, evenly spaced, and ∼0.5 μm in diameter. The pollen clump shape is irregular, and the pollen grains are well preserved ( Fig. 2 F and G ), indicating that they are natural floral remains rather than coprolites ( 48 ). These pollen grains can be confidently attributed to the eudicot monophyletic group (true dicotyledons), members of which are distinguished from all other angiosperms by their tricolpate pollen structure ( 49 , 50 ). We did not assign the pollen to a taxon given the nature of this microscopic method conducted within amber.
The amber piece came from an amber mine near Noije Bum Village, Danai Town in northern Myanmar. The U-Pb dating of zircons from the volcanoclastic matrix of the amber gave a maximum age of 98.8 ± 0.6 million years ( 51 ), which is also supported by the ammonite trapped in the amber ( 52 ). The specimen (NIGP171315) is deposited in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology (NIGPAS), Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Photographs were taken using a Zeiss AXIO Zoom V16 microscope system at the State Key Laboratory of Paleobiology and Stratigraphy, NIGPAS. Incident and transmitted light were used simultaneously in most instances. Each image was digitally stacked with 40−50 individual focal planes, produced with the software Helicon Focus 6 ( https://www.heliconsoft.com/ ) for better illustration of the 3-dimensional (3D) structures.
Photomicrographs with green background were taken using a CLSM Zeiss LSM710 system with laser wavelength 488 nm (Laser module LGK 7812 ML5) at the State Key Laboratory of Paleobiology and Stratigraphy, NIGPAS. Based on the diameter and thickness of amber specimen, 2 objectives (“Plan-Neofluar” 20×/0.50 M27 and “Plan-Apochromat” 63×/1.40 Oil DIC M27) were applied. AxioVision 4.0 modules with the software AxioVision Rel. 4.8.2 were used to produce high-resolution images.
To 3-dimensionally reconstruct the beetle, we scanned the fossil at the micro-CT laboratory of NIGPAS, using a 3D X-ray microscope (3D-XRM), Zeiss Xradia 520 versa. Unlike conventional micro-CT, which relies on maximum geometric magnification and a flat panel detector to achieve high resolution, 3D-XRM uses charge-coupled device (CCD)-based objectives to achieve higher spatial resolution. Based on the size of the fossil specimen, a CCD and 4× objective was used, providing isotropic voxel sizes of 3.43 μm with the help of geometric magnification. During the scan, the acceleration voltage for the X-ray source was 50 kV (power 4W), and a thin filter (LE3) was used to avoid beam hardening artifacts. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, 3,000 projections over 360° were collected, and the exposure time for each projection was 5 s. Volume data processing was performed using software VGStudio Max (version 3.0, Volume Graphics, Heidelberg, Germany).
