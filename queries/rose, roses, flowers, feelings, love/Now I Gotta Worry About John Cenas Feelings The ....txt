Undertaker has had the biggest matches in sports entertainment. One match everyone wished to see was The Phenom taking on John Cena on the grandest stage of them all. While most of the WWE universe was spellbound over Taker’s win, his daughter wasn’t really a fan of how things turned out.
In the latest chapter of his documentary ‘The Last Ride’, Undertaker speaks about the incidents that took place right after his win against Cena. His daughter Kaia was happy with her father winning but also disappointed. She idolizes John Cena and watching him lose was displeasing.
“The matches that I’ve won, she’s actually fallen asleep and missed. So she’s only stayed awake for the ones that I have lost really. I think she was excited to know that I can still win a match,” Undertaker said.
