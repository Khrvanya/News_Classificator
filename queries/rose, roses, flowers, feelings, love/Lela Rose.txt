Lela Rose knows how to brighten even the gloomiest, grayest afternoon of New York Fashion Week. Instead of staging a by-the-book presentation in an empty gallery space, she invited editors and buyers into a tiny, flower-filled shop in the West Village, which is functioning as a Lela Rose pop-up throughout the week. In addition to selling pieces from her new spring collection, she’ll host cocktail classes, community events, and sell actual bouquets of roses and peonies and tulips. Florals are a beloved motif for Rose; she even baked shortbread cookies pressed with pansies and daffodils to match her fall 2020 collection. In most cases, her new florals felt looser and a bit more spontaneous than in the past, particularly a black long-sleeve gown with gentle padding at the shoulders and painterly ferns and leaves scattered throughout. A button-front dress with bluebells and poppies was even styled a bit more freely with wide-leg trousers; similarly, a more geometric daisy jacquard cocktail dress was grounded by a black turtleneck and chunky boots.
Rose will always have a market for her pretty, flowery dresses, so the easier silhouettes and modern styling tweaks were what felt new here. A single-sleeve powder blue midi looked cool with flat black boots, and she even cut a great black suit you could dress up or down: The long belted blazer had a subtle double-layer effect through the body and hit just past the hips; the model wore it with matching narrow trousers and white boots. Suits have been everywhere this week, and while this one had the requisite clean lines, it didn’t look trendy or masculine. The same woman who loves Rose’s florals and brights would likely be just as into the feminine shape and tiny rows of crystals above each pocket; those touches of flair will stand out from the severe, oversized options elsewhere come September.
