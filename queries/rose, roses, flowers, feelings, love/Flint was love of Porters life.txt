TV presenter Gail Porter has said that the late singer Keith Flint was the love of her life.
The Prodigy frontman, who died last year aged 49, dated Porter between 1999 and 2000.
She told the BBC's Grounded With Louis Theroux podcast that it was "terrible" what happened to him.
Porter said: "Keith was the love of my life, I absolutely loved him, I miss him."
She said their relationship began when they went on a blind date.
"I was single and we went out and we did not stop laughing for the entire evening and then practically that was us together, almost for two years," Porter said.
"The good thing was, he didn't really talk about work, I didn't really talk about work, we would just go and do fun things."
She said that the pair later went to the Maldives together when she had to go and stay there for work.
"He had a few wobbles but by the end of it, he was swimming every day, we were going to the gym and both of us, our mental health was just so fantastic," she said.
"Of course everyone is going to be extremely happy if you're in the Maldives, we were so lucky and then when we got back I said, 'Right, I'm going to go back to work and you go back to work'.
"He just didn't get his mind back into things properly. And he was going that way and I was like, we need to keep our minds positive and it just didn't work that way.
"He was on a downer, I was trying to work my hardest, so it was a shame."
She added that things between them "just seemed to work" because "Keith had his issues, like I had my issues".
"But I always thought there was going to be that moment when we are going to have bad times at different times and it kind of worked that way unfortunately," she said.
Grounded With Louis Theroux is available on BBC Sounds every Monday and BBC Radio 4 every Wednesday at 8pm.
