The brunette beauty spent years caring for her mother who became disabled following a heart attack and stroke.
The Birmingham native explained how their tragic passings made her 'grow up really fast' as she opened up about dealing with grief during the recording of her PrettyLittleThing podcast episode.
Double loss: The glamour model, 25, whose mother Christine died aged 64 in June last year, previously said her parents' death made her 'grow up faster'
She said: 'I've lost both of my parents, my dad cancer and my mum had a heart attack which caused a stroke when I was 17 and I was left as her carer as she was left disabled.
'I was caring for her for so many years, about 7 years,' explained the social media star.
Demi then went into detail about the impact the death of her parents had on her and how she aims to help others experiencing the same thing.
She explained: 'Then my dad passed away with cancer and then my mum then sadly passed away 7 months after him with a stomach infection, and it just made me grow up really fast and be really really strong about things.
'And I think if I can inspire people by talking about grief, then you know if they can relate to me and they can understand it a little bit and I can help them then that's important to me.
After experiencing the loss of both of her parents, Demi admitted: 'I've gone through a lot, so I can talk on it.
'I feel like nothing can really affect me now, nothing can really make me feel a certain way - I've gone through it all.'
Discussing how she copes with the loss of loved ones, she said: 'It's just part of life's plan and you've got to be strong about it,' adding: 'I couldn't have prayed for better friends.'
