Life is hard, stressful, fast-paced and can sometimes be overwhelming. That’s why EastIdahoNews.com is partnering with MorningStar Senior Living of Idaho Falls to bring you Life Lessons.
We’re asking MorningStar residents to share gems of wisdom every Tuesday with us. Some of their answers will make you laugh, some may make you cry, some may even change your life.
With the spread of COVID-19, we are currently unable to interview the wise folks face-to-face at Morningstar so we’re taking a look back at what some in the past have told us.
We first met Beverly Yule and Dave Rose back in January. They were married last October after meeting at MorningStar. Their former spouses both passed away and Dave approached Beverly as she was playing bingo. He asked if she wanted to go to a baseball game with him. They had a great time and were married a few months later.
Beverly and Dave have learned a lot in their lives and they shared some of their lessons in the video player above.
