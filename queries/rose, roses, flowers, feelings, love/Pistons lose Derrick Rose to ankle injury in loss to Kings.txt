Derrick Rose suffered a right ankle injury during Sunday's game between the Pistons and Kings.
As soon as Derrick Rose went down with an ankle injury, the Pistons' fast start screeched to a halt. The result was a Kings' comeback win and more uncertainty for an already shorthanded Detroit team.
Rose, who put up nine points, three rebounds and two assists in just nine minutes of action on Sunday, did not return after injuring his right ankle during the second quarter. The Pistons promptly saw a double-digit lead dwindle before falling 106-100 at Sacramento.
There is no immediate timetable for Rose's return.
“We’re not sure yet. We saw him (after the game) and he’s walking around and he’s out of the boot,” Casey told reporters after the game . “He was moving around so I think we’re going to wait and see what the medical people say. I haven’t talked to him.”
Rose is enjoying his highest-scoring season since his most recent All-Star appearance with Chicago in 2011-12, averaging 18.3 points on 48.9 percent shooting. The Pistons (20-42) were already struggling since dealing Andre Drummond to Cleveland and playing without Blake Griffin (knee surgery) for the rest of the season.
