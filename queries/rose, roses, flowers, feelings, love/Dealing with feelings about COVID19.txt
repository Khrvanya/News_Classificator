Many of us have been on an emotional rollercoaster over the past few weeks, experiencing the slow ascent of stress; tipping over the edge into nerve-wracking anxiety; and bottoming out in a pit of anger and gloom.
Coming off a physically distanced Easter and the end of school holidays, it’s likely that many people are feeling down, fed up or at the end of their tether.

It’s natural to feel these negative emotions in the uncertain world we find ourselves in, but these feelings can be problematic both personally and socially.
High levels of stress and anxiety take a significant toll on our mental health and often co-occur with symptoms of depression.
Chronic anger leads to cardiovascular strain , and it can also cause us to lash out at other people, undermining our access to much needed social support and hurting our chances of a harmonious home life.
It is for these reasons that the Australian Government has announced spending increases to protect mental health.
These spending increases are necessary, but we as individuals can also learn strategies that can help us avoid becoming overwhelmed by our emotions.
There are some effective strategies to manage your emotions in this tumultuous time, based on our study of the science of emotion regulation .
One of the best ways to change our feelings is to change the way we think about a situation.
This family of strategies is called ‘cognitive reappraisal’, and can involve looking for a silver lining — like being able to spend more time with loved ones or taking a new perspective on the current situation — like seeing it as a global challenge that humans are coming together to address.

Reinterpreting or reappraising the cause of our emotions in this way lowers emotional intensity and can help us feel better.
For example, in one study , members of our lab found that when people reappraised, changing the way they thought about the cause of their emotions, they tended to feel happier an hour or two later.
Research shows that reappraisal is associated with less depression when used in uncontrollable situations (when we can only change ourselves, not our environment), but is associated with more depression when used in controllable situations (when we can change the situation).
This makes reappraisal a particularly useful strategy at the current time, when many of our activities are restricted to curb the spread of COVID-19.
