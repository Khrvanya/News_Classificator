Raheem Sterling and Danny Rose: the England colleagues expressed concerns about safety.
The England internationals Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling have indicated their discomfort with a Premier League return to action amid the coronavirus crisis.
As top-flight clubs thrash out plans for a resumption in June, with Monday seeing the latest stage in negotiations, the Tottenham full-back Rose, on loan at Newcastle, offered a withering assessment during an Instagram Live, also questioning the idea that sport would help raise the population’s spirits.
“Government is saying ‘bring football back’ because it is going to boost the nation’s morale. I don’t give a fuck about the nation’s morale, bro, people’s lives are at risk,” he said.
“Football shouldn’t even be spoke about coming back until the numbers [infected or dying] have dropped massively. It’s bollocks.”
Meanwhile, Sterling, in a video on his own YouTube channel, said: “The moment we do go back it just needs to be a moment where it’s not just for footballing reasons, it’s safe for not just us but the whole medical staff, referees.
