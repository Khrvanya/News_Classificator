One of our core missions at Rose-Hulman is to provide a campus culture where each individual’s presence is valued, experience is respected, and everyone belongs.
To do so effectively, we cannot tolerate nor condone issues of injustice, discrimination or racism against any marginalized community. Specifically, given recent events, we must decry violence against members of the Black community.
These events have served as a stark reminder of the broad divisions that still exist in our country and the healing that needs to occur. We are committing ourselves as a leadership team to work collectively to bridge this divide by seeking additional ways to build a more just, equitable and inclusive community.
We’ve faced significant challenges in recent months, weeks and days. There are likely many more ahead. However, we’re poised to face them together, alongside our Rose-Hulman Community, and do what we have always done – find new ways to make the world a better place - in an environment of individual attention and support.
