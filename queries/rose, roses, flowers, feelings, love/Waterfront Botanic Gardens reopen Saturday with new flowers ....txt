LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Louisville’s Waterfront Botanical Gardens have been closed to the public since March due to COVID-19.
But Saturday you'll be able to see all of the beautiful flowers that have been growing during that time.
Since the closure, workers have been planting lots of flowers and working on some construction projects.
A new fountain is getting ready to open.
The Beargrass Creek Pathway that connects the gardens to Beargrass Creek and the Butchertown Greenway will be open in a few weeks.
The Waterfront Botanical Gardens opened in October 2019 after years of planning and preparing.
There is still a lot more work to do and elements that will be added but the space looks a lot different than it did a few years ago.
President Kasey Maier says the coolest thing for people to realize is how far the garden has come.
“We’re building a botanical garden on a landfill, so once you see what’s happened in these last three months and all the growth and development, you’re going to start to see what a botanical garden is and what it can mean for you,” Maier said.
Right now it will take you just about 20 minutes to walk through everything on site.
All of the flowers will be labeled with their names, so you can get an idea of what you might want to plant in your own garden.
The garden is only open Saturday and Sunday through July from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m.
If you want to come on a weekday you can call and ask for a tour with a group of 10 or fewer.
