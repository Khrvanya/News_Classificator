Congratulations are in order for former Britain's Got Talent contestant Lettice Rowbotham on the arrival of her baby girl!
The musician took maternity wear to chic new heights when she opted for this understated black dress from Boob Design.
It's a knitted piece which features a turtleneck design and hugs the body perfectly. Don't worry, however, it's super stretchy so will grow with your bump!
Unfortunately, the exact  design has sold out, but click (right) for a similar design at Alex and Alexa.
If you're after a similarly chic, maternity-ready LBD, then head to our edit below for our favourite takes on the trend.
We love the bargain buy from H&M, but that ruched Isabella Oliver design is particularly glamorous.
