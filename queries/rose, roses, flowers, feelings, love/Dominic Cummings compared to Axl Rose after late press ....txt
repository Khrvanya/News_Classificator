Boris Johnson’s chief advisor Dominic Cummings has garnered comparisons to the notoriously tardy Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose, after appearing half an hour late for a press conference today (May 25).
Rose’s name was trending on Twitter while the public waited for Cummings to explain his widely condemned trip from London to Durham in April, which many are saying was in direct contravention of coronavirus lockdown restrictions that he himself helped to create.
During the lengthy delay for Cummings appearance, many compared the wait to the experience of watching Guns N’ Roses live.
He’s the Axl Rose of Downing Street. He’s gonna get to the stage an hour late. Stumble through a few hits. Blame the crowd and then fuck off.
