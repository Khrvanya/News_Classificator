This week, the Modern Love podcast revisits “ Race Wasn’t an Issue to Him, Which Was an Issue To Me ,” an essay by Kim McLarin published in 2006 that asks the question: Is it possible to ignore race in an interracial relationship? In 2020, Ms. McLarin’s answer still holds resonance: No, it is neither possible nor productive.
Lorraine Toussaint, known for her role as Yvonne “Vee” Parker on “ Orange is the New Black ,” reads Ms. McLarin’s essay. Ms. Toussaint stars in the upcoming film, “ The Glorias .”
Ms. McLarin , a memoirist and critically acclaimed novelist, is a former staff writer for The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Associated Press. Ms. McLarin has also taught at Northeastern University, Fairfield University and Emerson College. Her latest book is “ Womanish: A Grown Black Woman Speaks on Love and Life .”
Stay tuned after the reading to hear an updated postscript from Ms. McLarin, as well as the original postscript from Ms. Toussaint.
