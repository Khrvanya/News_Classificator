Mexican designer Moisés Hernández has created three metal stands for displaying flowers without a bulky vase.
No Vase is a collection of three thin plates designed to hold up a single plant stem in lieu of a vase or similar container. The "unconventional" presentation places the focus solely on the upright flower as it sticks out from the small stand.
"The nothingness of the vase creates a subtle cantilever effect where the flower is the main visible element that seems to float in the space," Moisés Hernández said. "This unconventional way to present a flower is inspired by nature, where the flower emerges naturally from the soil."
The designer has fabricated the pieces using different metals cut into shapes, which include a stainless circle, brass hexagon and copper rectangle. The hole in the copper one is placed at one end of the stand rather than in the middle. Under light the silhouettes of the flowers cast as shadows across surfaces.
Each of the three stands comprises two metal parts that fit together. The bottom component is hollowed out in its centre so it can be filled with water for the plant, while the lid is punctured with a small hole through which the flower stem is inserted.
Moisés Hernández said that he considered the "chaotic" nature of Mexico City when designing the inconspicuous objects that serve their purpose as display mechanisms and water vessels.
"In Mexico City, we live in a chaotic and saturated order, where it is usual to be surrounded by many elements, colours and textures," he added. "Hence, what if we create a different perception, where an object seems non-existent but fulfils its function."
Moisés Hernández founded his eponymous studio in Mexico City in 2014. He previously designed a collection of glass cylinders also for presenting a single flower.
