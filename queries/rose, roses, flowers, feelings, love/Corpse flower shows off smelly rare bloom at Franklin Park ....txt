The flower also bloomed in 2012 but isn’t expected to bloom again anytime soon. These flowers usually only bloom once every four to 10 years, according to Britannica .
But you’ll have to be quick to catch the sights and smells. Once it blooms, it only lasts between 24 and 48 hours, the zoo said in a news release .
But the flower is a sight to see.
Blooms can be as big as 9 feet high and 6 feet wide, according to Boston.com , sometimes growing 4 to 5 inches each day.
It’s described as “a very pungent aroma like that of a rotting carcass,” Boston.com reported.
As of Monday, the flower was still in bloom but “may be nearing the end of this very rare bloom,” the zoo posted on Instagram.
Those interested can purchase tickets in advance.
