Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen has agreed to extend his contract until the end of the season, while Danny Rose will remain on loan with Newcastle.
Clubs had until Tuesday to agree extensions with players whose deals expired on June 30.
Belgium international Vertonghen, 33, is still expected to end his seven-year spell at Spurs this summer having reportedly held talks with a number of European clubs already.
Tottenham have also extended the deal of goalkeeper Michael Vorm until the end of the elongated campaign, and agreed for a number of their players to remain at their loan clubs.
As well as Rose, who has made seven appearances for Newcastle in all competitions since moving to St James' Park in January, fellow full-back Kyle Walker-Peters has extended his loan deal at Southampton.
Jack Clarke and Luke Amos will remain at Championship side QPR, Brandon Austin at Danish club Viborg and Armando Shashou with Spanish team Atletico Baleares.
