In this pandemic, you might be feeling fine one day, and then anxious the next. It might be because you're grieving the life you had before many people were forced into isolation.
We're in a global pandemic, and a lot of us are feeling scared right now.
But we're also feeling sad, anxious, angry, lonely — and many other emotions, too.
Experts believe it's because we're experiencing grief and all the feelings that come with that. We’re grieving the lives we had before the COVID-19 pandemic forced many of us into isolation.
MPR News host Angela Davis dives into what this particular type of grief looks like, and how we can lessen it during a difficult time.
David Kessler is a Los Angeles-based grief expert who has written six books on the topic, including “Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief,” his most recent.
Joel Jueckstock is manager of spiritual care and pastoral education for Allina Health’s north region. He has been a chaplain for a decade and wrote his Ph.D. thesis on grief. He works at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids.
