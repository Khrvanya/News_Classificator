rising about 13 points, or 0.9%, to 1,538, above its 50-day moving average of 1,527.18. If gains hold, it would be the first time the index closed above the 50-day trend since August 1. While the large-cap S&P 500 index SPX,
sits about 2% from its record high close of 3,025.86 set on July 26, the Russell 2000 remains 11.7% below its record close of 1,740.75, set on Aug. 31, 2018. The struggles of small-cap stocks have been pointed to by stock-market bears as evidence that U.S. corporations are broadly struggling, even as large-cap companies that dominate the S&P 500 have seen their valuations rise.
