Critical information for the U.S. trading day
The Russell 2000 has been injected with biotechs.
For a second, let’s look beyond whether the leader of the free world spun a tale of quite literally Chinese whispers.
One reason the S&P 500 SPX,
has had such stellar growth since 2006—better, it should be said, than pretty much every developed world index—is the hidden bet made on the big internet and tech plays, which is responsible for about half the outperformance of other large-cap indexes.
, the closely followed small-cap index, is in effect making a similar bet on biotech, according to analysis from strategists Tavis McCourt and Leslie Vandegrift at  Raymond James in the call of the day.
Pharmaceuticals and biotech currently represent 9.4% of the Russell 2000, and 15.5% of the Russell 2000 Growth index RUO,
weightings, the brokerage found. “In this light, given the large exposure that the Russell 2000 and Russell 2000 Growth now have to biotech, it is very likely that the next 10-20 year performance of these indexes vs. other indexes in the U.S. and outside the U.S. will be significantly driven by the performance of small-cap biotech,” the broker said.
That can make for a bit of a roller coaster—a biotech index put together by Raymond James has over twice the volatility of the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500. Some of the weak performers fall out of the index when rebalancing occurs, while the better performers grow out of the index into the S&P 500. Still, while the big boys of the health-care sector have been pouring money into stock buybacks, they still have plenty of cash available for buying out these small-cap minnows.
One way to take advantage of this shift into biotechs is to buy the ones expected to be added to the Russell 2000—the average annual return of buying new entrants in the six months before inclusion is 53%, the strategists say.
