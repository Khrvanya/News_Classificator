, rose during the selloff and fell during the rally.
This is a sad reminder of investors’ tendency to sell during the worst of times and reluctance to buy during the best of times.
On March 26, near the height of fear, I said in the Profit Radar Report: “We anticipate a recovery toward 3,000 [points] for the S&P 500 over the next couple months and quite possibly new all-time highs in 2020.”
Unfortunately, most investors did not get to participate in this fast-and-furious rally. This may have started to change as there’s been a small volume spike in the past few days. Some investors may want to get back in on the action.
The question is: Is it too late to buy now?
At this point, I would not chase the remaining potential upside. That’s why I recommended April 29 to equip the stocks bought in March with stop-loss protection. Here is why:
1. The S&P 500 nearly reached my upside target of 3,000.
2. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust is “wedging” higher (chart above, see price action inside the purple lines). A wedge pattern is indicative of falling prices more often than not.
It is quite common for price to move back toward the beginning of the pattern (dashed purple line), which is as low as 245 for SPY and 2,450 for the S&P 500. However, it will take sustained trade below the upper green support line to activate the downside target. Until that happens, price can continue to move higher.
3. The advance from the March low can be counted as five waves. According to Elliott Wave theory, a complete five-wave rally should be followed by: 1. a sizable decline; 2. an eventual resumption of the rally to new recovery highs. The yellow arrow provides a rough idealized price projection.
