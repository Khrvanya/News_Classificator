Based on the early price action and the current price at $1525.60, the direction of the February Comex gold market on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the Fibonacci level at $1526.40.
Gold futures hit their highest level in more than three months early Tuesday, helping to put the market in a position to post its best yearly performance in nearly a decade. Traders are saying the catalysts behind the rally are a weakening U.S. Dollar and year-end buying tied to position-squaring and thin-volume.
At 05:51 GMT, February Comex gold futures are trading $1525.60, up $6.90 or +0.45%.
The main trend is up according to the daily swing chart. The uptrend was reaffirmed early Tuesday when buyers took out the previous main top at $1525.20.
A trade through $1463.00 will change the main trend to down. This is highly unlikely, but due to the prolonged move up in terms of price and time, short-term traders should start watching for a closing price reversal top. The chart pattern wonâ€™t change the main trend to down, but it could signal the start of a 2 to 3 day correction.
The main range is $1571.70 to $1453.10. Gold is currently testing its 50% to 61.8% retracement zone at $1512.40 to $1526.40. This zone is controlling the near-term direction of the market.
Based on the early price action and the current price at $1525.60, the direction of the February Comex gold market on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the Fibonacci level at $1526.40.
A sustained move over $1526.40 will indicate the presence of buyers. This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the upside. The first targets are main tops at $1532.40 and $1549.90. The major target is the 2019 main top at $1571.70.
A sustained move under $1526.40 will signal the presence of sellers. If this move creates enough downside momentum then look for a test of the main 50% level at $1512.40. This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the downside.
