Stock market caution signals are beginning to show up and active investors should take note.
I am seeing some severe breaks of the bearish wedge patterns I highlighted recently.
I would be out of (ie. sell, hedge, or short) all but the Nasdaq Composite which needs a bit more of a break lower to confirm its pullback.
Below are 5 “daily” charts, highlighting short-term trading outlooks.
The are the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite, Russell 2000 Index, Mid-Caps, and Dow Jones Transportation Average.
