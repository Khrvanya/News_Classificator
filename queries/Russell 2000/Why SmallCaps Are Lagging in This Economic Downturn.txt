Prior to Covid-19, lower rates from the Fed should have created an optimal opportunity for the Russell 2000 to outpace large-cap indices.
Since early 2019, the Russell 2000, the primary index for small-cap stocks, has lagged mid- and large-cap benchmarks.
Many investors consider the Russell 2000 the most comprehensive indicator of the U.S. economy due to its breadth of industries as well as most companies’ central exposure to the United States. In general, small-cap companies tend to appreciate more than large-caps during periods of economic growth because of their lower valuations and higher level of debt. Companies with under a $2 billion market cap meet the criteria to be considered small-caps.
Over the past year, the Fed has lowered rates to help artificially stimulate the economy. Prior to the Covid-19 economic conditions, these actions should have created an optimal opportunity for the Russell 2000 to outpace large-cap indices, but that has not been the case due to the environment’s artificial nature. It is understandable why small-cap stocks were hit even harder by the Covid-19 outbreak, but why have their growth cycles lagged that of mid-cap and large-cap stocks significantly?
Christmas Eve in 2018 marked the bottom of a tumultuous year for stocks. Since this Christmas Eve bottom, the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial averages increased 38.10%, 18.25% and 4.51% respectively, while the Russell 2000 decreased by almost 3%. Even before the Covid-19 selloff, small-caps were underperforming large-caps as the 10-year economic growth cycle was beginning to slow down following a record 10-year bull market.
Although the Covid-19 outbreak is a black swan event and could not have been predicted, the Russell 2000 flashed warning signs of an economic pullback throughout 2019 as it failed to retest all-time highs even though the S&P 500 and other large-cap indices kept setting new records. As of the end of April, the Russell 2000 is still about 21% off all-time highs set in August 2018 but has also retraced over 50% of the selloff from its low on March 18.
Another reason the Russell 2000 has underperformed relative to S&P 500 is the composition by sector of the indices. The best-performing sector in 2019 was technology, led heavily by Facebook ( FB ) - Get Report , Amazon ( AMZN ) - Get Report , Apple ( AAPL ) - Get Report , Netflix ( NFLX ) - Get Report , & Google ( GOOGL ) - Get Report (FAANG). According to Siblis Research, as of December 31, 2019 the S&P 500 was comprised of 10% FAANG and in turn technology accounted for 23% of its total value, allowing the technology sector to pull the S&P 500 with it.
