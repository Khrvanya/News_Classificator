Punjab fails to give 40% share, gets no benefit of agriculture scheme

CHANDIGARH: Benefits of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) have eluded agrarian state of Punjab because of the failure to contribute 40% of its funding share for the scheme, according to a parliamentary standing committee on agriculture .
The Punjab government could hardly utilise Rs 62.65 crore out of the total Rs 176.01crore released by the Central government in 2017-18 and 2018-19 despite all its talk on diversification of agriculture.
Under the centrally-sponsored scheme, the Union government contributes 60% funding. The remaining has to be shared by state governments except north-eastern and hilly states, where the funding pattern is 90:10.
The 32-member committee headed by P C Gaddigoudar, MP, Bagalkot, Karnataka, tabled its report in both houses of Parliament on March 3. When the parliamentary committee asked the agriculture ministry about reasons for reduction in allocation under the scheme during 2017-18, the ministry officials replied, “This is one of the schemes which is quite popular in the states. But in a few states, because of states’ share issues, there is a gap. Punjab is one state which has not taken even the first installment.” The ministry officials said besides a few other states, Punjab has not been able to spend the money already released to it under the scheme.
The report mentioned that out of the total allocated amount of Rs 284.47 crore in the financial year of 2017-18, the Union government had released Rs 131.42 crore to the Punjab government. But the state government was able to send a utilisation certificate for Rs 62.65 crore to the centre.
Therefore, in the next financial year (2018-19), the Union government only released Rs 44.59 crore to the Punjab government out of the total allocation of Rs 90.60 crore. Since the state government failed to contribute its 40% share for the scheme, it failed to send a utilisation certificate.
As a result, the Union government did not release even a single penny to the Punjab government in 2019-20 under the scheme though Rs 90.95 crore was allocated for the state.
The Union government had revamped the scheme in November 2017 as ‘Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana — Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation’ with major focus on pre and post-harvest infrastructure besides promoting agri-entrepreneurship, innovations and value addition.
The scheme is available for the entire spectrum of agriculture and allied sector activities such as crop development, horticulture, agricultural mechanisation, marketing, animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries.
