Farm sector braves pandemic shock, 4 stocks worth looking at
With most sectors in a slump, the monsoon will also have an impact on employment generation, auto sales, and demand of cement and steel.
India's agriculture sector stands out as a ray of hope as it has been relatively less affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
India is the largest exporter of rice globally and second-largest producer of wheat and rice after China. But the country's legal framework, so far, discouraged private sector investment in warehousing. It put stock limits on any trader, processor or exporter. When farmers brought their produce to the market after the harvest, there was a glut and due to lack of storage facilities they did not get desired price.
All this will now be streamlined as government has encouraged private investments in storage facility and allowed farmers to sell to anyone outside the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) yard.
