“India has remained consistently a net exporter of agri-products, touching Rs 2.7 lakh crore exports and imports at Rs 1.37 lakh crore in 2018-19,” the survey said.
NEW DELHI: There is a need to give increased focus on exploring global markets for agricultural commodities to give an additional source of market for the surplus of agricultural produce India currently has, said The Economic Survey 2019-20. The survey said that India has been a net exporter of agri products since the economic reforms began in 1991.
“India has remained consistently a net exporter of agri-products, touching Rs 2.7 lakh crore exports and imports at Rs 1.37 lakh crore in 2018-19,” the survey said.
India occupies a leading position in global trade of agricultural products. However, its total agricultural export basket accounts for a little over 2.15 per cent of the world agricultural trade. The major export destinations are USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nepal and Bangladesh.
Among agricultural commodities, basmati rice, spices, oil meals, sugar cotton and castor oil have been leading export commodities.
The government has taken several steps to boost agricultural exports. Under Foreign Trade Policy 2015- 20, rates of reward under merchandise exports from India (MEIS) were enhanced on export of various agriculture items on 1st November, 2017 to offset high transit cost. The government has recently initiated a comprehensive “Agriculture Export Policy” aimed at doubling the agricultural exports and integrating Indian farmers and agricultural products with the global value chains. It has created agri cells in many Indian embassies abroad to take care of agricultural trade related issues.
