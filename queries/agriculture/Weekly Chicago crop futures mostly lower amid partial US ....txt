Weekly Chicago crop futures mostly lower amid partial U.S. reopening of economy
CHICAGO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures were mostly lower for the trading week ending May 15 as parts of the United States struggled to return to economic activity after a weeks-long COVID-19 shutdown.
Corn futures remained unchanged as ethanol inventories dipped slightly when more motorists took to the road after some stay-at-home orders were relaxed. With a modest positive margin in sight, several ethanol plants moved to return to production. But the move is expected to pressure margins with gasoline consumption forecast to plateau at 77 percent to 82 percent of year-ago levels as many Americans remain fearful of COVID-19 through summer.
Global weather patterns remain broadly favorable for corn. A coming mix of rain, sun and warming temperatures across the central U.S. region is expected to boost growth with pollination occurring during late June and the first half of July. Amid the slow battle back to normal economic activity, exporters worldwide are expected to compete aggressively for any demand.
U.S. wheat futures ended sharply lower, hurt by cheap new crop offers out of the European Union and Europe's Black Sea region. Importer demand for new crop U.S. wheat has been limited and will stay as such into mid-summer.
Soybean futures also were lower as the May World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASADE) report from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proved to be one of the most uneventful in years. Lower old crop exports were expected amid the slow pace of shipments.
U.S. 2019/20 soybean stocks gained 100 million bushels while 2020/21 stocks are forecast to fall by 175 million bushels. Despite declining stocks, USDA forecasts a lower season average price in the year ahead due to cheap corn. Enditem
