The global pH meter Market was worth USD 1.32 billion in 2014 and is expected to reach approximately USD 2.15 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 5.60%. The pH meter is a device that measures acidity or alkalinity of water based solutions with the help of potential difference between its electrodes. The pH meter industry is driven by rising demand of these devices in various industries like agriculture, food processing, water treatment, mining, pharmaceuticals, etc. Besides this, rising health concerns, gastrointestinal diseases, and increase in awareness of test and treatment of various gastro related diseases and technological advancements in pH meters would boost the market.
The presence of bacterial infection in blood samples is a primary cause of transfusion-related mortality and morbidity. Hence, blood transfusion facilities need to employ systems to detect the bacteria in Platelet (PLT) apparatuses. The pH of whole blood PLTs (WBPs) is calculated with the help of a pH meter as a surrogate test for bacterial infection and to prevent the transfusion of bacterially contaminated RBCs and WBPs. Thus, the demand for pH meters is increasing rapidly in the field of hospitals, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical laboratories, ultimately boosting growth of the pH meter market.
