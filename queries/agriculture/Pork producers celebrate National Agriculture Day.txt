U.S. hog farmers are committed to keeping American kitchens stocked with affordable, nutritious protein.
National Pork Producers Council | Mar 24, 2020
The National Pork Producers Council stands with U.S. agriculture today as we celebrate National Agriculture Day and honor those workers who are essential to the nation's food supply.
In a declaration signed on Monday, President Trump said "since our nation's earliest days, farming communities have been a bedrock of our society ... As our nation continues to face the unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, we pay tribute to the unbeatable strength of America's agricultural producers as they once again answer the call to feed our country and the world."
"Today's celebration to honor our farmers, producers and ranchers couldn't come at a more important time for our industry," says NPPC president Howard "A.V." Roth, a pork producer from Wauzeka, Wis. "As we grapple with the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts on our daily lives, consumers can rest assured that U.S. agriculture will always be there to feed the nation and the globe. The U.S. hog farmers represented by NPPC are committed to keeping American kitchens stocked with affordable, nutritious protein."
