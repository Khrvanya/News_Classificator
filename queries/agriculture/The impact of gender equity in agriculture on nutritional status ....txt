Undernutrition among women and children remains a major public health problem in most low-income and middle-income countries, and is most prevalent in rural areas.1 Yet, estimates indicate that implementation of 10 nutrition interventions at 90% coverage would only reduce child stunting by 20%,2 half of the World Health Assembly target of a 40% reduction by 2025. New approaches are needed from other nutrition-relevant sectors such as agriculture.2
A well-functioning agriculture sector can improve nutrition outcomes through several pathways.3 For instance, farmers can increase the quantity and nutrient density of produce for consumption, generate more agricultural income to purchase nutritious foods,4 5 or increase availability and affordability of nutritious foods in markets.3 Many agricultural interventions developed to improve nutrition outcomes, such as promotion of biofortified foods, homestead food production and livestock keeping, have improved household and child dietary intakes.5 However, gender-based inequities within agriculture may limit the sector’s potential to provide nutritious diets and improve nutrition outcomes.5 In many lowincome rural settings, women have lower ownership and use of land, livestock and other productive assets,5 lower economic participation and wage rates,6 and heavier workloads,7 compared with men.
Although it is plausible that closing the gender gap in agriculture could improve nutritional outcomes, this hypothesis remains conceptually underdeveloped and reliant on few, commonly cited studies8–10 or reviews11 12 of women’s empowerment, rather than relative measures of gender inequity. Several pathways may exist between gender inequities in agriculture and nutrition outcomes (online supplementary figure 1). One pathway may exist via women’s increased control over household spending decisions, leading to higher investment in women’s and children’s nutrition.11 Another pathway may be through improvements in household food availability.13 Studies indicate that agricultural production is more efficient in equitable households, leading to higher yields overall.14 At the societal level, gender equity could reduce poverty and improve nutritional outcomes15 through increases in economic equality between households.
Identifying the potential for equity-focused interventions to effectively complement existing nutrition and agricultural interventions requires better understanding of the effects of gender inequities in agriculture on nutritional outcomes. We systematically reviewed quantitative and qualitative evidence on the associations between gender inequities and women’s and children’s nutritional status, their diets, and household food security in agricultural settings of low-income and middle-income countries.
