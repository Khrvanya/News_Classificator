The Medical Officer of Health for Huron and Perth says the one positive case of COVID-19 among migrant workers in Huron County has been resolved.
But Doctor Miriam Klassen says the risk for migrant workers throughout the Province continues to be an issue. The issues are similar to those that could be found in long term care homes.
“For infection prevention control long term homes were hit hard and I think we’re learning that in some ways the approach to temporary foreign workers, particularly with the closed housing conditions and perhaps barriers to accessing health care, can also lead to outbreaks,” said Klassen. “So the Chief Medical Officer of Health has shared that Medical Officers of Health should consider class section orders with regards to farms, just to ensure that all farms are aware of the guidance documents and the recommendations to protect their farms from outbreaks.”
In the Windsor-Essex region, 180 new cases of COVID-19 over the weekend were linked to a single farm.
