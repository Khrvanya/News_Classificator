NEW Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen was previously banned from driving for three months after being caught drink-driving, it has been reported.
The paper reports that the incident happened on the night of September 18, 2016.
They say Minister Cowen was stopped at a Garda checkpoint four years ago, midway between Dublin and his home in Co Offaly.
The Fianna Fáil TD was returning home hours after the All-Ireland football final between Dublin and Mayo.
He had two drinks before the game and something to eat after the match, the Irish Independent reports.
The paper adds that the Minister was breath-tested on the spot, where alcohol was detected.
He was then tested again at a Garda station and was found to be over the limit.
Minister Cowen was punished with a fixed charge penalty notice and a €200 fine. He was also disqualified from driving for three months.
The case never went to court because the level of alcohol in his body did not reach the amount necessary for a prosecution.
He said: "I am profoundly sorry for having made that mistake. I am deeply apologetic to all those close to me and to my colleagues, for this appalling lapse of judgement."
The new Minister for Agriculture was appointed just last week, taking over the role from Michael Creed.
He is also the brother of former Taoiseach Brian Cowen.
The news of the new Minister's driving disqualification arrives after controversy regarding new Taoiseach Micheal Martin’s ministerial selections.
The new Government is made up of six Dubliners, three Cork TDs, two Wicklow deputies, one Kerry TD, one Meath TD, one Monaghan minister and one Offaly TD.
