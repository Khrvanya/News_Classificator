Budget 2020: Govt expands PM KUSUM scheme for solar pumps, targets to cover 20 lakh farmers
FM said that 15 lakh farmers would be provided funds to set up grid-connected 15 lakh solar pumps.
NEW DELHI: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced expansion of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Utthan Mahabhiyan ( PM KUSUM ) Scheme under which 20 lakh farmers would be provided funds to set up standalone solar pumps.
While presenting the budget for 2020-21, the minister said that 15 lakh farmers would be provided funds to set up grid-connected 15 lakh solar pumps.
The previous Modi government in February last year had unveiled the PM KUSUM scheme with an outlay of Rs 34,422 crore.
Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha that the scheme has removed farmers' dependence on diesel and kerosene and linked them to solar energy. The scheme also enables the farmers to set up solar power generation capacity and sell it to the grid.
All three components combined, the scheme had aimed to add a solar capacity of 25,750 MW by 2022.
