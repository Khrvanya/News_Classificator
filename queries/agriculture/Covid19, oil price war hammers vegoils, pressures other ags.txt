A crude oil price war triggered over the weekend has hammered vegoils and pressured other agricultural commodities globally.
On Friday Russia’s government signalled it would not cut crude production in a bid to prop up prices, in turn sparking a price war with Saudi Arabia, which slashed its official selling price for grades of crude.
That had an immediate impact on key crude benchmarks – Brent and WTI – which fell between 20% and 30% immediately on Sunday.
Below is a round-up of the impact on agricultural futures.
Palm oil futures are poised to suffer their biggest one day fall in two months, with almost 7% wiped off the price of crude palm oil on the Bursa Malaysia.
The front-month contract was trading at MYR2,291/mt ($543/mt) by time of press after recovering from hitting a low of MYR2,200/mt ($521/mt) – the lowest level since mid-October.
“CPO futures were slaughtered this morning after facing an incredibly powerless market roiled by oil price crash and Covid-19. These twin impacts brought CPO futures to its knees erasing 10%, or wiping off 245 points, to hit limit down MYR2,206/mt,” said one broker.
In China, the majority of agricultural futures ranging from the soybean complex to sugar, all plunged into the red on Monday.
“Domestic [markets] were plunging on all fronts today. The sentiment is very bad… Crude oil fell so much and vegetable oils all reached trade-stops. It is terrifying,” said one China-based hedge fund manager.
European rapeseed prices fell over 1% in morning trade following the wider selloff to hit their lowest level since late October last year.
Dutch rapeseed oil prices were expected to open €16/mt lower on Monday morning from Friday’s close, with April loading valued around €764/mt FOB DM – its lowest since August 2019 and down nearly €200/mt since the start of the year.
Soyoil futures took a hammering overnight, following crude oil, palm oil and equities lower to hit a 20-month low.
The most liquid contract was valued at 27.53 c/lb ($607/mt) by time of press.
Yet while oils felt the biggest hit, grains and oilseed volatility was more muted.
Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade were down 1.7% at $8.76/bu ($322/mt) to hit a near six-week low, while soymeal was down just 1% at $301/st, down to a 10-day low.
