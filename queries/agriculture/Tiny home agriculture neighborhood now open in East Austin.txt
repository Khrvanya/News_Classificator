Instead of a pool or golf course, the Village Farm Tiny House Community will feature Green Gate Farms as its main amenity.

AUSTIN, Texas — In an agriculture neighborhood, residents can help work on a farm and buy local, organic produce for a reduced price, then walk a few steps to go home.
It's not a new idea to feature a farm as the centerpiece of a new neighborhood development, but the people behind Village Farm Tiny Home Community believe it's the first "agrihood" in Central Texas and the first tiny home agrihood in the country.
"It's not the kind of place where you go home, put the garage door down and don't talk to anyone," Rebecca Powers, the customer care manager of Village Farm, said. "It's truly a place where you know everyone on a first-name basis and that makes it really special and unique."
Powers also lives in one of the tiny homes on site.
Roberts Communities built tiny homes in the neighborhood east of Downtown Austin in 2018. On Saturday, Roberts and Green Gate Farms held the first soft opening for the tiny homes nearest the farm.
"The farm and the city have been so far apart, and this kind of brings the farmer closer to the center of the community," Skip Connett, the vegetable farmer at Green Gate Farms, said.
Connett and his wife, Erin Flynn – who organizes the wildflower Community Supported Agriculture program at Green Gate Farms – will also be living in one of the tiny homes.
"This idea behind having a small footprint around a small farm that's certified organic, I mean, that really hits a lot of the buttons that are really important for people today," Connett said.
"It gives more access to food that everybody else hasn't touched," Stephanie Evans, a new homeowner in the agrihood, said.
Evans has watched Village Farm grow since the first two tiny homes were built in 2018. She even did a trial run in a tiny home by house-sitting for a friend.
