MADISON, Wis. (WKBT) – A new report is detailing how the legislature can help the Wisconsin’s economy during the pandemic.
‘Wisconsin Tomorrow’ was a project of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation.
Not surprisingly, the state’s agriculture industry is feeling a financial pinch.
Across the state, more than $600 million will be lost by the state’s farmers.
To rebound, state leaders say there are things that can be done.
“Re-skill and up-skill workers to get them back to work. Point number two, provide accessible affordable and quality broadband throughout Wisconsin. And point number three, support innovation to help businesses pivot, plan, adapt or change operations,” said Randy Romanski, Secretary-designee Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.
