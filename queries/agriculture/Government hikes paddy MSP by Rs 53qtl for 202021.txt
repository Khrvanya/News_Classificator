The decision, taken by the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , will give respite to farmers and also help them take a call on which kharif (summer) crop to grow as sowing picks up with the arrival of southwest monsoon.
Paddy is the main kharif crop, the sowing of which has already begun and covered in 35 lakh hectare so far. The Met Department has projected normal monsoon for the June-September period.
"Based on the recommendation of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the Cabinet has approved MSP of 14 kharif crops for 2020-21. Farmers would get 50-83 per cent higher return over the cost of production," Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told the media after the meeting.
The Centre has increased the MSP of kharif crops for 2020-21 crop year in line with the principle of fixing MSPs at a level which is at 1.5 times the cost of production that was announced in 2018-19, he said.
The government has raised paddy MSP for both common and A grade varieties by Rs 53 per quintal for the 2020-21 over the last year.
Accordingly, the MSP of paddy (common grade) has been fixed at Rs 1,868 per quintal, while that of A grade variety has been raised to Rs 1,888 for this year.
The paddy MSP fixed is 50 per cent higher than the cost of production at Rs 1,245 per quintal (common) and Rs 1,746 per quintal (A grade), the minister added.

According to the government, the expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of Bajra (83 per cent) followed by urad (64 per cent), tur (58 per cent) and maize (53 per cent). For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50 per cent.
Concerted efforts were made over the last few years to realign the MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers to shift to larger areas under these crops and adopt best technologies and farm practices, to correct demand - supply imbalance, it said.
The added focus on nutri-rich nutri-cereals is to incentivise its production in the areas where rice and wheat cannot be grown without long term adverse implications for groundwater table, it added.
