What happens to MF investment when an investor dies without nominating anyone? AMFI guideline
The KCC provides short term loans to farmers at an interest rate of 4 per cent on the condition of timely payment.
According to government-run State Bank of India , interest will be waived up to 3 per cent if the farmer repays the loan promptly. In case of late payment, the bank will charge an interest rate of 7 per cent on the loan amount.
The limit of the card can be increased for a loan up to Rs 3 lakh if KCC holder re-pays his/her due amount on time.
What makes the scheme significant is that no collateral is needed for a loan up to an amount of Rs 1.60 lakh. Collateral security has been waived for the limit of up to Rs 1.6 lakh, according to the information available on the SBI website.
The banks will only charge simple interest on the loans. However, in the case of untimely payment or bank default, compound interest will be charged by the banks.
The amount of loan for the first time will be ascertained by bank officials after factoring in the cost of cultivation and post-harvest expenses. On timely payments of the loans, the limit of the loans can be extended up to an amount of 3 lakh.
Apart from cheap credit, the crop of all farmers who have taken credit via KCC card will also be insured by the crop insurance scheme.
The KCC account will also provide high interest to farmers on their savings in the account. Saving interest rate will be applied on their credit balance.
