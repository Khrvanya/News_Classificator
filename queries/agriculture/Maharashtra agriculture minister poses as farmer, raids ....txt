AURANGABAD: In an undercover operation, Maharashtra agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse on Sunday posed as a farmer and raided a fertilizer shop in the Jadhavmandi area here. Bhuse said the surprise raid was prompted by an increasing number of complaints against traders allegedly stocking up fertilizers illegally to sell them at exorbitant rates.
“There were an increasing numbers of farmers’ complaints against traders. So I personally turned up at this shop claiming to be a farmer. The trader, despite having fertilizers stocked in the shop, said he did not have any,” said Bhuse.
The minister said the agriculture department’s quality control officer has been sent on forced leave.
On learning about the raid by the minister, agriculture department officials rushed to the shop, Navbharat Fertilizers, and carried out a spot panchanama. The process of assessing the stock was still underway till late in the evening.
When contacted, district agriculture superintendent Tukaram Mote said, “We are screening the stock at the shop owned by Navin Patni. Depending on the findings, appropriate action will be initiated against the trader.”
Senior officials from the administration said this was the first time that a sitting minister has walked the extra mile to carry out a raid on a shop selling fertilizers at inflated prices.
Farmer activist Deepak Joshi said, “Exploitation of farmers by the seed and fertilizer traders is nothing new. During the sowing season each year, farmers are forced to purchase seeds as well as fertilizers at inflated rates while the authorities remain mute spectators.”
Agriculture department officials said they were also open to acting against such shops but there were no concrete complaints to act upon.
