Midlands Asset Finance has appointed Sue Baker to support SME clients in the agriculture and construction sectors with debt refinancing and the purchase of new assets.
She previously worked in the food, agriculture and construction divisions at DLL and spent 12 years as a business development manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland, working across all asset finance sectors.
Baker (pictured) said: “Having spent most of the last decade in the agricultural and construction sectors, I’m looking forward to using my experience to work with both new and existing clients to offer funding solutions for their businesses.”
Midlands Asset Finance supports the SME and mid-corporate markets to source funding across a range of products.
Services include Asset Finance Compared, its online division that offers an online Decision-in-Principle in 60 seconds, with all documentation through to pay-out being handled in-house.
Rachel Borlace, director of agriculture and renewables, said: “Sue has a fantastic knowledge of the sector and is widely recognised around the industry, so it’s a huge coup for MAF. Her vast experience in agriculture and working closely with dealers, farmers and manufacturers will continue to strengthen our team.”
