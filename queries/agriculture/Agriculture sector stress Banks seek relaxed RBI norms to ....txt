The IBA has suggested that instead of declaring those accounts which have not received full repayment as non-performing assets (NPA), farmers should be given a wider window for repayments.
The suggested change would result in a combined facility of cash credit and term loan.
Lenders have written to the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) seeking relaxation in asset quality classification norms of agriculture sector advances and sought restructuring of farm loan accounts, people aware of the developments said.
In a recent representation to the RBI, the Indian Banking Association (IBA) has suggested that only 40% of agri loans repayments be linked to the crop, while the remaining 60% be paid over a period of three to five years.
The suggested measure will help banks get a handle on their significantly-stressed agriculture loan books.
The IBA has suggested that instead of declaring those accounts which have not received full repayment as non-performing assets (NPA), farmers should be given a wider window for repayments. “What has been suggested to the central bank is that when a crop loan is given, 60% should be an amount which can be repaid over a period of 3-5 years, only 40% should be paid based on the crop. So, the stress in the agriculture book does not go up,” one source said.
