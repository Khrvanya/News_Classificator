Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the corn market has the most support.
“The surprise was the drop in the condition ratings for corn, but the market was only able to challenge recent highs and then backed off. Pretty disappointing for the bulls. Wheat down hard on the harvest and a lack of biz. Beans down a bit too I think mostly on the weaker Real. Overall, the market pretty underwhelming,” Scoville says.

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors see yesterday's crop ratings as market-friendly.
"The USDA Crop Progress report showed conditions lower than expected," Kluis told customers in a daily note. "The USDA Crop Progress report will show lower conditions again next week as the heat takes a toll on crops across the U.S. The ratings last week may be the highest for the year.
Kluis added, "Watch the stock market. Another higher day of trade will signal an important short-term low. This should also be positive for the meat and grain markets."
