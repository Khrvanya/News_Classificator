The Angolan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will strengthen support for production of essential goods, thus contributing to the reduction of imports and, consequently, making savings in foreign currency, the minister said in Luanda.
Ant√≥nio Francisco de Assis, who spoke at the ceremony in which he was officially took on the role of Fisheries minister, following the merger of the Fisheries Ministry with the Ministry of Agriculture, said that the structure created by the President of the Republic, as part of government reforms, is responsible for creating a political, institutional and normative environment that will allow private operators to carry out their activities.
In the current situation, he pointed out, the funds available should be directed, preferably, to the productive sector.
Assis said that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will follow the policy of reducing the weight of the State in the productive sector, extending the area of intervention of the private sector.
Assis was sworn in as part of a recent government reshuffle, which reduced the Government from 28 to 21 ministries.
The merger of the two ministerial departments recreates the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, which was split in previous terms of office.
The new ministry has three Secretaries of State: one for Agriculture and Livestock, another for Forests and a third for Fisheries. (macauhub)
