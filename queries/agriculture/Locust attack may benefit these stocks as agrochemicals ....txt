With the locust attack gathering headlines the consumption of agrochemical may increase in the near term as farmers get worried about the crops, said ICICI Securities. “We also expect such disruptive events to provide stimulus to usage of agrochemicals in India and expect structurally higher growth rates of agrochemicals in India,” The pest attack, currently is not expected to have an immediate impact on the farmers, as the rabi seasons got over in March. However, if the attacks continue till June, which is when the Kharif season starts, the locust swarms could prove deadly for the Indian agriculture sector.
