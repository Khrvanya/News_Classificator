Ukraine has launched the Accelerating Private Investment in Agriculture program according to the agreement signed last year, according to the website of the Ministry of Finance. “On May 20 this year, after Ukraine had conducted domestic procedures, the loan agreement entered into force,” the ministry said.
The loan amount is $200 million, the Finance Ministry noted.
The program should facilitate the creation of the State Agrarian Register and make it publicly available, conduct an inventory of state property lands and include these statements in the state land cadaster, develop a methodology for drawing up land use plans, conduct satellite mapping of the territory of Ukraine, and create an automated notification system for changes in the state land cadaster.
The agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) was concluded on August 27, 2019.
The IBRD is the main lending institution of the World Bank.
