The main purpose of the Weed Control Act R.S.O. 1990, is to reduce the impact of noxious weeds on the industries of agriculture and horticulture.  Primarily this act applies to agricultural and horticultural lands that generate income or other benefits to agriculture; this excludes lawns, gardens and private areas for personal enjoyment and leisure.
Under the Weed Control Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter W.5 Sections 3, 13, 16 and 23, you are requested to destroy all noxious weeds on your property.
Sections 3, 13, 16 and 18 do not apply to noxious weeds or weed seeds that are far enough away from any land used for agricultural or horticultural purposes, as they do not interfere with that use.
All properties within the Municipality of the Town Penetanguishene are hereby requested to be in compliance with the Weed Control Act by the 17 day of July, 2020 and throughout the season.
