None seems powerful enough to describe the events of the past few months.
Millions of COVID-19 infections, hundreds of thousands of deaths and economic havoc that has left no one untouched.
Amid this, it would seem impossible to find a bright light. But there is one: agriculture.
Food, and how it is produced, has been thrust into the spotlight as people put all their attention on that most basic of needs – feeding themselves and their family.
Never before have we seen such demand placed on our food production system. Yet the farmers – and those along the supply chain – have stood up magnificently.
As rumblings began that Australia could run out of food, farmers countered in the best way possible – by continuing to supply supermarkets, greengrocers and butchers with the best product they could.
Australia is extremely lucky to have its agriculture system. We produce enough food to feed three times our population. Few countries can make such a claim.
And the standard to which local farmers produce food is among the best in the world.
But it is not just on our plates that we see the value of agriculture. Amid plunging share prices, the best performers on the Australian Stock Exchange have been agribusinesses. As Peter Hemphill explains on Page 7, some of the best known agriculture stocks – The a2 Milk Company, Elders and Bega Cheese – have held or lifted their share price since the market began to plunge on February 24.
The Weekly Times recognising the vital role farming plays in helping the world through this crisis, last month began a campaign with a simple message: It Starts With Ag. Never truer words have been said.
