The crops sub-sector accounted for nearly 62% of the agriculture and allied sector in 2011-12, which has gradually come down to about 58% in 2016-17.
NEW DELHI: The share of agriculture, forestry and fishing declined to 17.9% in India ’s gross value added (GVA) in 2016-17 from 18.6% in 2013-14, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) said in a report.
“The share of this sector in overall GVA of the country is showing a declining trend except in the years 2013-14 and 2016-17,” Mo-SPI said in the report on agriculture, forestry and fishing from 2011-12 to 2016-17. India’s economy grew 8.2% in 2016-17.
The crops sub-sector accounted for nearly 62% of the agriculture and allied sector in 2011-12, which has gradually come down to about 58% in 2016-17. Of the 12 sub-sectors of crops, the share of cereals, oilseeds, sugar crops and fibres declined over the five year period. As per the report, India ranks first in the world in arable land (156.46 million hectare), third in production of cereals; second in groundnut, fruits, vegetables, sugarcane , tea; and first in jute.
Worldwide as of 2016, the country had the largest herds of buffalo and ranked second in cattle; third in sheep; second in goat and sixth in chicken population. It is the largest producer of milk; third in production of eggs and sixth in production of meat. Among fruits, output was highest for mangoes, followed by banana .
The report showed that the output of cereals was highest among all the crop-groups in 2011-12. But in 2016-17, the output of fruits and vegetables was the highest.
“A move towards fruits and vegetables suggests greater diversification of diet from a cereal consuming country. High cereal consumption is a mark of poverty. However, the shelf life of fruits and vegetables is short and their wastage is not being estimated. This is key because while storage has improved, transportation and handling can be better,” said former chief statistician Pronab Sen.
Among cereals, jowar and bajra have lost share while paddy, maize and wheat have gained.
Among states, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest output of cereals in all the years, although its share in all-India output has reduced marginally from 18.6% in 2011-12 to 17.9% in 2016-17.
During 2011-12 to 2016-17, the output of ‘fibre’ group of crops reduced from about Rs 82,000 crore in 2011-12 to about Rs 73,000 crore in 2016-17. Kapas accounted for nearly 95% of output of ‘fibre’ crops. During this period, the output of cotton was lowest in 2015-16 at Rs 64,000 crore, which rose marginally in 2016-17 to Rs 68,000 crore.
