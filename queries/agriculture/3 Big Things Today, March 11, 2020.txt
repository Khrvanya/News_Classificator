Soybeans Higher, Grains Lower Overnight; USDA Leaves Domestic Stocks Estimates Unchanged.
Crop futures were mixed in overnight trading Wednesday, with soybeans higher and corn and wheat lower.
Tuesday’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) Report did little to rile the markets, as traders have their eyes more focused on the spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and global geopolitical events.
So far 119,476 people have been infected globally, and the death toll now stands at 4,291, according to Johns Hopkins University. Almost 66,000 people have recovered from the disease, the university said.
Gains in the stock indexes Tuesday have been erased in premarket trading, as futures are pointing toward a lower open.
Oil futures resumed their downward trend overnight with U.S. standard West Texas Intermediate falling 2.5% to $33.46 a barrel and global benchmark Brent futures dropping 2.4% to $36.33 a barrel.
Crude prices have taken a beating in the past couple of days after Saudi Arabia started a price war with Russia after the two countries couldn’t agree on steps to take to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus.
Demand for commodities pretty much across the board has been damaged by the spread of the disease.
Soybean futures for May delivery rose 2½¢ to $8.78¾ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal gained $1.10 to $303 a short ton, and soy oil added 0.10¢ to 27.77¢ a pound.
Corn futures fell 2¢ to $3.75½ a bushel overnight.
Wheat futures for May delivery lost 3¢ to $5.19¼ a bushel, while Kansas City futures declined 1¾¢ to $4.43 a bushel.
2. USDA Leaves Domestic Stockpiles Outlook Unchanged For Corn, Beans, and Wheat
The USDA left its domestic inventories projections unchanged in a quiet World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) Report yesterday, surprising almost nobody.
Its corn ending stocks forecast was unchanged from February at 1.892 billion bushels, in line with analyst estimates compiled by Reuters.
Bean inventories at the end of the marketing year on August 31 were pegged by the USDA at 425 million bushels, also unchanged month to month but just behind the average analyst projection of 426 million.
Wheat stockpiles at the end of the grain’s marketing year on May 31 are seen at 940 million bushels, on par with the previous month but behind the outlook for 944 million bushels.
The USDA’s projection for global ending stocks of corn was raised slightly to 297.3 million metric tons from 296.8 million a month earlier, which is a drastic decline from the 320.8 million tons in storage at the end of the marketing year on August 31.
World soybean stockpiles are now seen at 102.4 million metric tons, up from 98.9 million but well below the previous year’s 111.9 million tons.
Global wheat inventories on May 31 are now pegged by the government at 287.1 million metric tons, down modestly from the previous projection for 288 million and up from 277.6 million tons at the end of the prior marketing year.
Extremely dry weather has led to a red-flag warning in western Nebraska today, according to the National Weather Service.
The warning is in effect from noon to 7 p.m. local time today.
Sustained winds of 10 to 20 mph are expected with gusts of up to 30 mph, the NWS said in a report early this morning. Relative humidity is expected to be as low as 18%.
High temperatures will be warm, in the mid- to upper 60s, the agency said.
Farther south in parts of eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas, scattered thunderstorms are moving across the area with some becoming strong.
Severe thunderstorms were moving across the region this morning, bringing wind gusts of up to 60 mph that likely will damage roofs, siding, and trees, the NWS said.
