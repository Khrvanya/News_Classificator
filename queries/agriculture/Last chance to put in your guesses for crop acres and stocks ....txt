Re: Last chance to put in your guesses for crop acres and stocks before tomorrow.
So regional, even county to county. In our little pocket, corn is head high and beans at full canopy on June 30th. Just crazy what day after day at 86 degrees does to growth rates. Lots of areas struggling. I just doubt NASS will find many acreage shifts from intentions. Probably a non-event for the first time in a while.
It is always weather 5 minutes after this report is released anyway.
Only bullish thing that could happen would be less bean acres and that makes it bullish beans.
