In a statement April 14, the new Agriculture Financial Services Corporation (AFSC) board said it will “provide essential oversight to ensure the agency’s programs and services are delivered effectively and meet the needs of rural Alberta.”
With farmers in Alberta having gone through one of the toughest harvests in recent memory, the needs of Alberta’s agricultural community have evolved. Service standards and responsiveness have been identified as key improvements for AFSC.
AFSC is guided by a board of directors whose knowledge and experience is key to its success. The new board members represent a broad and diverse cross-section of the industry to ensure the best service for Alberta agribusinesses.
These new appointees have been in place since April 12, replacing board members whose terms are expiring. The new appointments reflect government’s commitment to streamline the AFSC to improve its services and responsiveness to farmers.
