CHICAGO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures ended mixed for the trading week ending April 24, with COVID-19 shutdowns continuing to hurt demand for corn and causing oversupply.
Corn tumbled as stay-at-home rules in response to the pandemic have kept motorists off roads, hurting demand for ethanol. This year is expected to see massive U.S. corn oversupply unless demand is improved. In addition, a near-normal pace of U.S. corn seeding is set to begin in the opening week of May.
The Agricultural Research Council estimated that 2019/20 demand for ethanol would be 4.5 billion bushels - 550 million bushels below the U.S. Department of Agriculture's April World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates.
U.S. wheat futures ended lower as coming rainfall in Western Europe weighed on investors. Dryness concerns in Europe are easing as soaking rain lies ahead for France, Germany and Scandinavia.
CBOT soybean futures were overall steady. To date, U.S. export sales remain slow with ship lineup data indicating that just 16 million to 19 million bushels of soybeans are to be inspected for export on Monday.
AgResource, a Chicago-based agricultural research firm, expects that by Sunday, farmers will have planted 7 percent to 9 percent of the U.S. soybean crop, helped by solid planting progress across the western U.S. Midwest last week. This year's soy harvest is expected to be 625 million to 675 million bushels larger than it was in 2019.
Market analysts hold that bearish trends will persist in commodities amid the world's economic collapse due to COVID-19. A vaccine is needed to restore consumer confidence and prior spending habits. Enditem
