Soybean Futures Rise Overnight; Weekly Export Sales Lower Across the Board.
Soybeans were higher in overnight trading as China sought supplies of U.S. agricultural products this week.
China on May 5 purchased 378,000 metric tons of soybeans from the U.S., of which 136,000 tons were scheduled for delivery in the current marketing year and the rest set for shipments in the 2020-2021 year that starts on Sept. 1, according to the Department of Agriculture.
Yesterday, the Asian nation bought 686,000 metric tons worth of corn including 371,000 tons for delivery this marketing year and the rest for delivery after Sept. 1, the USDA said.
Freeze and frost warnings have been issued heading into the weekend for much of the Midwest, which puts plants that have started growing at risk. That’s also underpinning soybean and grain prices.
Soybean futures rose 5 to $8.49½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soymeal gained $1 to $289.10 a short ton and soy oil added 0.30¢ to 26.56¢ a pound.
Corn futures for May delivery rose 1¢ to $3.19 a bushel.
Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1¢ to $5.21½ a bushel overnight, and Kansas City futures added ¼¢ to $4.79 a bushel.
