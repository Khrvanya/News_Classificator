Arcata Recreation is accepting enrollment for summer farm shares from Bayside Park Farm.
Bayside Park Farm is a three-acre vegetable farm located in the city of Arcataâ€™s Bayside Park, which is dedicated to cultivating connections between the community and sustainable agriculture. The Bayside Park Farm share program was the first Community Supported Agriculture program in Arcata and has provided the community with local, organic produce for over 20 years.
Farm share enrollment is currently available for weekly pick-ups beginning in June. Bayside Park Farm is located at 930 Old Arcata Road, and full shares cost $500 for the growing season, which lasts 21 weeks from June to November. Early enrollment is encouraged as shares are limited, and payment plan options are available.
