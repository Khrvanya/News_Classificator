In a series of tweets on Saturday, Sitharaman also said banks have given the three-month loan moratorium facility to around 3 crore farmers for loans totalling Rs 4.22 lakh crore. “Since March 2020, 9.13 crore farmers have been paid Rs 18,253 crore under PM-KISAN during the #lockdown. About three crore farmers with agri loans totaling Rs 4,22,113 crore availed the benefit of the 3-month loan moratorium,” the minister said on her twitter handle. The government provides each farmer Rs 6,000 of income support annually in three instalments into their bank accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme.
On March 27, the Reserve Bank of India had announced moratorium by banks on term loans that were scheduled for payments between March 1 and May 31.

Working capital limit of Rs 6700 cr has been sanctioned for procurement of agriculture commodities to State Govt entities since Mar, 2020,” the tweet said.
