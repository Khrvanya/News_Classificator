USDA releases expected corn ending stocks, creating little market reaction
For 2020/2021 marketing year, corn ending stocks are significantly high.
INDIANOLA, Iowa — The U.S. corn pile is growing but not as large as expected, at least for this marketing year, the USDA reported Tuesday.
In its May Supply/Demand and WASDE Reports, the USDA pegged this year’s U.S. corn average yields at 178.5 bushels per acre. If realized it would produce a crop size of 15.995 billion bushels.
Because the USDA released corn numbers that have already been built into the market, the corn prices didn’t have much of a reaction to the new data.
At the close, the July corn futures finished 3 3/4¢ higher at $3.22 3/4. Dec. corn futures settled 1¢ higher at $3.35 1/4.

Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that the May USDA Crop Report hopefully sets the tone for the year, as it did last year.
"With anticipation of large stocks, funds short, and no shortage of grain, demand was the key to this report. For the current crop year, ethanol usage was reduced but only by 100 million bushels and corn exports increased 50 million bushels.  But, for the 2020/2021, crop exports are anticipated to increase 375 million bushels. And, the USDA looks for an increase in ethanol demand. With an optimistic demand outlet on this report, the weather and Chinese purchases will set the tone until the June report," Roose says.
Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that today's reports are fair and in line with trade expectations.
“The cuts to old crop demand for Soybeans, Corn, and Wheat were expected as were the production increases for next year.  I have no argument with any of the numbers presented today.  The market feels that maybe the old crop corn is a bit bullish, but overall the market reaction has been rather muted due to the fact that these numbers are in line with the trade expectations and have been traded for a long time,” Scoville says.
Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that today’s WASDE was unexpectedly non-eventful.
“In corn, higher feeding offset some of the lost demand for ethanol, but overall trend line yields and confirmation of a huge 97 million acre U.S. planted corn number does little to change balance sheet expectations that were already in the market. Record global use of corn, soybeans and wheat for the coming 20/21 crop year is offset by projections of surplus production, leaving the future of forward prices again entirely at the mercy of weather. At this point, perfect production metrics are confirmed, and steady global grain consumption growth continues even with the effects of COVID-19 factored into the equation,” Gilbertie says.
