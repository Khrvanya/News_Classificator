The Agriculture Ministry has ordered its officials across the country to hold campaigns to encourage people made jobless during the spread of COVID-19 to take up farming.
In a letter signed on Thursday, Agriculture Minister Veng Sakhon outlined measures which need to be taken to boost the agricultural sector during border lockdowns due to COVID-19.
He said the agricultural sector is key to kick starting the country’s economy during these hard times.
“Cambodia’s economy has been affected by the disease [COVID-19] and may decrease to 1.9 percent in 2020,” the letter said.
Mr Sakhon said officials should encourage people to do farming by providing support on farming techniques and also provide solutions to problems they may encounter.
He said the campaign is aimed at improving the employment rates and livelihoods of people, especially migrant workers who have returned to their home provinces during the pandemic.
