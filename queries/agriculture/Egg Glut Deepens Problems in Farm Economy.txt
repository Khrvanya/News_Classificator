Shares in top egg producer Cal-Maine Foods take a hit, as per-dozen prices decline
Too many hens laying too many eggs are pushing down prices for the consumer staple, hurting sales at producers such as Cal-Maine Foods Inc. and adding more stress to the U.S. farm economy.
Jackson, Miss.-based Cal-Maine, the nation’s top egg producer, said Monday that prices for its eggs fell 30% to about 92 cents a dozen in its quarter that ended Aug. 31. The result cut Cal-Maine’s sales by 29%, year over year.
