In 2019, the volume of labour deployed in the Dutch agricultural sector was equivalent to over 156 thousand full-time jobs (FTEs). Included were nearly 30 thousand full-time jobs of people working on the basis of fixed-term contracts, doing specific or occasional work. This is evident from the agricultural census conducted by Statistics Netherlands (CBS).
The majority of the non-regular labour force - often seasonal workers - were active in horticulture. Especially during planting and harvesting times, more temporary manpower is needed in this sector. The horticultural sector accounted for almost 26 thousand full-time jobs of non-regularly employed persons, nearly 87 percent of these types of jobs in agriculture.
