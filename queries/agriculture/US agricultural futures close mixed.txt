CHICAGO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed mixed on Friday with corn rising, wheat falling and soybeans unchanged.
The most active corn contract for July delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.68 percent, to settle at 3.3125 U.S. dollars per bushel. July wheat fell 8.5 cents, or 1.62 percent, to end at 5.1525 dollars per bushel. July soybeans remained unchanged at 8.6775 dollars per bushel.
CBOT brokers estimated that funds bought 5,100 contracts of corn and 1,200 contracts of soybeans, while selling 3,200 contracts of wheat.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Foreign Agricultural Service reported the sale of 588,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans to an unknown buyer.
Fund short covering in corn has been the feature in the last few days. While the fundamentals are ultra-bearish for corn, the July Midwest weather pattern is being debated.
A warm and mostly dry weekend is forecast for the U.S. Midwest and Plains. After Tropical Storm Cristobal makes the U.S. shore early Monday, the latter part of the week will see sunny weather with chances of rain improving in the following 11 to 15 days. There is no indication that heat and dryness in the U.S. Midwest will last into late June. Enditem
