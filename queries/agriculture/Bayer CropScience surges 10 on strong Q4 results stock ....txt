Shares of Bayer CropScience surged 10 per cent to Rs 4,875, also its fresh 52-week high, on the BSE on Tuesday after the company reported profit before exceptional items and tax (PBET) of Rs 54.3 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 (Q4FY20), on the back of strong operational performance.

The management said a good monsoon in 2019 ensured sufficient water reserves for Rabi sowing. "This coupled with stable commodity prices, favorable climate and strong portfolio performance in corn and horticulture, helped us achieve strong growth in Q4", they said.
With the ongoing Covid-19 situation, the external business environment remains uncertain in the short term. However, agriculture and food production will continue to be essential for good health and nutrition. The transformational agri-reforms announced by the government will help India become more self-reliant and food secure, they said.
The management further said that going forward, the company will focus on new business models and value chain collaborations to expand the reach of our agri-solutions, support scale-up of FPOs and digital farming solutions.
