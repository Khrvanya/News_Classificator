New Delhi: The ongoing slowdown has left everyone to ponder over when normalcy will return in businesses and the economies.
ET NOW's webinar on Friday (May 8), long term equity investor and commodity guru Jim Rogers speaks about why he thinks that the world is headed towards 'the worst bear market of his lifetime' in the coming years.
Speaking about the current global situation, he said that " In 2008, the world had a problem because of too much debt. Since then, the debt has skyrocketed everywhere. Even in India and China, everywhere. Ten years ago China had no debt now it has a lot of debt. And next time we have a problem...that we are having now. It will be the worst in my lifetime."
He further cautioned that considering countries are printing money as fast as they and are investing in the markets. But eventually, with the debt touching the roof,  money printing happening everywhere, we are ultimately going to pay the price.
On asking, what should be people invest in the given market situation, he said that this is the best time to invest in metals like silver and gold. "Make sure you have some gold. Most of the Indians have some gold."
