The transition to a climate neutral economy is one of the greatest challenges for the EU. Farmers and fishermen will play a crucial role in achieving this important goal. But they will need help. Our future policies have to ensure fair transition and decent living. In the meantime, European farmers deserve certainty and predictability. With that in mind, we need to reach an agreement on CAP transitional rules as soon as possible, and keep the old rules functioning during the transitional period. Nobody should be left behind.
In a public session the Commission present–µd its communication 'The European Green Deal' published on 11 December 2019. 'The Farm to Fork' strategy and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are identified in the communication as the main tools to help farmers and fishermen fight climate change, protect the environment and preserve biodiversity.
Following the presentation, ministers held a discussion about the agricultural aspects of the European Green Deal based on a steering note prepared by the presidency.
