Kate Forbes MSP has urged people to take part in a new Holyrood consultation that could lead to tougher penalties for dog owners whose pets attack livestock on farms.
A private member’s bill has been tabled before the Scottish Parliament by Emma Harper MSP and it calls for additional powers for investigation and enforcement of such crimes as well as increasing the maximum penalties for offenders.
The draft law is now being considered by the Scottish Parliament’s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee.
Members of the public have been asked to submit their views by email to rec.committee@parliament.scot by Friday August 28.
Ms Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said: ‘I have previously been very vocal about sheep worrying and there is now an opportunity for farmers, crofters and anybody else with an interest in the matter to contribute their thoughts.
‘This is a call for evidence, and doesn’t determine the final legislation but is an opportunity to make your views known.
According to statistics, the number of offences of dogs attacking livestock have increased by over 40 per cent between 2008-18.
More details on the committee’s call for evidence is available at: www.parliament.scot/S5_Rural/General%20Documents/Call_for_Evidence.pdf
