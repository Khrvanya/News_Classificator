New cracks have appeared in Chinaâ€™s egg market, the result of an uptick in production and a drop in meat prices at the end of 2019.
Since November, prices of one-month egg futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange have fallen 45% to about 2983 yuan ($433.73) a metric ton. That means they have largely erased an 81% gain last year that followed increases in pork and other meat prices in China.
