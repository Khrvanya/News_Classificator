Wheat futures headed higher on Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its ending stocks forecast for the 2019/2020 marketing year by 40 million bushels to 974 million bushels, the lowest in five years. The USDAâ€™s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report also lowered U.S. wheat import expectations by 15 million bushels to 105 million bushels "on a slower than expected pace to date." That would be the lowest imports in 9 years, the report said. Meanwhile, the report left its U.S. corn supply and use outlook unchanged for the 2019/2020 marketing year. Still, Sal Gilbertie, president and chief investment officer at Teucrium Trading, said the report "re-confirms that for the third year in a row, global use of corn will exceed production." The market "will be looking to January to see if the USDA adjusts corn numbers, given that there are estimates of perhaps 1 billion bushels of corn still in the fields, some of which will be lost, which means corn production figures could be lowered," he said. March wheat wh20 rose 4 cents, or 073%, to $5.27 3/4 a bushel. March corn ch20 added a cent, or 0.3%, to $3.76 3/4 a bushel.
