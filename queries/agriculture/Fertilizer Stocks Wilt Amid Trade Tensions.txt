Shares of farm-supply companies came under further pressure Tuesday following disappointing quarterly results from fertilizer maker Mosaic Co. amid an escalation in the U.S.-China trade fight.
Farm-supply companies have fallen this week after Beijing said it would suspend all imports of U.S. agricultural goods, a retaliatory measure to President Trumpâ€™s decision to impose new tariffs of 10% on roughly $300 billion of imports from China.
