Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that today’s USDA/WASDE numbers, themselves, are maybe a little bearish, when compared to expectations.
“But, they are not price-negative to the point that we are never going to have an uptick again.  I think yields will eventually come down more, as they do not jive with what I am hearing from the country.  Beans maybe a lot more, corn should come down more and maybe into the lower 160’s.  The soybean ending stocks are down into a realistic area, corn ending stocks disappointing.
Scoville added, “There was a positive reaction to the reports and I am hoping for a strong close.  We have already factored in these kinds of numbers from the August reports. So now, we can rally a bit.  Might still go lower at harvest but for now I think a short term pop is in order if not more,” Scoville says.
