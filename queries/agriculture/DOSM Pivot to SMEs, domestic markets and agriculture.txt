The Department of Statistics (DOSM) has recommended that policy measures encourage small and medium enterprise (SME) transformations and focus on both the domestic market and agriculture sector.
In its second edition of the Malaysian Economic Statistic Review for 2020, which looked at economic data for the first quarter of the year, DOSM said the Covid-19 pandemic minimises the chances of investments from abroad and hence there was a need to focus on stimulating domestic investments.
