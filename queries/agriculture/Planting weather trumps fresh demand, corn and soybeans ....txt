Export sales of 136,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to China during the 2019/2020 marketing year.
Export sales of 125,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to Mexico. Of the total, 39,000 metric tons is for delivery during the 2019/2020 marketing year and 86,000 metric tons is for delivery during the 2020/2021 marketing year.
Export sales of 589,395 metric tons of corn for delivery to Mexico. Of the total, 369,600 metric tons is for delivery during the 2019/2020 marketing year and 219,795 metric tons is for delivery during the 2020/2021 marketing year.
The marketing year for corn and soybeans began Sept. 1.
Tom White, TWA Trading, says that the corn market is falling, due to investors' concerns about global uncertainty.
"As the week is coming to a close, investors have been hitting corn and other commodities and rightfully so. There is no help coming from the oil market, combined with the global uncertainty," White says.
For price direction, TWA Trading sees a temporary key level in July corn futures at $3.17 1/2 per  bushel.
"Trading below that level will test the downside price at $3.10. On the upside, if we can get corn to trade above $3.30, we will gain footing and corn will trade up to $3.41. But, these are the scenarios we can expect," White says.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that good planting weather will keep a lid on rallies.
“We saw some soybean purchases from China this week, and heard rumors of some large corn purchases; this had the bulls trying to stage a rally. As we wrap up another week, expect grain prices to be a bit lower. We will likely see a good chunk of corn getting planted this weekend,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “Rallies in the corn and soybean market will be hard to sustain. Until we start seeing demand pick up from exports, feed demand, or ethanol, our rallies will be very limited and not last very long. The U.S. corn and soybean crops are going in at a good pace and under great conditions.”
On Thursday, the CME Group’s farm markets managed to settle higher.
At the close, the May corn futures finished 1 3/4¢ higher at $3.19 1/4. July corn futures finished 1 1/4¢ higher at $3.26 1/2.
May soybean futures closed 4 1/2¢ higher at $8.39 1/2. July soybean futures closed 4 1/4¢ higher at $8.46 1/2.
July wheat futures ended 1¢ higher at $5.44 3/4.
July soymeal futures settled $0.20 per short ton lower at $293.10. July soy oil futures closed $0.05 cent higher at 26.04¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $3.14 per barrel higher at $16.92 per barrel, the U.S. dollar is higher, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 174 points higher.
On Thursday, private exporters reported to the USDA export sales of 272,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to China during the 2019/2020 marketing year.
The marketing year for soybeans began September 1.
Separately, the USDA’s Weekly Export Sales Report Thursday shows weak demand figures.
Corn: 782,600 metric tons (mt) vs. the trade’s expectations of between 700,000 and 1.4 mmt
Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that today’s markets are reflective of yesterday when both corn and soybeans tested very key support levels at $3.01 per bushel and $8.10 per bushel, respectively.
“Both markets were able to find support and further buying. Soybeans managed to put in a key reversal with corn closing just 4¢ lower. As we have moved through the week, both of those markets have had continued strength. Corn was able to break through the $3.18 level and beans recovered 40¢ off of its lows. Rumors that China is sniffing around for both corn and soybeans, actual sales realized today in our weekly export report, gave continued strength.  Both markets disappointed against expectations. China is rumored to be looking for 30 million tonnes of crops to add to its national stockpile. While we have a long way to go in reaching these levels, the timing seems prime,” O’Connell says.
She added, “U.S. corn and bean prices are near multiyear lows and China is running short on protein products with domestic corn pricing at the highest levels in 15 years. We will need to see a  dramatic change in either the supply or the demand side of the equation for any robust prices moves. As we near $3.30 vs. the July and $8.60 vs. the July bean futures prices, resistance has been found. Without the aforementioned change in balance sheet, I would not expect a large change in prices. View any rally as a selling opportunity.”
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors have more questions than answers regarding the farm markets.
“Corn enters today, after a very nice rally Wednesday. The support came from gasoline consumption picking up, which gave a boost to gas prices and ethanol. Corn prices have been oversold for a while, so it did not take much to get a positive reaction. Wheat futures pulled back after building in some premium, with Russia looking to cut exports along with some potential damage done to the U.S. winter wheat crop,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “As the U.S. and other countries slowly start to open up their economies, we will start seeing demand pick up for commodities again. It will be a slow recovery, however. When will the U.S. dollar reflect the distribution of U.S. stimulus money and push lower? This would make U.S. commodities cheaper to the rest of the world.”
On Wednesday, the CME Group’s farm markets responded positively to China’s fresh soybean purchase.
At the close, May corn futures finished 8½¢ higher at $3.17½; July corn futures ended 7½¢ higher at $3.24¾.
May soybean futures settled 4¢ higher at $8.34½; July soybean futures closed 1¾¢ higher at $8.42½.
July wheat futures ended 2½¢ lower at $5.43¼.
July soy meal futures closed $1.60 per short ton lower at $292.90. July soy oil futures finished 0.23¢ higher at 25.99¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $2.44 per barrel higher at $14.01 per barrel, the U.S. dollar is higher, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 494 points higher.
On Tuesday, private exporters reported to the USDA export sales of 198,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to China during the 2019/2020 marketing year.
The marketing year for soybeans began September 1.
The U.S. production of ethanol hit a record low, while stocks hit a record high last week.
On Wednesday, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) released its weekly Ethanol Production Report.
In the report, the EIA pegged ethanol production at a record-low 563,000 barrels, down 7,000 from a week ago and down 46% vs. a year ago.
Meanwhile, ethanol stocks built to a record high of 220,000 barrels.
Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says today’s trade may be led by an oversold corn market.
“The headlines are that China bought up to a half million tons of beans, but corn is the mover and not beans. Corn was very oversold and due an up move, I guess, while beans reacted yesterday,” Scoville says.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors are eyeing a low in the energy market.
“The sell-off in crude oil continued Tuesday. This put pressure on corn. Grain traders are becoming more concerned that an extended period of weakness in the energy sector will do long-term damage to U.S. grain balance sheets. Ethanol and RBOB have not made new contract lows on the recent weakness, but prices are getting very close to those levels,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “May grain options expire on Friday. We have seen option expiration days set an extreme before the market reverses the trend. Continue to watch the daily chart for higher highs and higher lows.”
On Tuesday, the CME Group’s farm markets witnessed the soybean complex turn around and close higher.
At the close, May corn futures settled 5¢ lower at $3.09; July corn futures ended 5¢ lower at $3.17¼.
May soybean futures closed 4¼¢ higher at $8.30¾; July soybean futures closed 4½¢ higher at $8.40¾.

July soy meal futures finished $3.70 per short ton higher at $294.50. July soy oil futures finished 0.61¢ lower at 25.76¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $46.69 per barrel higher at $9.06 per barrel, the U.S. dollar is higher, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 555 points lower.
On Monday, the crude oil market price traded below zero for the first time ever, due to a lack of storage for oversupplies.
Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says the farm markets remain bearish.
“Fresh contract lows today were set in corn and soybeans, as friendly news is as rare as crude oil storage. Slow export demand, nonthreatening weather, and the concern of the overall domestic demand are raising questions. Lower feed usage to lower ethanol demand and slow farmer selling continue to apply pressure to prices. Eventually, risk premium will be added as planters hit the Midwest. The crude oil crash and planting weather will be the dominant news items giving direction,” Roose says.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors are shocked about the negative crude oil market.
“Whoever thought we would see crude oil trade below $10 per barrel? Or that it could go negative? The negative price on the expiring May contract tells us that crude oil producers in the U.S. are running out of storage room. Now they have to pay to have the oil taken from them,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “On Monday, crude oil prices plunged. The expiring May contract dropped to new all-time lows, trading at -$40 per barrel before closing down -$37 per barrel. (That is not a typo. Those are negative numbers.) The June contract closed at $20.43. The collapse in the crude oil market put pressure on the grain markets, while wheat managed to close higher.”
On Monday, the CME Group’s wheat market is rallying off of Russia’s news of banning exports.
At the close, May corn futures finished 8¢ lower at $3.14; July corn futures closed 7¢ lower at $3.22.
May soybean futures settled 6¢ lower at $8.26¾; July soybean futures closed 6¢ lower at $8.36¼.
July wheat futures ended 13¾¢ higher at $5.47½.
July soy meal futures finished $2.30 per short ton lower at $290.80. July soy oil futures settled 0.30¢ lower at 26.37¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $32.07 per barrel lower at -$13.80, the U.S. dollar is higher, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 592 points lower.
The crude oil market price traded below zero for the first time ever, due to a lack of storage for oversupplies.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says the corn market may be putting in a low.
“The corn market may be putting in a low. It’s bearish out there. We know corn being used for ethanol is an ongoing problem, and we know crude oil is at the lowest price this morning since 1988. However, the corn market was able to close higher on Thursday and Friday. The corn market is oversold on the daily and weekly chart, and the bull spreads have started to work. Now a close above the two-day high at $3.25½ will signal a possible change of trend in the corn market,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “Two major reports come out this week. First, the USDA Crop Progress Report this afternoon. We expect U.S. corn planting to be reported at 8% complete, about 4 points behind normal. The second big report will be the Energy Information Agency Report on Wednesday, which will show gasoline demand starting to increase.”
