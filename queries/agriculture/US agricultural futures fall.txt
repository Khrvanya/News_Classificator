CHICAGO, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed lower on Monday as corn, wheat and soybeans all fell.
The most active corn contract for July delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 3.02 percent, to close at 3.1325 U.S. dollars per bushel. July wheat lost 5.75 cents, or 1.08 percent, to settle at 5.2475 dollars per bushel. July soybeans declined 3 cents, or 0.36 percent, to end at 8.365 dollars per bushel.
CBOT traders estimate that funds have sold 4,800 contracts of corn, 2,700 contracts of wheat and 900 contracts of soybeans.
Corn has been falling as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps cars in garages and hurts demand for ethanol, causing an oversupply of both the crop and the fuel. Wheat is down as export demand fades following the filling of Russia's quota system. Soybeans have been waiting for signs of China demand.
China will be on its Labor Day holiday later this week and traders are watching to see if fresh U.S. soybean purchases will be made early this week.
For the week ending April 23, the United States exported 42.4 million bushels of corn, 20.4 million bushels of soybeans and 18.4 bushels of wheat, beating trade expectations.
For respective crop years to date, the United States has exported 878 million bushels of corn, down 486 million bushels or 36 percent; and 1,230 million bushels of soybeans, up 72 million bushels or 6 percent. Wheat exports to date have come to 827 million bushels, down 41 million bushels or 5 percent.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) maintains that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is overstating 2019/2020 U.S. corn exports by 50 million bushels and soybeans by 100 million to 150 million bushels.
ARC was looking for U.S. corn seeding to reach 24 percent to 26 percent Monday afternoon, a slightly quicker-than-expected pace amid progress in the western Midwest. U.S. spring seeding is expected to progress normally during early May. U.S. soybean seeding should accelerate by mid-May. Enditem
