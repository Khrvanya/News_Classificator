Don Roose of U.S. Commodities believes the fallback in soybean futures is driven by forecasts for rain over the weekend in parts of South America that have been dry.
“I think that’s as big as anything else,” he says, noting that harvest in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso is only about three weeks away, although planting is still in progress far to the south in Argentina.
Other factors are technical signals that soybean futures may be overbought as well as a pause in short covering by funds ahead of the weekend.
Although there are no solid details to confirm it, some traders now believe that wheat may benefit more than soybeans from a trade deal with China, Roose says.
“The thinking is that China will buy more wheat, rice, and corn than pork and soybeans to feed their people,” he says.

“The wheat market’s leading the way,” says Don Roose of U.S. Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The belief is that China’s going to continue to buy wheat. That’s underpinning the market.”
The USDA’s Weekly Export Sales Report was released this morning, one day after the normal release due to the Christmas holiday. It shows a drop from sales levels of the previous week for corn, wheat, and soybeans. Sales for the period December 13-19 were:

Jake Hanley, managing director and portfolio manager at Teucrium Trading, sees soybean futures still under the influence of a potential U.S.-China trade deal early next year.
“For soybeans, the Chinese tone on trade continues to be positive, and there is talk of some continued short covering,” he says. “Beans might take a bit of a pause at the close by technical resistance levels.”
“The fundamental story on wheat hasn’t changed and talk that continued support for wheat is based on good exports, low U.S. acres planted, and positive trade developments,” Hanley says. “Today’s move may be more technical in nature.”
Jack Scoville, senior analyst with PRICE Futures Group, agrees that optimism over a China trade deal continues to drive soybean futures higher.
“It seems to be follow-through fund-type buying on ideas that the trade accord is coming sooner rather than later,” he says. “That’s supporting most markets here today. China said all that was needed was the final translation and legal work to get done and then it can be signed. The deal should turn out good for both sides since the Chinese need food and we certainly have it to sell.”
“Beyond that the big story is in wheat,” he adds. “Wheat futures up and completing what looks to be a bull flag formation as much as anything fundamental.”

That wraps up a relatively quiet day in futures trading.
“It’s been very quiet and rangebound so far,” says Jack Scoville, senior analyst at PRICE Futures Group. “We got some selling above from producers but not much at all. There was some spec buying but, once again, not all that much around.”
“The fundamentals of demand are still good despite the Brazil crops and things like that,” he says, “but the market appears to have very limited interest and upside potential for the week. Maybe there will be more next week.”
At midday Monday, soybeans continue their rally while corn is up only slightly and wheat futures are down.
Does that mean Rudolph the red-nosed bull is going to pull a sledload of soybean futures into the stratosphere before Christmas?
Don Roose of U.S. Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa, says the direction of soybean and corn futures today is driven mostly by commodity funds exiting short positions ahead of the Christmas holiday. That short covering adds upward pressure to futures prices. Funds are long wheat, and as they unwind those positions, they’re adding downward pressure to wheat futures prices.
So far, the impact of the announced trade deal between the U.S. and China has been modest.
“It’s a holiday market, so typically you have less trade influence because not as many people are participating,” Roose says.
Although China has announced reduced tariffs on frozen pork and other U.S. exports, starting in the new year, the trade agreement hasn’t been signed yet, Roose points out.
“We haven’t seen any real details,” he says.
The likelihood of a good harvest from crops still being planted in parts of South America also puts a drag on bullish sentiment.
“The weather in South America continues to improve, and it looks like Brazil is off to a record soybean crop,” Roose says.
Going into the new year, the futures traders will continue to watch for details on U.S.-China exports and will anticipate the January 10 USDA crop report, which could lower estimates of the U.S. corn and soybean harvests.
