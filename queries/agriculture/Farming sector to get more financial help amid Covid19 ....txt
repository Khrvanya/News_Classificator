The department of agriculture has set aside a package of R1.2bn to address effects of the coronavirus and ensure sustainable food production after  the pandemic.
Speaking during a news conference on Tuesday, agriculture, land reform and rural development  minister Thoko Didiza said the department would make the details of this package available in the coming days, together with the application channels available. The department has also availed R100m to the Land Bank to assist farmers under distress.
The coronavirus has left the global economy reeling and stocks plummeting amid fears of a jobs bloodbath. The pandemic has also led to a decline in Asia’s agriculture demand and falling agricultural commodity prices.
In a bid to stop the spread of the virus, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a 21-day lockdown which will come into effect on Thursday midnight.
Didiza said while several businesses will be affected, the agriculture and food supply sector will remain operational during the lockdown.
“Our food supply system will remain functional during this period. Agricultural production in all its forms will remain uncompromised,” the minister said.
This includes all services including provision of veterinary and advisory services. Live auctions of livestock and sale of other agricultural commodities will continue but under the strict conditions a prescribed by the president, Didiza said.
She said exports and imports of critical agriculture commodities and the logistical measures will continue during the lockdown period to ensure global and national food security. This is not only limited to retailers but the entire food value chain, from farm related operations, agro-processing and food manufacturing, logistics and related services, wholesale and retail services, and all support functions that ensure efficient delivery of the agro-food system.
