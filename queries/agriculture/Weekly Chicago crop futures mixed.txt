CHICAGO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed mixed for the trading week ending June 19, as a risk-off mentality dominated the market on worries of COVID-19 resurgence.
Corn futures ended slightly higher in the week. Chicago-based consulting company AgResource said the seven-week rally is methodical and attributed the rally to short covering.
Thirty-day weather forecasts for the Central United States maintain a pattern of normal/above normal and above normal precipitation. If the forecasts are correct, corn will undergo pollination in nearly ideal conditions. The chances for U.S. corn yield to exceed 180 bushels per acre are rising, and this would require the market to find all available consumption in order to prevent 2020 U.S. corn ending stocks from nearing 4 billion bushels.
Wheat futures ended sharply lower against the backdrop of expanding harvest in the Northern Hemisphere. Wheat market may go lower, but with world wheat stock/use ratios at the lowest level since 2007/08, this is no place to be bearish, AgResource predicted.
Soybean futures closed higher for the fourth week in a row. Funds have been bullish for several weeks.
Fundamentally, little has changed for soybean futures in the last 30 days. China has made additional U.S. soybean purchases. The crop is well ahead of a year ago in terms of maturity with far better conditions. The National Agricultural Statistics Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture will release the Acreage and Grain Stocks report at the end of the month. Enditem
