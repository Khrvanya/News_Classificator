As a majority of Indian industries and sectors are now feared to plummet into negative territory, agriculture may be the only one to register growth this year.
Right from helping farmers get a better price for their produce to also ensuring that consumers still pay a reasonable price for their food, agricultural reforms have a long way to go.
With India being under a lockdown for over a month now, several sectors are now staring at massive revenue losses and even degrowth. However, there is one sector which can absorb the shock of the coronavirus and deliver respectable growth. As a majority of Indian industries and sectors are now feared to plummet into negative territory, agriculture may be the only one to register growth this year, Ashok Gulati, Infosys Chair Professor for Agriculture at ICRIER, wrote in The Indian Express. However, the sector can do even better if the government implements some reforms in the sector which still houses Indiaâ€™s largest workforce.
Right from helping farmers get a better price for their produce to also ensuring that consumers still pay a reasonable price for their food, agricultural reforms have a long way to go. In the tough coronavirus times, while several states such as Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh ensured that their wheat farmers got a decent price for their produce, wheat farmers from eastern UP and Bihar got low prices.
