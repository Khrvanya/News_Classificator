How do you feel about the proposals?
After Brexit, the UK’s food security is to be regularly assessed by parliament to ensure minimal disruption to supplies while new trade deals are being sought , outlined in a new agriculture bill, introduced to parliament on Thursday.
British agriculture is facing the biggest shakeup in 40 years, and the bill requires a regular report to MPs outlining supply sources and household expenditure on food, as well as consumer confidence in food safety.
The move reflects concerns over potential disruptions post-Brexit, as more than a quarter of Britain’s food comes from the EU and nearly a fifth from other countries.
We want to hear from UK farmers: what is your reaction to the new agriculture bill? How do you feel about the proposals? What are your concerns and have you reported them? How are you preparing for the implications Brexit might cause for your business? What guidance have you been given?
