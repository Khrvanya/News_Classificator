The precision agriculture market is projected to grow from $5,068.6 million in 2019 to $11,106.7 million by 2025 at a CAGR of 13.97% during the same time period. High growth in the market is expected to be driven by the need to effectively apply site-specific farming solutions to manage raw materials and resources, as per requirements. The deployment of automation, along with control and sensing systems, to steer the application of agricultural inputs is expected to augment the growth of the market.
Precision agriculture is also expected to reduce the ecological footprint of daily farming.In emerging countries, growth is expected to be driven by rising awareness among governments of different countries about the need to elevate farm produce while taking care of the environment.
Furthermore, rising concerns over global food security and sustainability have led to extensive investments by the government in terms of initiatives and trade policies.
The exponential utilization of advanced solutions in the precision agriculture market has created opportunities for the companies to adopt strategies, such as collaborations, joint ventures, product launches, and development and partnerships.
The established companies in the precision agriculture market are focusing more on product launches and finding ways to improve the existing techniques.Moreover, acquisition activities have increased in the market during the last five years.
Presently, the big four agricultural companies, namely, Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, and BASF, are constantly increasing their investment for the digitization of the farming sector, by acquiring or collaborating with the data sciences company.
Several start-ups, such as CropX Inc., Gamaya, EarthSense, Kray technologies, and AgDraft, have launched different solutions to compete with the market-dominant players. The wide-spread adoption of advanced solutions and techniques is essential for linking the gap between the demand and supply of the food.
