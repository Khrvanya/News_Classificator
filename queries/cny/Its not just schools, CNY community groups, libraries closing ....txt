Several libraries, businesses and other organizations in Central New York are making announcements they are closing or canceling events due to heavy snow and winds.
There were a handful of schools that delayed this morning, and then decided to close. Many others just announced closings. Others are announcing the cancellation of after-school activities, and one college is cancelling afternoon classes.
Hereâ€™s the list of community organizations affected by the storm (click on the column headers if you want to sort the data in that column.) This list is likely to change today. We will update as more reports come in. Thanks.
