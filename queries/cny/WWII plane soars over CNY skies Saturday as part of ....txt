SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — A WWII relic was in the skies of Central New York Saturday afternoon to honor the healthcare workers fighting COVID-19 on the front lines, and all of the essential workers risking their lives every day.
Below is what the journey looked like from inside the plane:
Whiskey 7, a Douglas C-47 aircraft, was the lead aircraft in the second wave of the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944 over Ste. Mere Eglise, Normandy.
Now, as part of the National Warplane Museum in Geneseo, N.Y., Whiskey 7 will do a flyover of health facilities in Central and Western New York on Saturday, May 16.
It’s all part of Operation Thanks From Above.
Below is the flight itinerary for Saturday’s event as of Friday morning, May 15. The plan is for Whiskey 7 to be over Syracuse around 2:30 p.m.
Fortunately, it looks like the weather will cooperate Saturday afternoon for this great site.
Below is more on the history of Whiskey 7.
