SINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - Shanghai aluminium futures prices rose to their highest in nearly four weeks on Thursday as inventories in China fell and as expectations of supply cuts increased.
The most-traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) rose as much as 1.8% to 12,125 yuan ($1,713.76) a tonne, its highest since March 20. The contract closed at 12,085 yuan a tonne, up 1.5%.
Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was on track for its fourth straight session of gain, up 0.5% at $1,515.50 a tonne by 0701 GMT. The contract touched a two-week high in the previous session at $1,529 a tonne.
“Rising expectations of supply cuts have been driving the rally, along with a marginal improvement in the China market. This is evident with inventories in the local market declining, and anecdotal reports of stock replenishment,” analysts at ING bank said in a note.
