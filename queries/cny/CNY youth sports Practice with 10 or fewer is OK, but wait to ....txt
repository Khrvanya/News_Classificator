Syracuse, N.Y. — Small baseball, softball and soccer practices for youth sports are OK to do now, Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon said today. That means practices with 10 or fewer people.
“You can start to do these things,” McMahon said.
But hold off on restarting leagues and organized games, he added. Central New York county leaders are asking the state for guidance about organized youth sports. He added he understands people are anxiously awaiting a restart to sports amid coronavirus .
McMahon said he and other local leaders are encouraging Gov. Andrew Cuomo to start phase three on Friday so restaurants can open for inside, Friday night dining. Restaurants are the second-largest driver of sales tax money for the county, McMahon said. (Car sales are No. 1.)
David Hoyne has been helping frame the guidelines for the restart of indoor dining.
He said he’s also hopeful that Destiny USA and other malls will be able to reopen soon. “I believe we’re making progress,” McMahon said.
Since March 16, the county and state have recorded 161 deaths in Onondaga County related to the coronavirus. Overall, the county has 2,351 confirmed cases; 1,285 have recovered.
As of today, 57 people are hospitalized, with 12 in critical condition. The county has 910 known active cases.
The county’s three-day infection rate based on test results is at 0.8 percent, McMahon said. Today, the county recorded 15 new cases. “Let’s hope we can keep that up,” McMahon said of the low numbers.
Here’s a breakdown of confirmed cases by location. C means confirmed and R means recoveries:
