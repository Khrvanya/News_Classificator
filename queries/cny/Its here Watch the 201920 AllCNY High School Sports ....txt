Syracuse, N.Y. — The top high school athletes from the fall and winter sports seasons will be recognized today during the third annual All-CNY Sports Awards.
The ESPYs-inspired event, hosted by syracuse.com | The Post Standard reporter Brent Axe, will be held virtually for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic.
A pre-recorded video will be released at 10 a.m. on syracuse.com and allcnysports.com . Individual player of the year awards will be announced during the show along with a few special awards, including Coach of the Year, Team of the Year, the “Comeback Award,” and Overall Athletic Program of the Year.
Unfortunately, there will not be any awards for spring-sports athletes this year, but a group of seniors who earned All-CNY honors last year were highlighted to share their thoughts about missing their final high school seasons.
