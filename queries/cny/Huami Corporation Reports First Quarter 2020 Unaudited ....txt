COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact on the Chinese and the global economy in the first quarter of 2020. The quantity of our products manufactured reduced in January and February 2020 as our contracted manufacturing facilities were temporarily shut down. While these manufacturing facilities have been ramping-up since March, our supply chain, production, and sales in the first quarter of 2020 were all impacted, resulting lower than initially projected growth rates and gross margin. In the second quarter, the COVID-19 continues to impact global economy, including the demand of our products in oversea markets. We have reflected this impact within our view in the "outlook" section provided below, and we will monitor the COVID-19 impact continuously.
"Despite the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, brand recognition, new product launches and successful marketing spearheaded solid first quarter revenue growth of 36.1%," said Wang Huang, Chairman and CEO of Huami. "In addition to the aforementioned revenue drivers, we also made solid headway in international markets, with a keen focus on the market nuances of each key region and a multi-channel strategy including both direct sales and third-party sales channels.
"At this year's CES, we kicked off our brand extension initiative as we introduced new product categories, including ear buds and interactive treadmills. With these two categories in particular, we are taking another significant step in building a comprehensive health and fitness ecosystem as part of our 'Connect Health with Technology' aspirations. In terms of alliances, our continued partnership with Xiaomi remains productive with the launch of the Mi-Band 5 scheduled later in 2020. Additionally, we are very pleased to partner with the respiratory diseases team of Dr. Zhong Nanshan to jointly establish a laboratory for studies on monitoring respiratory diseases using wearable devices. With this, we expect to make contributions in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, and utilize our smart wearable devices to establish a cloud-based service system for epidemic prediction and early warning in the future. With our brand's rising popularity, our strengthening sales channels and new product and line extensions in the works, we are confident the underlying demand for our products remain strong and we will look to continue delivering sustainable growth and healthy profitability once the impact from the pandemic eases."
David Cui, Chief Financial Officer, added, "We rose to the challenge and are pleased with the resilience of our first quarter revenue growth during these uncertain times. We achieved solid unit sales of both self-branded products and Mi-Band 4, shipping 7.6 million units in the first quarter, a 35.7% rise from the same period last year. Despite of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that many other companies are also facing, we still kept our robust revenue growth, and remained profitable in this challenging time period. This was driven by increasing brand awareness and adoption of our products by users both domestically and in the overseas market.
"During the first quarter, we continue to push investments in both R&D and sales and marketing, as product innovation and sales channel integrity are key components of our success. While we have seen some shortage impacts on our product manufacturing due to disruptions to our supply chain during the quarter, we are optimistic of stronger profitability in the long term as the pandemic, along with its impact, runs its course."
Revenues increased by 36.1% to RMB1,088.5 million (US$153.7 million) from RMB799.6 million for the first quarter of 2019, driven by continued sales growth of Xiaomi and self-branded wearable products, despite the negative impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain.
Cost of revenues increased by 45.0% to RMB843.9 million (US$119.2 million) from RMB582.1 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Gross profit increased by 12.5% to RMB244.6 million (US$34.5 million) from RMB217.5 million for the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin was 22.5%, compared with 27.2% for the first quarter of 2019. The gross margin decrease was attributed to the change of product mix, and sales promotions in previous product versions, especially for Mi Band 4, in anticipation of the launch of a newer generation product.
Total operating expenses increased to RMB224.1 million (US$31.6 million) from RMB139.9 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Research and development expenses increased by 63.5% from RMB72.4 million in first quarter 2019 to RMB118.3 million (US$16.7 million) in first quarter 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of R&D staff and a rise in investment in healthcare related features, algorithms, cloud-services, chip research, and new products development to carry out our mission. We aim to launch a series of new products in the upcoming quarters of 2020.
General and administrative expenses increased by 12.3% from RMB45.3 in the first quarter 2019 to RMB50.9 million (US$7.2 million) in the first quarter 2020. This was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses and professional fees related to improving management operations, offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense and foreign exchange rate fluctuation.
Selling and marketing expenses increased by 147.2% from RMB22.2 million in first quarter 2019 to RMB54.8 million (US$7.7 million) first quarter 2020, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses, and an increase in advertising and promotional expenses for new market exploration and a series of new product releases. We hired more sales staff with heavy experience in overseas market expansion since 2019, and continue to carry out our plan during this year. In January 2020, we unveiled four new products spanning three verticals that go beyond smart bands and watches: Amazfit Home Studio, a smart gym hub; Amazfit AirRun, a foldable next-generation treadmill; Amazfit PowerBuds, true wireless stereo fitness earphones with Clip-to-Go design and; Amazfit ZenBuds, sleep-comfort and health monitoring earphones.

Income before income tax was RMB20.3 million (US$2.9 million), compared with RMB85.6 million for the first quarter of 2019.
