Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. reported earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock turned lower Thursday, despite the China-based e-commerce giant’s attempts to influence how its results were reported.

The company said that, in U.S.-dollar terms, net income was the equivalent of $1.31 billion, with earnings per share of 50 cents.
Alibaba provided “Non-GAAP diluted EPS,” which excludes nonrecurring items, and which reporters typically compare with analyst expectations, of RMB 8.04 — equivalent to $1.22 — up from RMB 7.95 a year ago.
