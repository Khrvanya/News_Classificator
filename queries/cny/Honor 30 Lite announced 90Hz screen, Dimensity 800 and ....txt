If you’re in the market for an affordable 5G phone you’re spoiled for choice. The latest offering is the Honor 30 Lite (aka Youth), which will be available in China starting on July 8 at a price of CNY 1,700 ($240/€215) for the base model.
The phone’s 5G prowess comes from the MediaTek Dimensity 800 chipset. With four Cortex-A76 and four A55 cores (all clocked at 2 GHz) plus a Mali-G57 MC4, this 7 nm chipset is no slouch.
The default configuration comes with 6GB of RAM and 64GB storage, the top-specced model is 8/128 GB. The phone runs Android 10 with Magic UI 3.1 out of the box (and it goes without saying: there are no Google services here).
On the front the Honor 30 Lite boasts a 6.5” LCD with 1080p+ resolution. It has 90 Hz refresh rate and 180 Hz touch sampling rate for smooth animation and instantaneous reactions. A 16 MP selfie camera is inside a teardrop notch on the top edge. It can be used for face unlock or you could use the side-mounted fingerprint reader instead.
Around back there’s a 48MP main camera with a large 1/2” sensor and f/1.8 aperture. To its left is an 8 MP ultrawide snapper, to its right a 2 MP depth sensor. The main cam can record 4K video with EIS and supports Super Night Mode.
The phone is powered by a 4,000 mAh battery, which can be charged at 22.5 W through the USB-C port (53% charge in 30 minutes). There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack here. Wireless connectivity features Wi-Fi 5 (ac) and two SIM slots.
Keep in mind that this phone supports only NM memory cards, so you’ll lose one of the SIM slots if you decide to expand the storage later on.
You can make a reservation on vmall for the phone, sales start on July 8 (next Wednesday). The base 6/64 GB model is CNY 1,700, you can double the storage for CNY 200 more or go for the top 8/128 GB version for CNY 2,200 total.
