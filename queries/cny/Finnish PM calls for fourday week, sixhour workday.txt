While the idea might seem far-fetched in countries accustomed to the standard nine-to-five, Northern European nations have challenged the status quo for some time.
The Swedish tech industry has been running a six-hour workday for some time, and corporate giants like Toyota have followed suit.
As far back as 2003, Toyota shifted its Gothenburg plant to shorter working days, boosting productivity.
Microsoft similarly saw productivity increase by 40 per cent when it tested a four-day week within its Japanese operation.
However, not everyone is a fan of the concept of shorter work hours. Tory member of the European Parliament Daniel Hannan criticised the four-day week in an op-ed written for the Telegraph last year. He called the four-day week "unaffordable, impossible [and] imaginary", saying that we simply couldn't sustain our current way of life with shorter work hours. His argument is that we don't currently have a shorter work week because people see value in working longer hours to live a bit better.
Closer to home, Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes made international headlines in 2018 when introducing the four-day week at his organisation, which employs over 200 people.
