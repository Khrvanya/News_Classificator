Some much needed rainfall fell across all of Central New York Saturday! No it wasn’t enough, but definitely helped the lawns, gardens and farmers somewhat. Roughly a quarter to three quarters of an inch of rain fell for most.
Below are many rainfall reports as of late Saturday evening from the National Weather Service Binghamton. Syracuse received another 0.13″ of rain early Sunday morning bringing the weekend rain total to almost three quarters of an inch of welcomed water!
Syracuse is still nearly 2 inches below average for the month of June despite the rain over the weekend! There’s a chance we could see a bit more rain Monday and more so Tuesday to round out the month, but overall the pattern looks to stay drier than not right through the week ahead.
We shall see where Syracuse ends up being ranked among the driest Junes on record when the month ends at midnight Tuesday night. As of Sunday night June 28th, Syracuse is tied for 7th driest on record.
