Syracuse, N.Y. — After nearly three months of restaurants being limited to takeout and delivery service only due to the coronavirus pandemic , on-premise outdoor dining is returning.
As of June 4, outdoor dining is now allowed in Central New York and the six other regions of the state that have reached phase two of New York’s restart plan.
There will be some changes: Tables must be six feet apart, staff must wear masks at all times and customers must wear masks when not seated.
Below is a growing list of restaurants that will be open today or this weekend for on-premise outdoor dining.
The table below will be updated as we receive more information and as more restaurants reopen their patios and other seating areas.
