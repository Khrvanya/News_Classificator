The dollar to yuan exchange rate is 7.09 as of 4:45 a.m, according to Markets Insider data.
Mark Le Dain, vice-president of strategy at Validere said: "The world typically does better when the US dollar appreciates less."
Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM added: "The US dollar is acting as a safe haven asset, if we get another outbreak, I see yuan ranging between 7.8 and 8.1 per dollar."
Other currencies particularly are at risk are the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, analysts said.
Aslam said: "The Japanese yen next door to China is also a big threat. Japan is the biggest holder of US treasuries."
Aslam said devaluation in yuan will boost the Chinese economy at the expense of other economies.
"China will become a more attractive place from an import point of view and it will strengthen the Chinese economy," he said.
Coghlan pointed out that the US-China phase one trade deal may be affected a result of the growing tensions.
China and the US agreed earlier this week to improve the atmosphere for the implementation of the phase one deal adding that both countries are expected to meet their obligations.
The US and China signed the phase one trade agreement in January this year after months of squabbling, but experts think the deal could still break through after the coronavirus has wrecked the US and China's economies, as well as global economies.
The exchange rate fell to a low of 6.27 in April 2018 , the year when the trade war began between both countries.
But Coghlan pointed out that China released a list of 79 US goods eligible for import waivers, signalling that both countries are keen to prevent another trade war.
But a persistent blame-game between both nations will keep yuan volatile in recent months.
