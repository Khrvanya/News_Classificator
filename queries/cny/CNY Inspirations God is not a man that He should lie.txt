Numbers 23:19. If we carefully study the Bible, we realize the will of God is not about us just trying to do well, especially regarding our sins. God knows we are unable to overcome sins on our own.
Therefore, God did not require anything of us, but He instead sent His son, Jesus Christ, to die in our place. Jesus received all the punishment of our sins. Now, God looks at us and sees us as white as snow because of the perfect work of Christ on the cross. God cannot look at us and call us sinners anymore; He calls us righteous. This was His promise to us. If God calls us sinners again, He is going back on His promise, an action that God cannot do. God is not a man that He should lie.
