Overall, New York’s population has declined over the last decade. The state has lost a net 1.4 million residents to other states since 2010, according to an analysis of migration patterns in IRS records.
Onondaga County’s population remains stable, but the region shares some of the competition with states that have better weather and lower taxes. The county’s population is about 460,500 – down from a height of 472,800 in 1970.
The numbers in the latest city and town release show changes within counties. Lakeside resorts grow while urban centers, even in rural counties, stabilize or decline.
The results of the 2020 Census, under way now, will determine the number of representatives New York has in Congress as well as the amount of federal money distributed to the state for affordable housing, anti-poverty and other programs.
IRS records hint at patterns. Sunshine and low property taxes not the only lures.
In the years leading up the 2010 census, Syracuse city leaders had been watching the population decline for 50 years. In 1950, the city had 220,600 residents. They feared the 2010 census would show the first drop below 140,000 since 1910.
City leaders were shocked when that didn’t happen. The 2010 count showed the city had lost only 1.5 percent of its population over 10 years.
The trend appears to have held steady for next last decade.
Syracuse lost another 2,900 residents from 2010 to 2019. That’s only 2 percent of the population.
The city’s population remains above 140,000 at 142,327.
People are looking beyond the oldest suburbs of Fayetteville, Manlius and Cicero for towns with more space, bigger houses and award-winning schools.
“I think this community is just a vibrant, safe community with good schools and that’s what makes us attractive and it’s very affordable to live here,” Lysander Supervisor Bob Wicks said.
The town offers a mix of vibrant village happenings in Baldwinsville and quiet country living without the overcrowding of Cicero or Clay, he said.
The Baldwinsville School District consistently ranks among the region’s best when it comes to test scores and graduation rates. Spending per student is the lowest in the county. The property tax rate is low.
It only takes Wicks about 17 minutes to drive from downtown Baldwinsville to downtown Syracuse. And, he said, more people are finding they can work locally or work remotely.
Across the state, the population has declined most severely in the small cities inside rural counties.
Utica, in Oneida County, has dropped below 60,000 for the first time since 1900. The city lost about 4 percent of its population over the last decade.
Auburn, in Cayuga County, has lost nearly 6 percent of its population since 2010.
In Oswego County, the city of Fulton has declined by 7 percent and Oswego City has dropped by 6 percent.
Population declined slightly in all of Upstate New York’s big four Thruway cities over the last decade. Albany lost only about 1.5 percent, while Rochester lost about 2.4 percent.
Only 170 places in New York had population increases from 2010 to 2019. Population declined in 835 places in New York state.
Ritzy lakeside towns and tourist regions increased in population.
The small town of Canandaigua gained 1,265 residents – an 11 percent increase.
Three of the top 10 in growth are in Saratoga County.
