Syracuse, N.Y. — Once again, it seems like Central New York jumped from winter right into summer without much of a spring.
Two weeks ago, snow fell in Syracuse. On Tuesday, we could see a record temperature of 90-plus degrees. The current record for May 26 is 90, set in 2011. The National Weather Service says we could meet or exceed that, as it’s going to be mostly sunny and calm.
There’s a slight chance of thunderstorms after 3 p.m. on Tuesday.
The weather will be warm and humid the rest of the week, with temperatures in the mid-80s each day through Friday. Starting Saturday, high temperatures will hover around 70 degrees.
