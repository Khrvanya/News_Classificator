The Clearing Corporation raised the initial margin on crude from 16.32% to 55.87% intraday to rein in excessive speculation amid huge volatility.
Mumbai: Many clients carrying overnight bullish positions on crude oil futures could struggle to meet their end-of-day mark-tomarket (MTM) obligations with crude plunging soon after opening at 9 am on commodity bourse MCX on Monday.
While brokers expect some defaults at the client level given that the price drop was more than the margin to trade at the beginning, a senior MCX Clearing Corporation (MCXCCL) official told ET that clearing of trades would happen seamlessly as the margins to trade had been increased in line with the excessive volatility.
MCX crude futures take price cues from WTI crude traded on Comex division of the CME, the worldâ€™s largest derivatives market place.
After opening at Rs 3,130 a barrel at 9 am, the active month crude futures contract kept hitting the lower circuit, tipping to a low of Rs 2,151, down a whopping 31.9% before noon.

"Client level defaults could be likely amid this huge volatility," said Narne. Agreed Nitin Kedia, director, Kedia Capital, who said a substantial number of clients were long the commodity as of Friday.
Indeed, data on MCX shows that the top 10 buyers on crude held an outstanding 12234 lots, or 12,23,400 barrels, against the outstanding 25,22,600 barrels held by the top 10 sellers on Friday.
