CRUDE OIL & GOLD TALKING POINTS:
Crude oil prices shot higher – briefly touching a three-month high – but momentum quickly fizzled, pushing the WTI benchmark back down to finish Tuesday’s session with a loss. A backdrop of weakening risk appetite seemed to account for the selloff.
All the tell-tale signs of risk aversion seemed present: bond yields drifted lower, the sentiment-geared Australian and New Zealand Dollar trimmed intraday gains while the anti-risk Japanese Yen tracked higher, and Wall Street backed away from session highs.
Interestingly, the US Dollar seemed unable to capitalize. It usually finds support from haven demand when markets turn defensive. A soggy set of US PMI figures may have played a part, with the manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrinking for a fourth month while services activity contracted faster than projected.
Lower bond yields against the risk-off backdrop coupled with an anchored Greenback allowed gold prices free rein to push upward. The yellow metal scored a third consecutive day of gains, advancing to the highest level in almost eight years.
The market mood seems to have soured further despite a modestly upbeat tone in Asia-Pacific trade. Bellwether S&P 500 futures are pointing sharply lower, suggesting crude oil may fall alongside shares as the trading wears on. Gold’s ability to capitalize will probably depend on how pressured USD remains.
