10% cut in crude oil allocations for September: Oman
Oman has told its crude oil term customers of a cut of about 10% in allocations for September loading and delivery, the oil ministry said on Wednesday.
The reduction, of which customers were notified on Tuesday, reflects the Gulf oil producer’s "100% commitment to the OPEC+ alliance by cutting 161,000 bpd, as of September 2020, from Oman’s quota," the ministry said.
