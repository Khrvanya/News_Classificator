Stocks Decline as Virus Risk Rises; Oil Gains: Markets Wrap
(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks dropped the most in more than a week amid a renewal of uncertainty over how quickly states can emerge from lockdowns. Oil rallied for a second day.
The S&P 500 fell 0.6% in volatile trading, led by declines in utilities, energy ad industrial shares. On the week, the benchmark index closed up 1.9%. Stocks had rallied amid reports that China plans to accelerate purchases of American farm goods to comply with the phase one U.S. trade deal, only to have the gains erased after data show record levels of Covid 19 in Florida and Arizona. Investors were whipsawed by bouts of volatility as a welter of options expired in a quarterly event know as quadruple witching.
“That’s a worrisome sign for markets,”said Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors. “This is a continuation of the first wave, this is not a second wave.”
In Europe, investors focused on negotiations over the EU’s proposed 750 billion-euro ($840 billion) program to help economies rebound from lockdowns, which helped send the Stoxx 600 Index up 0.6%.
Investors have been betting that governments will be able to put their economies back on track with enough stimulus at their disposal. U.S. and European benchmarks clawed back a portion of last week’s losses that were spurred by concern over a second wave of coronavirus infections.
Elsewhere, crude oil settled at the highest level in a week after briefly advancing beyond $40 a barrel.
