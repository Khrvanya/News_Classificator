The entire $23 billion process will ship natural gas from Africa to the global markets.
The Mozambique Liquefied Natural gas project by French firm, Total SA has started its initial process of finalizing the first $15 billion finance needed for its development.
According to Total , the construction period which started in August 2019 has a goal of rewarding $2.5 billion in contracts to indigenous Mozambican firms and will be the biggest private investment in Africa.
The project located at the Rovuma Basin will have approximately 65 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas with initial plans for two train project with scope to expand up to 43 million tonnes per annum.
The project requires a series of documents to be signed, a process that will take 3 days.
The entire $23 billion process will ship natural gas from Africa to the global markets and as many as 20 banks have been involved in the financing.
FDI to the continent fell 10% to $45 billion in 2019 according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and expects FDI to drop between 25%- 40% in 2020.

This was disclosed by Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) in a circular.
The Federal Government has announced an increase in the new pump price of Premium Motor Spirit, otherwise known as Petrol, to N143.80 per litre.
According to a monitored report, this was disclosed by Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) in a circular dated Wednesday, July 1, 2020, to oil marketers,
The statement from the circular says, ‘’After a review of the prevailing market fundamentals in the month of June and considering marketers’ realistic operating costs, as much as practicable, we wish to advise a new PMS pump price band of N140.80-N143.80 per litre for the month of July 2020.’’
The importation of petroleum products has remained a major financial burden to Nigeria.
A recent study by the Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) revealed that black market fuel refined in the creeks of the Niger Delta tends to have higher quality than the legally imported petrol and diesel imported into Nigeria from Europe.
Even though Nigeria has the capacity to pump over 2 million barrels a day of high grade “Bonny Light” crude, Nigeria’s refining capacity has been heavily reduced to nothing due to the dysfunctional state of four of Nigeria’s refineries which are managed by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC.
In the meantime, the importation of petroleum products has remained a major financial burden to Nigeria, even as the NNPC continues to spend billions of naira to maintain the loss-making refineries.
Note that Nigeria imports about 900,000 tons of low-grade European fuel mainly refined in Belgium and Netherlands which has led to horrible air pollution in Nigeria’s major cities.
The report found out that the fuel imported by Nigeria surpassed EU pollution limit for gasoline by over 43 times.
The SDN found out the fuel imported by Nigeria can’t even be sold to countries with higher environmental standards and of lower grade than illegally refined crude in the Niger delta.
Nigeria is ranked Number 4 globally in deaths related to air pollution, about 114,000 Nigerians die every year from respiratory diseases due to air pollution.
Nigerian cities like Port Harcourt have been dealing with a black soot problem for the past couple of years now due to Gas- Flaring and illegal oil refining issues in nearby communities.
The illegal refineries now produce up to 20% of fuel consumed in Nigeria, according to the report.
The report outline that with the outbreak of the COVID-19 which attacks the respiratory organs, the high levels of pollution pose a threat to the health of Nigerians especially in the Niger delta regions and other heavily polluted areas.

In 2017, Nigeria and her West African neighbours like Ghana, Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast promise to stop imports of low grade European refined fuel. However, only Ghana has acted on its promise as Nigeria claims it needs more time to comply.
The report urges Nigeria to enforce the sulphur demands and engage with local refiners working with Nigeria’s high grade of crude to reduce pollution.
Shell estimated its oil sales volumes in Q2 2020 to be between 3.5 million to 4.5 million barrels per day.
