The second quarter offered some great trading opportunities across all asset classes. As we head into the new quarter, I think market volatility will decline, yet I still think it will be a great quarter to trade.
My rationale is that traders in stocks and FX, overreacted on the way down, and now look to overact on the way up. The best example of this is EURUSD and AUDUSD, where we saw massive losses followed by almost complete retracements.
In stock markets, the Nasdaq 100 managed the same feat, while both the Dow Jones and S&P500 still has room to go. I think the same is true for crude oil prices.
