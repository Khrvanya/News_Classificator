Continental Resources’ Harold Hamm is buying more company stock.
Hamm is acquiring an additional 4.7 million Continental shares, the company announced this week. Hamm, Continental Resources’ founder and executive chairman, held about 289.7 million shares after those acquisitions.
Officials stated that after his latest buys, Hamm owns about 79.3% of the company’s total common shares that were on the market, as of April 30.
After markets closed Tuesday, a share of Continental Resources' stock, traded on Nasdaq under the ticker "CLR," was worth $17.53 a share, up $1.34 for the day.
The value of Hamm's shares was more than $5 billion.
"I firmly believe Continental's current share price reflects an uncommon value as the global pandemic has negatively impacted worldwide crude oil demand,” Hamm stated as part of the company’s release. “Recent purchases underscore my confidence in the company's continued operational excellence and strong financial performance.”
As for his intentions, those are set out by a “Rule 10b5-1 plan,” a measure required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Harvard Law states a Rule 10b5-1 plan is a passive investment arrangement where a participant relinquishes direct control over transactions.
Such plans provide a way for companies and corporate executives with material information about a company to execute those activities without attracting accusations of insider trading.
The release said Hamm intends to continue to acquire shares of the company's common stock consistent with certain timing, volume and price limitations.
He entered into the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan on June 25, officials said.
“Continental is poised to deliver significant shareholder value for many years to come,” Hamm stated in the release. “I believe there is no management team more aligned with shareholders than Continental."
