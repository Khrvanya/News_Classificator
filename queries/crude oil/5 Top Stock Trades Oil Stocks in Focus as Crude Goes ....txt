Home / Stock Picks / Stock Market Today / 5 Top Stock Trades: Oil Stocks in Focus as Crude Goes Negative
By Bret Kenwell , InvestorPlace Contributor Apr 20, 2020, 5:13 pm EDT
With May crude oil futures tumbling into negative territory, energy is the talk of the day on Wall Street. With that in mind, let’s look at a few energy-focused top stock trades.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Energy Sector ETF (XLE)
The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA: XLE ) is actually handling the bizarre price action in the front-month futures contract pretty well. Of course it ended the day slightly down, but that should come as little surprise.
Unfortunately, though, the stock did break below uptrend support (blue line) last week. Although it found its footing just above $30 and the 20-day moving average, it’s now having trouble reclaiming this prior trend line.
From here, we are getting a semi-clear roadmap on how to navigate the XLE ETF. If it can reclaim $34, it puts $36 resistance in play, as well as the declining 50-day moving average. Above that and a rally over $40 is certainly possible.
A move below $30 and the 20-day moving average would be a bearish development. That would put the $26 to $27.50 area in play on the downside, and potentially lower if oil prices continue to drag down the sector.
