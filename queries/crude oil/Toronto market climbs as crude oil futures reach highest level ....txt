	Canada's main stock index recovered at the end of Monday trading with the energy sector rising as crude oil futures reached their highest closing in two weeks.
With a vacuum of major data or news, investors had been moved for much of the day by a series of negative events. This included the possible renewal of a trade dispute between the U.S. and China over the COVID-19 pandemic, billionaire investor Warren Buffett's sale of his entire airline stake and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's comments that he wasn't sure international travel would resume this year.
They were all contributing factors to the day's pessimism, said Anish Chopra, managing director with Portfolio Management Corp.
"It's certainly not positive for the markets, those kind of comments," he said in an interview.
"But there's lots of different things that could change when you look at it. There's U.S. states that are starting to reopen, so it'll be interesting to see how that goes over the next days and weeks."
Chopra said the reopenings in various parts of the U.S. will give investors a real feel for what's happening on the ground in regional economies.
He said Buffett's negative comments about the economy and airlines during the weekend annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway pushed the airline sector lower.
Buffett had long been critical of investing in airlines but bought 10 per cent stakes in several U.S. carriers after the sector was restructured.
His message was that airline investors must be prepared financially and psychologically for a long wait in case the worst-case scenarios happen.
