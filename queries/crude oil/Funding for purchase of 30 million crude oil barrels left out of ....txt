WASHINGTON - A planned purchase of 30 million barrels of crude for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve does not appear to be funded under the $2 trillion stimulus package agreed to by Republicans and Democrats Wednesday.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a letter to senators Wednesday Democrats had eliminated from the legislation a, “$3 billion bailout for big oil.”
Last week Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said he talking to Congress about getting $3 billion in funding to buy crude from small and medium-sized U.S. producers, with hope of starting to fill the reserve within weeks.
Without funding, the timeline of President Donald Trump’s plan to fill the reserve, offering a small lifeline to oil and gas producers in Texas and beyond, is unclear.
The trade group American Exploration and Production Council said it was “confident” the purchases would go ahead.
“We are confident that DOE will be able to meet the President’s directive to purchase up to $3 billion in US-produced crude for the [petroleum reserve] and appreciate the administration’s commitment to both diplomatic and free-market solutions to the supply and demand crisis our industry is facing,” said Anne Bradbury, CEO of the trade group.
The impact of the filling up of the petroleum reserve is not expected to have much impact on crude prices.
Brouillette described the move as one designed to buy up oil cheap, in the event of future emergencies requiring a release of crude onto the market.
“It’s a very common sense approach and a strong signal to an important industry that underpins our national economy,” he said. “I don’t anticipate this is going to drive oil prices up.”
