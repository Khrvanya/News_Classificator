Smoke from a fire at the Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq, Saudi Arabia.
Shares of energy companies shot up Monday in the wake of the aerial attack on Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil facility. That led to the suspension of about 5% of world oil production, the largest supply disruption ever.
Phil Flynn, a senior market strategist with the Price Futures group who writes a daily energy report , said that even though the oil-supply disruption from the weekend attack was larger than those suffered during the Gulf War in 1991 or Iran’s revolution in 1979, this cut is “a little less ominous” because the size of the oil market is so much larger today.
