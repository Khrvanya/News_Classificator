Gold, XAU/USD, Crude Oil, Canada GDP - Talking Points:
Anti-fiat gold prices spent the previous 24 hours in range-bound trade which was also seen in the US Dollar and in longer-dated Treasury yields. The latter two are key fundamental drivers for XAU/ USD . Financial markets spent Monday recovering from the risk aversion tone left behind at the end of last week. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones closed +1.47% and +2.32% respectively.
The improvement in risk appetite supported growth-oriented crude oil prices as WTI experienced its best day in over 3 weeks (+3.8%). A combination of rosy US home sales and Boeing being given the greenlight to begin testing its troubled 737 MAX plane likely improved market mood . This is as US coronavirus cases only climbed 1.2% over the past 24 hours, lower than the previous week’s 1.6% average.
Crude oil prices may continue climbing as S&P 500 futures point higher following better-than-expected Chinese manufacturing PMI data . The latter may have supported global growth recovery bets, which could be underscored by upcoming Canadian GDP data. For gold prices, the near-term trajectory is more uncertain . Rising optimism in financial markets may boost government bond yields at the expense of USD.
Gold prices have left behind a Doji candlestick on the daily chart. This is a sign of indecision which could precede a turn lower given a close lower ahead. That would place the focus on near term rising support from the beginning of June – red line. Otherwise, further gains may see the precious metal continue on its cautious journey towards the 2012 high at 1795.
