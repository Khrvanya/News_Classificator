We know the meaning of this compound word before the fluctuations of petroleum products. Peter means rock oleum oil. The first reason to address rock oil was (Dr Natura Fossilium). The author of this article is a German mineralogist.  It was George Beaver who published this creative work in 1546, naming it Agri-Cola. In modern times, it is also known as crude oil. A mixture of hydrogen and carbon in naturally occurring molecules.  Other organic compounds (nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) include natural metals (iron, nickel, copper and vanadium).The composition and quantity are as follows: Carbon contains 83 to 87 per cent, hydrogen 10 to 14 per cent, nitrogen 0.1 to 3 per cent, oxygen 0.1 to 1.5 per cent, sulfur 0.5 to 6 per cent and metals less than 1000 ppm.
Crude oil contains four types of hydrocarbons (alkynes and cycloalcins). Paraffin averages 30 per cent while its content is 15 to 65 per cent, nephrons averages 49 per cent and 30 to 60 per cent, aromatics averages 15 per cent and 3 per cent.  30%, asphaltics average 6% while the rest consists of the same.  In this energy race, the United States managed to run the fastest, capturing Iraq’s purchase of 500 metric tons of uranium from Canada in the blink of an eye. This uranium proved to be a golden hen for the United States.  Eggs were supplied to India by the United States with multiple interest rates.
South Asian countries were thrown into a new marathon race, which ignited the Great War in many countries. Russia and the United States have torn these countries apart for three decades. In the field of strong dollars and investment, the Allies have tested a new weapon that seemed to be a relatively loss-making deal but a double-edged sword. And the most mineral-rich land in the eyes of the United States was shining brightly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In order to gain ground power, the United States had a golden opportunity to hollow out the Soviet Union internally.  Professor Richard Heinberg of California, Santa Rosa, has created a CIA report that the United States has played with oil prices to subdue the Russian economy.
One author predicted that in the future, Russia would become a buyer of oil from OPEC, not a seller-policy.  Implementation would leave Russia trapped in the international economic system. In the 1980s, the United States pushed Saudi Arabia into a war in which every effort was made to make oil production available on the cheap market. The United States was completely successful. During this period, the United States considered weapons as the source of all its efforts. Russia wanted to compete in this race by selling oil at exorbitant prices, but was unsuccessful and lost. The United States took Saudi Arabia into the alliance because it owned the largest oil reserves in the world.  OPEC countries (1189.80 billion barrels) have 79.4% reserve’s and non-OPEC countries (308.18 billion barrels) have reserves of 20.6%.
At the end of 2018, Saudi Arabia owned 22.4 percent of them.  Venezuela tops the list with 25.5 (bb) percent. Overall, OPEC countries added 186.2 billion barrels of proven oil to the market from 2009 to 2018, while non-OPEC countries accounted for only 24.6 billion barrels.  Non-OPEC countries’ reserves in production stood at 152.1 billion barrels. On the other hand, OPEC could only touch the graph of 113.8 billion barrels. At the end of 2018, OPEC released the names of the largest exporters of crude oil in its annual report.  Venezuela (302.81 BB) first, Saudi Arabia (267.03 BB) second, Iran (155.60 BB), Iraq (145.02 BB), Kuwait (101.50 BB), UAC (97.80 BB), Libya (48.36) BB), Nigeria (36.9) 7 BB), Algeria (12.20 BB), Ecuador (8.27 BB), Angola (8.16 BB), Congo (2.98 BB), Gabon (2.00 BB) and finally Equatorial Guinea(1.10 BB).  In 2018, the world demanded 98.72 million barrels of oil per day.Non-OECD oil consumption has been higher in terms of cost.
A year is divided into four parts. In 2017, the United States spent the most oil in the world in 2Q and 4Q, but in 2018 its spending rate is 1Q, 3Q and 4Q. The United States ranks first in terms of oil consumption at 19687287 barrels per day, which is 934.3 gallons per capita per year.  Singapore (3679.5 gallons per capita) consumes the most oil per gallon, followed by Saudi Arabia (1560.2 gallons per capita) annually. US oil production is 14.83 billions barrels per year. Saudi Arabia second with 12.4 billion barrels per year, Russia third with 11.26 billion barrels per annum, China fourth with 4.99 billion barrels per year, Canada 4.59 billion barrels per year.  Iraq ranks fifth with 6.44 billion barrels a year.
In 2016, the world’s proven oil reserves were 1.65 trillion barrels and oil consumption was 35.44 billion barrels per year and 97.1 million barrels per day.  According to this calculation, oil reserves will be available for 47 years. The population of 2016 was based on 7 billion 464 million 22 thousand 49 people. Global oil consumption is 5 barrels (199 gallons) per person per year was. But today, on May 7, 2020, the world’s population is 7 billion 78 hundred million 28 million 4 thousand 8 hundred 41 and oil reserves are 15 trillion 9 billion 57 hundred million 16 million 29 thousand 3 hundred 2 barrels.  The person will come. We will be able to use the remaining amount of oil for 47 years, 237 days, 9 hours and 36 minutes. The rapid depletion of oil reserves speaks volumes about human difficulties in the future.  Oil is considered to be the biggest source of human needs in the world. From human transportation to the fertility of the land, the need for oil has made man needy. Expectations of hot wars, not cold wars in the future. There will be a reduction in the need to grow more than food.
