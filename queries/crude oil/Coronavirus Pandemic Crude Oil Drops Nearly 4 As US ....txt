Brent crude was trading down $1.03, or 2.9 per cent, at $$34.76 by around 0130 GMT (7 am in India) having switched in and out of positive territory before the US announcement. The contract fell nearly 4 per cent on Thursday.
US crude was down $1.13, or 3.4 per cent, at $31.85 after dropping 4 per cent in the previous session.
The United Arab Emirates followed Saudi Arabia in announcing plans to boost oil output after the collapse last week of an agreement between OPEC, Russia and other producers, a grouping known as OPEC+, to withhold supply and buttress prices.
UAE's national oil company, ADNOC, said it plans to raise crude sales to more than 4 million barrels per day (bpd) and accelerate a push to boost capacity by a quarter to 5 million bpd.
