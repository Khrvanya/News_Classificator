In addition to production cuts, low prices, and help from OPEC have put the market closer to balance. Even the talk of a return of Libyan oil should not stop the normalization of the global oil market. Compliance is critical and Russia and Saudi Arabia continue to press OPEC laggards into full compliance. It seems to be working as we see better agreement from Iraq and Nigeria.
According to reports from tanker tracking company Petro Logistics, Reuters reports OPEC has cut oil output in June by 1.25 million BPD from May levels as it works to implement a supply restraint agreement with Russia and other allies. OPEC and its allies agreed to cut supply by a record 9.7 million BPD from May 1 to offset an oil price and demand slump triggered by the coronavirus crisis. OPEC's share of the cut is 6.084 million BPD.
In an email, Petro-Logistics said, "Excluding Iran, Libya, and Venezuela, which are not part of the curtailment agreement, OPEC supply remains about 1.55 million BPD away from full compliance. Iraq, Nigeria and Kuwait are the main countries that have lowered their supply since May, with more limited cuts by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Angola.”
The pressure continues. Reports say that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a phone call with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, discussed the OPEC+ pact and issues relating to compliance. Yet Covid-19 worries remain.
