Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge has announced that it will use an abandoned portion of its Canadian Mainline pipeline to store crude oil temporarily, Kallanish Energy reports
The company said the section of Line 3 pipeline in Saskatchewan and Manitoba could store up to 900,000 barrels of oil, starting June 1.
The plan must be approved by the Canada Energy Regulator.
The pipeline could hold as much crude oil as four standard-sized tanks for up to eight months, the company said.
The section of pipeline is between Regina, Saskatchewan, and Cromer, Manitoba.
That section of pipeline has been replaced with a new Line 3 and is scheduled to be decommissioned next year.
Enbridge completed tests to assure that the pipeline met all safety requirements to be used for storage. Additional testing is planned.
With the pipeline and other storage improvements, the company said it expects to create a total of 2 million barrels of additional storage capacity in 2020.
Lack of storage has become a major issue for O&G producers in North American and around the world as production continues with low commodity prices and low demand for crude from refiners.
Enbridge is still working on Line 3 permitting in Minnesota.
The new Line 3 will be 1,031 miles in length in three states and Canada when completed.
At present, Line 3 runs from Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wis. The Canadian portion that has been completed runs from Hardisty to Gretna, Manitoba, and the not-yet-completed U.S. portion runs from Neche, N.D., to Superior, Wis.
The pipeline, now 34 inches in diameter, will be replaced with a 36-inch-in-diameter line.
It is a key part of Enbridgeâ€™s Mainline System for transporting tar sands crude oil to refineries and markets in the United States and eastern Canada.
It is designed to carry light, medium and heavy crudes and light synthetics. The capacity would nearly double to about 760,000 barrels per day.
