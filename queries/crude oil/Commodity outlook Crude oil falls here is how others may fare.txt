NEW DELHI: Barring CPO, all bullion, metal and energy counters traded with losses on MCX in Monday’s trade as rising virus infections across the world spooked traders.
Gold slipped about 0.30 per cent and silver 0.62 per cent while crude oil dropped 2.45 per cent and its peer natural gas 0.30 per cent. The base metal trio of zinc , lead and copper fell up to a per cent.
“Gold’s safe haven demand remains on the higher side due to fears of a second wave of coronavirus spread in China and a weaker US dollar. Meanwhile, hopes of recuperating global economic sentiments as many countries eased lockdown restrictions likely to limit major gains in the commodity,” said Hareesh V, Head Commodity Research at Geojit Financial Services.
NCDEX Agridex, an agricultural futures Index which tracks the performance of the ten liquid commodities, was down 0.01 per cent at 1,038.85 as losses in refined soya oil, coriander , jeera and cottonseed outlook nullified the gains in other constituent commodities.
