Energy stocks in broad rally, led by Apache after oil prices surge for a second day
Energy stocks enjoyed a broad rally Thursday morning, enough to pace the S&P 500's 11 sectors in gains, as crude oil prices soared for a second day after the historic drubbing earlier this week. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE,
shot up 28.2% after running up 19.1% on Wednesday, but has still only retraced 34% of the 47.8% plunge over Monday and Tuesday. The energy ETF has now gained 46.8% over the past month, making it the best performer among SPDR ETFs tracking the S&P 500's 11 sectors. Crude oil futures have shed 24.3% the past month and the S&P 500 has gained 26.5%.
Breaking even is looking possible for the second quarter, according to a leaked email from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Thatâ€™s fueling a mini-rally in Tesla stock.
