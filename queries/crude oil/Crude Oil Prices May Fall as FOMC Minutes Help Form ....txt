CRUDE OIL & GOLD TALKING POINTS:
Gold prices advance to an 8-year high, inching closer to $1800/oz mark
Crude oil prices rose amid a broad-based upswell in risk appetite, with the WTI benchmark rising alongside US stocks. Gold prices also gained as the chipper mood undermined haven demand for the US Dollar , boosting the appeal of anti-fiat alternatives epitomized by the yellow metal.
A clear-cut catalyst for the risk-on tilt is not readily apparent. The move began before unexpectedly strong US consumer confidence data or a series of cautiously encouraging comments from policy officials including Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin crossed the wires. Perhaps it owed to month- and quarter-end capital flows.
Looking ahead, the spotlight turns to minutes from June’s FOMC meeting. The outcome of that conclave produced the sharp bout of anti-risk liquidation that the pace-setting S&P 500 stock is yet to recover from. Comments suggesting the Fed has shifted into wait-and-see mode – limiting scope for near-term stimulus expansion – may sour sentiment and push commodity prices broadly lower.
