The oil production deal calls for Brazil, Canada, and the U.S. to cut back by a total of 3.7 million barrels a day, in addition to the 9.7 million barrels a day reduction from the OPEC+ countries. The deal appears to be a victory for Mexico, which had derailed a previous tentative agreement through its desire for smaller cuts, and the U.S., which has worked to shore up its faltering domestic oil industry that generates lower profits and in many cases, loses, as oil prices drift lower.
Mexico will cut production by 100,000 barrels a day, which is less as a percentage of its production than other nations. OPEC previously asked Mexico to reduce output by 350,000 barrels a day. Oil prices have hit nearly 20-year lows as estimates for plunging economic output have slashed demand.
Oil prices dipped after the worldâ€™s biggest oil producing countries reached a deal on the biggest production cut in history.
