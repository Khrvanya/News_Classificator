Crude Oil Price Outlook: WTI Edges Above Recent High, Will it Break Out?
Risk-sensitive assets have been on the road to recovery following the aftermath of the June 10 Fed meeting, with crude being one of the assets that has returned to surpass recent highs. As a result, the commodity has moved within reach of a few important technical barriers that may give pause to an attempted continuation. Either way, the fate of crude likely rests in the hands of broader risk appetite, which has recently been susceptible to quick pullbacks as investors juggle covid concerns with economic stimulus.
With that in mind, crudeâ€™s price outlook is heavily tied to economic activity projections as an indicator of demand. Thus, any indication that a second coronavirus wave might spur a secondary lockdown period could also seriously undermine crude prices with little notice. As it stands, however, recent manufacturing PMI data has offered an encouraging tailwind regarding economic production, so immediate concerns may be soothed in that arena but the risk will remain.
Therefore, it seems crude is at the mercy of market sentiment in the days ahead. If bullish appetite persists, possible resistance around the $41.11 mark might act as an early barrier which is closely followed by the 200-day simple moving average around $43.50. Together, the technical levels should look to fight off bullish intentions, but the recent higher-high is an encouraging technical sign to be sure.
