KUALA LUMPUR (March 30): The FBM KLCI closed 14.21 points or 1.06% lower today at 1,328.88 as crude oil prices slumped amid jitters from the Covid-19 pandemic’s global economic impact as countries restrict movement to curb the outbreak.
At 5pm, the KLCI closed at 1,328.88 after falling to its intraday low of 1,317.39, as crude oil prices slumped below U$20 a barrel. Crude oil prices fell on expectation the Covid-19 outbreak will erode demand at a time when the Saudi Arabia-Russia price war leads to anticipation of higher supply of the commodity in world markets.
“The key issue for investors at this moment at this time is how long the pause in economic activity as a result of the virus will continue, and how much of an economic impact will be present.
