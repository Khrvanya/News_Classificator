Comex gold gained more than 1 percent to trade above $ 1,770/oz after a 1.2 percent gain in the previous session. Gold has been trading in a broad range of $1,680-1,750 for the last few weeks, however, a break and close above $ 1,750 led to extended gains.
Gold has benefitted from safe-haven buying amid increasing concerns that rising virus cases worldwide may force nations to re-impose sanctions, hurting economic activity. Also weighing on market sentiment is the US-China trade dispute. A report by Bloomberg on June 19 said China plans to accelerate purchases of American farm goods to comply with the phase one trade deal signed in January.
Reuters reported that President Donald Trump held off Xinjiang sanctions due to trade talks. Market concerns however rose as China suspended poultry imports from Tyson Foods after coronavirus cases at Arkansas plant, Bloomberg said.
