The S&P 500 index gained more than 20% in Q2 2020, printing the largest gain since the final quarter of 1998. Emerged and emerging market stock prices overall also gained about 17% in the second quarter, according to MSCI’s All-Country World index.
“Stimulus measures announced by central banks around the world, including a series of interventions by the US Federal Reserve to soothe unsteady markets, helped to lift stocks in April,” Max Kettner, strategist at HSBC told FT. Rising hopes for a rapid recovery in major economies helped to keep the momentum going later in the quarter.
“Equities rebounded significantly in the second quarter with more than three-quarters of the losses in Q1 2020 already recovered,” Max Kettner added.
“The resurgence in the virus is not a surprise,” said Ethan Harris, an economist at Bank of America. “However, downside risks are growing.”
