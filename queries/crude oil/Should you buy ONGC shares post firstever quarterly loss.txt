Brokerages maintained their bullish view on ONGC even as the firm posted its first-ever quarterly loss after it took an impairment on falling crude oil prices.
The oil and gas producer posted a Rs 3,098 crore loss in the January-March quarter as compared to a profit of Rs 4,240 crore in the same period a year back.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services and Edelweiss Securities maintained ‘Buy’ call on ONGC with a target price of Rs 105 and Rs 100 (Rs 103 earlier), respectively.
The scrip traded 2.33 per cent down at Rs 79.50 at around 11.15 am (IST), while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 0.52 per cent at 35,096 at around the same time.
“ONGC is also expected to grow its gas production by around 12 per cent and 26 per cent to 27.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) and 35.2 bcm in FY21 and FY22E, respectively. While no oil production growth is expected, ONGC’s efforts to arrest decline from age-old fields (accounting for 60–70 per cent of the total oil production) is commendable,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a report.
Revenue in the fourth quarter declined to Rs 21,456 crore from Rs 26,759 crore a year back. Crude oil production was marginally lower at 5.82 million tonnes in January-March as compared to 5.9 million tonnes in the previous year.
Natural gas output slipped to 6.04 billion cubic meters from 6.56 bcm in January-March 2019 after demand fell due to the Covid-19 lockdown.
According to Edelweiss, ONGC missed estimates by 63 per cent primarily due to a one-time impairment loss worth Rs 4,890 crore towards crude oil or gas inventory. Impairment is now a global phenomenon with majors Shell and BP Plc too planning to take hit thereof.
“Realisations stood broadly in line. We expect ONGC’s Rs 80,000 crore worth of projects under implementation to revive gas production from FY20-23E with an EBITDA CAGR of 13 per cent. However, we remain cautious on FY21 demand outlook bearing in mind the Covid-19 crisis and the Saudi-Russia uncertainty on crude production cuts,” Edelweiss added
