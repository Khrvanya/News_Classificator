ConocoPhillips to ramp up U.S. oil production in July
Houston oil major ConocoPhillips plans to ramp up its U.S. oil production in July after oil prices appear to have stabilized near $40 a barrel.
ConocoPhillips plans to ramp up its oil production in the U.S. this month after crude prices appear to have stabilized near $40 a barrel.
The Houston company, which in May and June shut down a third of its production, said it will begin reopening wells that were temporarily closed in the U.S. and Canada. The move comes after CEO Ryan Lance said in an interview published last month by industry research firm IHS Markit that the company is thinking of slowly returning to the market because of rising crude prices. Oil was trading Wednesday morning at $39.67, up 1 percent from a day earlier.
ConocoPhillips joins several energy companies looking to restart wells and increase production as coronavirus-related restrictions ease around the globe. Concho Energy and Parsley Energy are reopening existing wells while EOG resources said it plans to increase production capacity in the third quarter.
During the second quarter, ConocoPhillipsÂ slowed productionon by about 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. About 65 percent of the curtailments took place in the Lower 48 states, 15 percent in Alaska, another 15 percent in Canada and the remainder in Malaysia.
The company expects to report second-quarter production of 960 million to 980 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 5 percent less than during the first quarter.
