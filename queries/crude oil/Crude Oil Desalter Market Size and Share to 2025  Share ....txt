Crude oil is take out from offshore which includes many harmful impurities includes polymer, drilling mud, water, salts and sand. To remove moisture and salts from crude oil, crude oil desalter is used. For removing water content from crude oil the method is used called as crude oil electrostatic dehydrator. If crude oil is not treated then the impurities, water and salt present in crude oil will causes many maintenance and operating problems includes abrasion, fouling of equipment, corrosion and poisoning of catalysts in processing division. Crude oil desalter and crude oil electrostatic dehydrator is very effective methods to reduce water and salt content from crude oil. It includes different components such as level control device, mud wash, transactors, electrodes, distribution system and process vessel.
Sort and innovation of desalters utilized altogether influence the desalting execution and proficiency. Furthermore, different others elements, for example, raw petroleum sustain rate, raw petroleum quality, electrical field power, control of water level, temperature/consistency/thickness connections, wash water rate, emulsion arrangement, sort of pumps, stream design, kind of valves, sort of blenders, control of emulsion layers, emulsifier innovation, and saline solution reuse rate likewise influence desalting execution. Desalters are additionally utilized as a part of liquid reactant breaking (FCC) units, which change over substantial hydrocarbon bits of petroleum unrefined oils to more esteemed items, for example, fuel and olefin gasses to alter the dissimilarity between the business sector request and generation supply of esteemed refined petroleum items.
