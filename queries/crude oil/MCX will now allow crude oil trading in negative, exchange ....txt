Gold prices hit all-time high today, rally 27% from March lows; time to buy or sell yellow metal?
Effective trading in negative prices for crude oil could still take some months. After suffering huge losses in April, when the prices dropped below zero, brokerage firms have now increased margins for trading in crude oil or have stopped trading. The closing of crude oil futures in the negative has also forced certain members of the exchange to seek the legal route. Crude oil contracts on MCX mirror the prices on NYMEX, however keeping in mind the trimmed market hours during the nation-wide lockdown closed ahead of time, making it difficult for clients to exit their positions when the prices slipped into negative on the NYMEX.
The sharp drop in the price of WTI Crude Oil futures was aided by the slumping demand owing to the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the world to a virtual shut down. WTI Crude oil has now surged from its April lows and was trading at $33.57 per barrel, however, it is still trading at half its price in January this year. Brent Crude was trading at $35.27 per barrel.
