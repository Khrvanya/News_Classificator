Oil prices gained on Tuesday morning, with investors waiting to see if major oil producers agree to extend their massive output cuts to support crude oil prices, at a virtual meeting expected to hold this week.
Brent crude futures gained 1.10%, to trade at $38.73 per barrel as at Tuesday morning. The price has doubled over the last six weeks, thanks to oil production cuts by a group comprising of the Russians, Western oil producers, and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
“The whole story is very much based around the supply cuts and the demand recovery,” Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst, Vivek Dhar, told Reuters.
The rally in crude oil price in recent weeks has been triggered by growing economic demand since the deadly virus COVID-19 wrecked financial systems. Nigerians will see this as positive news based on the fact that crude oil makes about 90% of Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings and more than two-thirds of government revenue.
This has shown lately as Nigeria’s reserve surged pass $36.12 billion after plummeting to around $33 billion a few months ago.
“Most likely, OPEC+ could extend current cuts until Sept. 1, with a meeting set before then to decide on next steps,” said Citi’s head of commodities research Edward Morse.
Under the OPEC+ plan agreed in April, the record supply cut was to be for May and June, reducing oil production to 7.7 million barrels per day from July through December. Saudi Arabia has been leading talks to push for extending the heftier cuts, sources told Reuters last week.
“Russia will be the key obstacle in any extension, and they are unlikely to agree on any extension which goes beyond a couple of months,” said analysts at Dutch bank ING.
“An extension could push oil prices to $40, but there would have to be a follow-through on that commitment to sustain higher prices,” said Commonwealth Bank’s Dhar.

The NPA said it does have an account with Unity Bank Plc, but has not operated it since 2010.
The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has denied the allegations of a whistleblower who claimed that the authority has a hidden $1 billion account with Unity Bank Plc.
The NPA, in a statement responding to a petition by a man named John Okpurhe to President Muhammadu Buhari, said the allegations that it operates such accounts are untrue.
The petitioner had also accused the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Salami (SAN) of allegedly refusing to reward him after allegedly exposing over $1 billion in a hidden account with Unity Bank Plc operated by the NPA.
The petitioner also claimed that an account number 0013680344 operated by the NPA with Unity Bank contains the hidden amount. However, the NPA vehemently denied the allegations and claimed that it only operates the bank account 0013670344 which had a total sum of $1,057,772.03 as of December 2019 and not the $1,034,515,000.00 as alleged by the petitioner.
The NPA also says the account has not been in operations since August 2010 due to a Garnishee Order placed on it in the Aminu Ibrahim & Co $ Anor vs Nigerian Ports Authority case, which went from Federal High Court to the Supreme Court in 8 years. Parts of the detailed statement released by the NPA said:
“The Judgment creditors continued with the Garnishee process which resulted in the credit of the amount $1,057,772.03 in favour of Suit No: FHC/L/CS/582/2010 GARNISHEE ORDER NISI – AMINU IBTAHIM & CO & ANOR vs  NIGERIAN PORTS AUTHORITY on December 4rg 2019 in line with the Garnishee order absolute.

“The account under discussion was frozen on the strength of a court order in August 2010, following the completion of the case, the money was consequently transferred to the judgment creditor on December 4, 2019 in line with the Garnishee Order Absolute.”
