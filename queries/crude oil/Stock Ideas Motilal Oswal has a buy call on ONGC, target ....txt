Motilal Oswal has given a buy rating to Oil And Natural Gas Corporation with a target price of Rs 105. The share price moved down by -1.17 per cent from its previous close of Rs 81.35. The stock’s last traded price is Rs 80.40.
ONGC’s 4QFY20 oil and gas sales were 3 per cent/8 per cent higher than brokerage estimate while net realisation was 3 per cent lower than estimate. This resulted in marginal beat on revenue. Higher other expenditure and Covid-19 led impairment resulted in a huge loss on the bottom line for the company during the quarter.
ONGC did not see any reduction in crude oil demand starting 1st Apr’20. However, gas production saw modest decline of 9 per cent during the lockdown, but has now been restored to normal pre-Covid levels. Global lockdowns on account of Covid-19 led to huge demand destruction, which saw crude oil prices sink to historic lows. With lifting of the lockdowns across the world, demand is again seeing an uptick.
Although gas production has been delayed, the brokerage expects it to jump significantly over the next 2-3 years. This would be led by the 13 projects that the company is working on. Oil production is expected to remain flat. As a result of the capex cuts, demand revival, and better cooperation among OPEC++ countries, Motilal Oswal expects oil prices to stabilise at $40–50/bbl over the next few months. The government is reportedly formulating a structure to give Indian upstream companies some relief in royalty and cess as well as other reliefs. According to the brokerage’s model calculation, 1 per cent change in cess results in 2 per cent consolidated EPS change for ONGC.
ONGC has not recommended any final dividend apart from the interim dividend of Rs 5/share during the year. ONGC is trading at 3.3 times FY22E EV/EBITDA and 4.3 times FY22E P/E. The company is valued at 10 times FY22E adjusted EPS of Rs 7.8 and value of investments added to arrive at a target price of Rs 105.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company reported consolidated sales of Rs 104488.95 crore, down -4.53 per cent from last quarter sales of Rs 109443.39 crore and down -6.97 per cent from last year same quarter sales of Rs 112316.40 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs -6875.29 crore in the latest quarter..
