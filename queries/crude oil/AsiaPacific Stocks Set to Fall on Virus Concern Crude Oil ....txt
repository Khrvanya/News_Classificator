Asia-Pacific Stocks Set to Fall on Virus Concern; Crude Oil Prices Tumble
The S&P 500 index registered its biggest selloff seen in two weeks, as virus cases climbed
Singapore’s Straits Times Index set to open sharply lower, testing a key support at 2,600
The futures market points to a sharp decline across Asia-Pacific equities, following a heavy selloff in the Wall Street session overnight. In the FX market, the growth-geared Australian and New Zealand Dollars as well as the oil-linked Norwegian Krone were among the worst performing in G10 currencies. This suggests clear ‘risk off’ sentiment at the open.
The S&P 500 index fell 2.58%, registering its biggest loss seen in two weeks. All sectors ended lower, with energy (-5.54%), industrials (-3.51%), financials (-3.51%) and materials (-2.59%) among the worst performing sectors (chart below).
The resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the US, EU and parts of the emerging world led to mounting concerns over the economic recovery, as a second viral wave might derail governments’ re-opening plans, or even lead to a setback. As a result, energy demand might get hurt first, which was clearly shown in sectoral performance last night. Tourism & leisure, aviation, brick & mortal retail, luxury goods, automobile are among the more vulnerable sectors amid a global pandemic.
Tonight’s US weekly jobless claims data will be closely watched by traders for clues of a potential impact on the labor market. Economists foresee a 1.3 million increase in claims, extending a 12th consecutive weekly decline (chart below).
Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets are shut for Tuen Ng Festival on Thursday. Trading in the Shanghai stock market will resume on next Monday.
