Is the NYSE Composite Forming A Bearish Double Top Pattern?
One of the broadest stock market indexes and measures of the broad market is flashing bearish caution.
To be fair, the NYSE Composite has been flashing caution for months, as the index has yet to exceed its January 2018 highs (while the S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Industrials, and others have).
In today’s chart, though, we can see that this setup has become even more bearish in recent weeks.
The May thru June rally leg pushed the NYSE Index up to its highs made last fall at (1) within a rising wedge like pattern. This important test of resistance failed, sending the NYSE lower and through wedge support at (2).
Leave this field empty if you're human:
Stock market bulls do not want to see selling accelerate on this important index. Stay tuned!
