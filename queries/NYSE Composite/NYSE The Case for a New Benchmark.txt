Over the years I have been very frustrated with the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) and the S&P 500 Index as benchmarks as they really don’t give a very accurate story, in my opinion, of what really happens in the market on a day to day basis. The NYSE Composite Index on the other hand is made up of issues from more than 1,900 companies including more than 1,500 U.S. companies and over 330 non-U.S. companies. With a total float-adjusted market cap of over $19 trillion, the Index provides an exceptional breadth of diversification and is a useful benchmark for investors who prefer to track global market performance in a single market. So with the NYSE you have companies of all market caps and from some 38 countries.
With the DJIA Index you have 30 companies, where if one or two have a good day, the whole Index becomes skewed. The S&P 500 Index is more diversified but does not include foreign stocks. My client portfolios are basically made up of U.S. Stocks, but I do have some 20% invested in ADR’s. Having a benchmark Index that is mostly made up of U.S. stocks, but also has 17.4% foreign holding represented in it serves my purposes perfectly.
I also like the NYSE Index as it is much harder to beat than the S&P 500 and the DJIA. As you can see from the chart below that over the last ten years the NYSE Index consistently outperformed both the DJIA and the S&P 500 and I feel that it is not widely used as a benchmark because the number of portfolio managers that can outperform it are few and far between.
And here is a five year chart:
As for me I will be competing exclusively against the NYSE Index as it perfectly mirrors the way most portfolio managers invest these days. If I can outperform it then I know that I will be at the top of my game.
