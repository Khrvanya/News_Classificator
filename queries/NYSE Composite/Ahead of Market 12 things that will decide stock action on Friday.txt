HDFC Life replaces Vedanta in Nifty; SBI Card enters 5 indices
NEW DELHI: Nifty extended its winning streak into a second consecutive session and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart on Thursday. Analysts said the short-term trend for the index remains positive.
Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said technically with Nifty moving up further after breaking out of the 10194-10410 range, the underlying trend remains upward.
Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said Nifty has to hold above 10,450 level to witness an up-move towards 10,650 and 10,800 levels, while on the downside immediate support is seen at 10,333 and then 10,250 levels.
Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities Nifty has scope to move up to 10,750 with a minor hurdle at 10,680. "Buying is advisable if Nifty corrects to 10,500/10,450 levels. Keep a final stop loss at 10,400 for the same. Bank Nifty is forming an interesting setup, thereby, we could see the 23,000/23,200 levels if it crosses 22,500.”
That said, here’s a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Friday’s market action:
Wall Street opened higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq hitting an all-time high as data showed the U.S. economy added jobs at a record pace in June, the latest signal of a rebound in business activity following the easing of coronavirus-led lockdowns. At 7:40 pm (IST), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 431.49 points, or 1.68 per cent, at 26,166.46, the S&P 500 was up 46.08 points, or 1.48 per cent, at 3,161.94, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 147.27 points, or 1.45 per cent, at 10,301.90.
European shares climbed on Thursday as encouraging economic data from across the globe and hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine lifted sentiment. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.2 per cent to mark its fourth consecutive day of gains. Banks, automakers and travel & leisure firms were the top gainers, jumping between 2.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent. Financial markets entered the second half of the year on a cheerful note earlier this week, as business surveys showed a coronavirus-induced slump in global manufacturing eased in June.
Nifty50 saw follow-up buying on Thursday and formed a bullish candle on the daily chart for the second session in a row. The NSE barometer made a higher high and low for the third straight session. Analysts said the sentiment remains positive, but further buying is needed to instill confidence among traders.
India VIX moved down 5.73 per cent to 26.50 level. A gradual decline in volatility, which is now at the lowest level in last four months, suggests an overall bullish stance and emergence of multiple supports at small declines. This suggests a buy-on-decline market. On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,000 followed by 9,000 level, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,000 levels. Options data suggested an immediate trading range between 10,300 and 10,800 levels.
