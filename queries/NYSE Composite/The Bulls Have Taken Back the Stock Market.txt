The S&P 500 is up nearly 40% in just the past 50 trading days, the largest such rally since 1957
The bulls are in the driver’s seat again. Stocks rose this week, with investors seizing on incrementally good economic news and ignoring the clashes in the streets, the odds of a long, drawn-out recovery and even the potential resumption of the U.S.-China trade war.
Driven by Boeing Co., the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.5% for the week through Thursday’s close. The S&P 500 gained 2.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%.
