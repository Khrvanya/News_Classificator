It’s no secret that retail investors have been stepping up their participation in the stock market lately, but the degree by which they have outperformed professional investors may be coming into greater focus.
A basket of equities that have been eagerly bought by individual investors since the depths of the coronavirus-induced selloff on March 23 has returned 61%, compared with returns of 45% for a portfolio of investments owned by mutual funds and hedge funds, according to Goldman Sachs data, including prominent analyst David Kostin.
The Wall Street pros, who have consistently lagged behind the overall market since the last crisis in 12 years ago, now may find themselves lagging behind mom-and-pop investors by a whopping 16 percentage points, according to the bank’s research.
