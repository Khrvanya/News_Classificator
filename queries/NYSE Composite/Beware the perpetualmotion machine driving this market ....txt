President Donald Trump and China just keep ramping up their trade battle, sending stocks worldwide into the woodchipper.
The tweeter-in-chief also is preparing to huddle this afternoon with GOP lawmakers over that family-unfriendly border policy that’s sparked outrage.
Regarding the back and forth with tariffs , Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio may be speaking for many investors with his take.
“We hope and expect that rational heads will prevail, and tit-for-tat escalations won’t accelerate to produce horrible wars,” he writes in his latest LinkedIn post .
But it’s another billionaire investor, focused on another hot topic, who provides our call of the day.
Howard Marks has thought about the growth of what he calls “investing without people,” and the Oaktree Capital co-chairman is offering warnings.
ETFs — those increasingly popular funds that track indexes — have provided a big boost to large-cap stocks and made them overpriced, Marks writes in his latest memo.
“Like the tech stocks in 2000, this seeming perpetual-motion machine is unlikely to work forever,” he cautions.
“It’s not clear where index funds and ETFs will find buyers for their over-weighted, highly appreciated holdings if they have to sell in a crunch. In this way, appreciation that was driven by passive buying is likely to eventually turn out to be rotational, not perpetual.”
High-yield bond ETFs also worry Marks.
“What’s the probability that in a crisis, a high-yield bond ETF will prove more liquid than the underlying bonds (which themselves are likely to become illiquid)?” he asks.
Beyond raising concerns about so-called passive funds, the storied investor offers views on quants and algos, as well as artificial intelligence. And he thinks there is still “a role for investors with alpha.”
