Will a COVID-19 cure drive AstraZeneca’s share price higher?
Will a COVID-19 cure drive AstraZeneca’s share price higher?
Not to be outdone by upstart biotech firms, pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca [AZN] recently announced it has the capacity to provide one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine, that it’s currently developing. How has this helped its share price?
The search for a vaccine to beat COVID-19 has resulted in good news for pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. On 21 May, it was announced that AstraZeneca has received $1bn in funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority. An agreement is in place for the company to supply at least 400 million doses of its vaccine, which is being developed at Oxford University — AstraZeneca says it has the capacity to produce a billion doses. A boon for AstraZeneca’s share price then?
AstraZeneca saw its share price rise 0.9% to 8,961p the day of the announcement, just short of a new all-time high close of 9,004p achieved just the week before.
Its share price is up 14.4% for the year to date (through 4 June). By comparison, GlaxoSmithKline’s [GSK] share price is down 4.9% since the start of 2020, while Pfizer’s stock [PFE] dropped 6.2%. Furthermore, AstraZeneca’s share price has outperformed both the FTSE 100 Index and NYSE Composite since the beginning of January.
While the company has seen its star rise as one of the frontrunners to release a vaccine, could the global pandemic help its share price increase even further?
In recent weeks the company — the product of a merger in the late 1990s between UK-based Zeneca Group and Swedish firm Astra AB and is listed on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges — has overtaken Unilever [ULVR] and Royal Dutch Shell [RDSA] to become the UK’s biggest company in terms of market capitalisation.
On 29 April AstraZeneca released its earnings report for Q1 2020, which beat expectations. Total revenue for the quarter was $6.4bn, up 15.7% on the year-ago quarter’s revenue of $5.5bn — analysts had predicted revenue of $5.91bn, according to CNBC. As for earnings per share, the company beat Zacks’ expectations for the quarter by $0.06 — $0.53 against $0.47 expected.
AstraZeneca’s strong performance in the first three months of fiscal 2020 is thanks mainly to its portfolio of products for major health conditions and diseases, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems and cancer. Cancer-related drugs and treatments sales amounted to $2.5bn, up 34% year-over-year. The short-term stockpiling of respiratory drugs has also been key.
As is the nature of health, though, pharmaceutical companies depend on people to be visiting doctors hospitals and seeking treatment and medication to generate the majority of revenue. AstraZeneca hasn’t been immune to the impact of COVID-19.
While it has maintained its guidance for the rest of the fiscal year, the company expects the coronavirus to have “an unfavourable impact”, albeit lasting just a few months. As it stands, it forecasts a high single-digital to low double-digit percentage increase in total revenue for the full twelve months. Meanwhile, EPS is expected to grow by a mid to high-teens percentage.
When it first warned of the impact during its Q4 2019 earnings call back in February, COVID-19 had only affected China. Since then, the pandemic has become a global situation. During the Q1 2020 earnings call, AstraZeneca CEO, Pascal Soriot (pictured), acknowledged there could be a downside to reduced hospital visits, missed operations and delays to treatment in China and across Europe and the US. Shareholders were informed they would be updated on the situation in the Q2 earnings report.
