This week’s video updates numerous long-term signals covered over the past year. The video covers facts rather than opinions or fears of what may or may not happen in the future.
Since there is no such thing as a foolproof indicator or signal in the financial markets, the recent bullish shift in up/down volume assists us with probabilities. As long as the slope of the 50-week remains positive, the odds of good things happening will be higher.
The facts covered above relate to longer-term outcomes, meaning weeks, months, and years. For this data to be used effectively, we must have realistic expectations about normal volatility within the context of a rising trend.
