President Trump had called a Tuesday briefing , but Vice President Mike Pence and economic advisor Larry Kudlow were the ones who attended. “ Trump’s a No-Show After Promising Briefing on Economic Plan ,” read a Bloomberg headline forwarded by NatAlliance Securities’ Andrew Brenner. “Equity futures down 1 pct,” he wrote.
Talk of possible fiscal stimulus, including aid for cruise lines and airlines, a payroll tax holiday , and credit relief for oil companies helped boost the markets on Tuesday, as t he Dow gained 1167 points , or 4.9%. Not all those plans were likely to pass a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
“It is hard to know if the equity market was simply due to bounce or if investors actually believed the aggressive stimulus options promised by President Trump and his officials,” writes JonesTrading’s Michael O’Rourke. “There is little doubt in our mind that Congress will enact legislation to provide virus relief, but the size and scope is highly debatable. The proposal of coronavirus aid for shale oil companies was preposterous.”
With another big drop on possible tomorrow morning, this market is starting to feel preposterous, too.
Stock futures are falling as the market continues to wait for a fiscal stimulus package to offset the hits from coronavirus and lower oil prices.
