For the past several weeks, I have been honing in on an important stock market ratio / indicator. This indicator is the ratio performance of the Consumer Staples (NYSEARCA:XLP) to the NYSE Composite Index (INDEXNYSEGIS:NYA).
I’ve covered this ratio and its importance as a stock market indicator several times before. Here’s my latest article on this ratio.
Today I am focusing on this indicator because the last time it looked like this, we saw a 20+ percent correction.
So let’s review what’s happened / is happening on the XLP/NYSE market ratio. Could this stock market correction indicator trigger again?
Ratio is not quite “there” yet on timing basis, so we might see more back and filling.
The previous indicator produced a 20 percent correction on the NYSE Composite.
The Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) is at the low end of the range. It can hang here for a while before seeing a big move… it did this in 2000.
In any event, this ratio is in (or nearing) the zone, so put it on your radar.
