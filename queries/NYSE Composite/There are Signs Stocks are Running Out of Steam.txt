It’s still a bull market, but there are signs it may be going to pasture. Mainly, participation in the summer rally show it’s the most popular stocks posting the gains and pulling indexes higher while the broad market - full of smaller and more domestic-U.S. focused stocks – is treading water.
Take for instance the relative performance of the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000, the broad small cap index. This chart shows that over the past quarter, the Russell – here represented by the lighter line for its ETF ticker, IWM – has started lagging the S&P by an unusually wide amount, compared to typical behavior. Look at the long term charts (not reproduced here) and usually the Russell is outpacing or closely aligned to the S&P. In fact, there hasn’t been a gap this wide been the Russell 2000 and the S&P in a decade, says Mark Newton, head of Newton Advisors.
The SP500 (purple line) is outpacing the broader Russell 2000 by the most in a decade. That's a ... [+] warning sign the bull market may not have legs.
What does this mean? Most likely that the businesses behind the Russell small caps, which are far more dependent on domestic U.S. economic performance than the S&P components, aren’t faring as well as they used to. Trade wars and the expected natural turn of the economic cycle probably would be the culprits in that case. And while the S&P is making new peaks, the more broad-based NYSE Composite index is still below the peak it hit in early 2018. In fact, as the weekly price chart here shows, the NYSE (the light blue price and trend lines) been in a mild downtrend for 18 months.
