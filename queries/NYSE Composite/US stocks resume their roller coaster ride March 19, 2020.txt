This is how insane the oil market is right now: US oil prices spiked by 24% on Thursday, marking a record one-day percentage gain. Yet even that massive rally wasn't enough to recover the $6.58-per-barrel that crude lost only the day before.
Still, the spike might raise hopes that the energy market could be finding a bottom after an historic collapse. Crude settled at an 18-year low on Wednesday in response to shrinking demand and surging supply.
"The whipsaw oil price action continues at an unprecedented and violent pace," said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
Analysts said there wasn't a clear catalyst for the rebound and instead pointed to oversold conditions and volatility across financial markets.
"These outsized moves in oil are becoming a regular occurrence as liquidity is very thin given the high volatility regime we are currently in," said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank.
The gains outstripped the 15% spike last September after Saudi Arabia's oil production suffered a devastating attack.
Oil stocks, which have been crushed by the oil crash, rallied sharply on Thursday.
climbed more than 15% apiece.
