LONDON: Oil majors' growing Atlantic divide has an interesting valuation quirk. American energy giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron are lagging further behind European rivals Royal Dutch Shell ,, BP and Total in embracing the pivot away from hydrocarbons. Yet investors seem keener on the transition tortoises than hares.
Shell and BP will later this year explain how they intend to cut carbon emissions by 2050. BP is now assuming a $100-a-tonne carbon price by 2030 and a long-term oil price of $55 a barrel for accounting purposes. On Tuesday Shell announced a $22 billion impairment charge based on a long-term price of $60. The Americans, in contrast, don't even disclose their price assumptions. Their emission-reduction plans are also much less ambitious.
Investors don't seem to care. Shell, BP and Total on average trade at 70% of book value, and their enterprise values are 7 times 2020 Refinitiv forecasts for EBITDA. Exxon and Chevron trade at book value and over 10 times EBITDA, respectively. Even using a more sophisticated metric, which adjusts oil-major enterprise values to strip out the contribution from refining arms and then compares it to a standardised value of their proven reserves, the Americans are more richly valued, according to Bernstein .
In one sense, this seems irrational. If oil prices languish at $40 a barrel for years and politicians and investors continue to take climate change ever more seriously, the Americans could face sharper future write-downs. Shell and BP may also successfully pivot. Discounting back the estimated cash flows the duo could generate from expanded renewables businesses up to 2050, Bernstein reckons the pair should be worth over 50% more than they are today.
Some of the valuation gap may be technical. U.S. and European majors use different accounting standards, which can affect their approach to write-downs, and Exxon has been accused of being slow to impair. The Dow Jones Composite Index trades at a small premium to the European STOXX 600, and it is also possible that American shareholders, like their government, generally lack their European counterparts' sense of climate change urgency.
Still, it might also just be a punt on degrees of uncertainty. Shell and BP may botch their reinvention, while Exxon and Chevron could temporarily cruise through a post-virus climate. Call it the ultimate in investor short-termism.
- Exxon Mobil is deceiving investors by failing to write down much of the value of XTO Energy , according to a complaint filed under the Securities and Exchange Commission 's whistle-blower programme and reported by the Wall Street Journal on June 30.
- Exxon's refusal to write down its $31 billion acquisition of XTO a decade ago is part of an "arrogant, aberrant, long-standing... posture" at the company, according to Franklin Bennett, a former senior accounting analyst in Exxon's oil and gas business.
- An Exxon spokesman told the WSJ that the company is in compliance with accounting rules and SEC regulations about disclosures to investors.
- Royal Dutch Shell on June 30 said it would write up to $22 billion off the value of its assets after lowering its oil and gas price outlook in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
- Shell reduced its expected average benchmark Brent crude oil price for 2020 to $35 a barrel, down from $60. For 2021 and 2022 it cut its forecast to $40 and $50 a barrel, respectively, also down from $60. Its long-term oil price outlook is $60 a barrel. The company also cut its long-term refining profit margin outlook by 30%.
