India’s leading company when it comes to oil and natural gas exploration, ONGC was up 4.5% on the bourses, trading at Rs 68.60 per share. Although Crude Oil prices tanked on Friday, they were still up considerably after the jump in prices on Thursday. “An output cut deal that balances the market will put a floor under oil price and would be positive for ONGC,” said analysts at ICICI Securities while recommending to hold the share with a target price of Rs 66.
“Crude oil has turned choppy after testing the lowest level since 2002 earlier this week. Weighing on crude price is API weekly report which noted a sharp 10.485 million barrels increase in US crude oil stocks highlighting well supplied US market. Also weighing on price are demand concerns as virus spread continues to remain out of control indicating that restrictions may remain in place for a long time. Crude was also pressurized by Saudi’s stance to boost exports in May due to lower domestic demand,” said analysts at Kotak Securities. According to ICICI Securities, a cut in output could provide some flooring for the falling crude oil prices as global demand plummets owing to the coronavirus pandemic.
