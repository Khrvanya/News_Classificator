MELBOURNE: U.S. crude oil futures climbed nearly 3 per cent on Tuesday in light trading as the Trump administration launched an effort to work with Saudi Arabia to stabilise oil prices.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for May delivery rose $0.67, or 2.9 per cent, to $24.03 as of 2353 GMT, adding to gains on Monday.
Brent futures for May delivery rose 52 cents, or 1.9 per cent, to $27.55 as of 0015 GMT.

The market is testing support following a more than 60 per cent slide in oil prices since the start of the year due to the impact of the coronavirus on global demand and a market share war between Saudi Arabia and Russia set to bloat oil supply from April.
"Given the market's already pricing in full production from Saudi Arabia and Russia and we've already priced in significant demand destruction, it's hard to see what would cause the next significant downdraft from here," McCarthy said.
Australian refiners Viva Energy and Caltex Australia Ltd said they expect jet fuel demand to shrink by 80 per cent to 90 per cent due to air travel grinding close to a halt and plan to take in less crude.
