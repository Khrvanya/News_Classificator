Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell to their lowest levels in 15 years, dragged down by a  feud between oil giants Saudi Arabia and Russia that threatens to flood the market with a glut of crude.
The S&P 500’s energy sector fell 20% on Monday—its largest drop on record. The sector is down 44% so far this year, exceeding the benchmark S&P 500’s 16% drop over the same period.
