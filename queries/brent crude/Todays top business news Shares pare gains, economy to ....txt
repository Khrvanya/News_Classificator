The easing of lockdown restrictions in May helped the Indian services sector crawl back, but not by much.
Reuters reports: "India's enormous services industry endured another month of devastating contraction in May as the coronavirus brought activity to a near halt, causing steep job losses and cementing fears of a deep recession, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Although the Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index crawled up to 12.6 in May from April's all-time low of 5.4 it remained a long way from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was just below 50 in March.
The last time it contracted for three consecutive months was from November 2016 following the ban of high-value currency notes, which severely hurt consumption.
The lockdown of India's 1.3 billion people, which started on March 25, has been extended in some areas until the end of June as domestic coronavirus cases reported approached 200,000 with more than 5,500 deaths recorded.
“Given the stringency of the lockdown measures imposed in India, it is no surprise to see the severity of the declines in April and May,” Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
Although slightly improved from April sub-indexes tracking domestic and foreign demand remained perilously close to zero, leading firms to reduce their workforce at the second sharpest pace since the survey began late 2005. It has only been faster in April.
The precious metal is finding it hard to rally as risk-on sentiment prevails among investors.
Reuters reports: "Gold prices dipped on Wednesday as equity markets rallied on economic optimism and hopes for further stimulus measures boosted risk-on sentiment.
Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,722.93 per ounce, as of 1252 GMT. U.S. gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,729.70.
On Tuesday, stocks in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets hit their highest levels since early March. Traders hope that the European Central Bank will deliver additional stimulus, by around 500 billion euros, when it meets on Thursday.
Central banks and governments around the world have unleashed huge quantities of stimulus to cushion their economies from the coronavirus pandemic.
Capping some losses, the dollar was down 0.2% and was trading at an over two-month low, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies. SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings, rose 0.1%to 1,129.28 tonnes on Tuesday."
Stocks aren't supposed to rise like this after a major shock; which might explain this rally might already have overtaken the one before it as the most hated in history. https://t.co/aFyEgI1EMc via @bopinion

Not just India, 21 nations faced ratings action: SBI report
India is not the only nation that has been downgraded, 21 other emerging market and developing economies have also faced some ratings action, a report by the State Bank of India said.
On Monday, ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the country’s sovereign rating from Baa2 to Baa3, which is one notch above junk grade, citing deteriorating fiscal position and stress in the financial system, apart from lack of economic reforms.
“However, India has not been alone to witness rating downgrade. So far, around 21 emerging and developing countries have registered either a rating and/ or outlook downgrade by the agency,” the SBI report said.
Indian economy to contract 10% this fiscal, says former finance secretary
A former finance secretary has taken issue with the Centre's nation-wide lockdown to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
PTI reports: "Former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg on Tuesday said the Indian economy will shrink by 10 per cent or Rs 20 lakh crore in the ongoing fiscal, the first contraction in over 40 years, due to a “faulty” COVID lockdown.
“It is certain that India’s GDP will contract after 40 years in 2020-21,” he said in a blogpost, adding that “it also appears fairly certain that this would be a very large contraction of about 10 per cent of GDP or loss of about Rs 20 lakh crore of income“.
The former finance secretary went on to say that the 2020-21 fiscal will go down in the history of India as the year when India got way-laid from its story of three decadal outstanding growth.
Pointing out that India was not in the pink of economic health in 2019-20, he said the economy grew barely by 4 per cent for the year which happens to be the lowest growth rate in last 11 years.
The former finance secretary termed India’s lockdown strategy to contain spread of coronavirus as faulty.
“The lockdown was imposed under a naive belief that India would be able to eliminate COVID-19 from the face of India in three weeks’ time.
