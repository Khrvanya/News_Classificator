KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday staged a modest rally as increase in international crude oil prices combined with a recovery in regional markets triggered stock buying at the local bourse, which pushed the KSE-100 index up by nearly 400 points.
During the day, Brent crude price rose 1.2% to $42.79 per barrel while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 0.7% to $39.82 a barrel after major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July.
Investors took cue from the rise and made fresh investment in oil stocks, which lent support to the benchmark index.
Also fuelling the rally were Asian shares that advanced to near three-month highs on hopes of a quicker global economic revival after weeks of lockdowns aimed at controlling the spread of coronavirus pandemic.
