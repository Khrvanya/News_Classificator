Both gold and oil are rising, although with US markets closed for the day it is likely to be a quiet end to the week.

This uptrend shows no sign of slowing for gold , although for now the price is drifting lower from $1780.
Further gains target $1790, and we would need to see a reversal below $1760 at least to suggest that a more near-term bearish view has emerged.
The uptrend from the mid-June low is still in place for Brent crude , although the price has yet to recover the peak from 23 June at $44.
Higher lows and higher highs over the past two weeks reinforce the bullish view, with a more bearish outlook requiring a drop below $41 and then below $40.
