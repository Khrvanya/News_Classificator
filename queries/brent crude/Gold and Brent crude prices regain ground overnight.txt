Gold and Brent crude regain ground overnight, yet will it be enough to lift sentiment after yesterdayâ€™s declines?

Gold has been tightening within a symmetrical triangle formation over the past 24 hours, with the price rising through trendline and $1724 resistance. That move has been relatively fleeting, yet it does point towards a likely continuation of the wider bullish trend. A persistent move through $1724 would solidify that bullish expectation for the day.
However, it is worthwhile noting that yesterday's declines occurred alongside a bearish move for indices. As such, we find ourselves in a curious situation where gold traders are more confident being bullish when stocks are on the rise. Should gold decline as stocks turn south, a break below the $1709 level would point towards a period of downside for gold.
Brent declines took us into the 61.8% Fibonacci support level yesterday, with the overnight session bringing some respite to those sharp losses. Unfortunately, we are back on a bearish pathway this morning, with the $29.00 lows back in view.
A break back below yesterday's low would signal a continuation of this current period of weakness, yet it is justified to expect some form of stability above the previous low of $24.75 given that we have seen a significant chunk of global production taken off the market since those lows. As such, the big question is whether we are going to resect these Fibonacci levels at $29.39 and $27.62, or else resume the wider downtrend. Should we hold up at Fibonacci support, it could be a sign that the dynamic is starting to shift somewhat as a gradual reopening of some countries helps lift sentiment. Otherwise, if we break below Fibonacci support, it could point towards further losses in anticipation of a long hard road of oversupply.
