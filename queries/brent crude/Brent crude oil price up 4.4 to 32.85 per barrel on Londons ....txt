A reported surge in oil prices follows a videoconference meeting of the OPEC+ member states on Sunday that ended with an agreement on oil production cuts.

Russia and Saudi Arabia will cut their daily oil output by 2.5 million barrels each from the level of 11 million barrels. Other nations will decrease production by 23% on the October 2018 level.
Mexico, which refused to accept a quota of 400,000 barrels a day, will cut production by 100,000 barrels. The remaining 300,000 barrels will be compensated by the United States, which has committed to cut daily production by 250,000 barrels a day.
The deal is a subject to revision in December 2021.
