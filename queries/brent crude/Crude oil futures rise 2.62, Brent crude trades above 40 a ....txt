Crude oil futures rose to Rs 2,856 per barrel on June 16 as participants unwound their long positions. Prices were up on recovery in the global equity markets and stimulus measures by the US Federal Reserve to boost economic growth.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told PTI that India's fuel demand has reached 80-85 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels in the first half of June, but return to the 5 percent growth trajectory may take up to two years. Demand, which had fallen by as much as 70 percent, has since recovered after lockdown restrictions were eased beginning early May.
Tapan Patel, Senior Analyst (Commodities), HDFC Securities, said crude oil prices gained on June 16 on hopes of a demand recovery and reduction in the supply glut. "Investors side-lined the worries over rising virus cases in the US, Beijing and Tokyo over prospects of higher demand. Prices were supported by a rebound in equity indices after the US Fed announced it will expand its bond buying programme to boost liquidity."
