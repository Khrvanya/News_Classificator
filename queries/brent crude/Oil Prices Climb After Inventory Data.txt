Prices are near highest level since early March, buoyed by recovering fuel demand and supply cuts by OPEC, allies
Oil prices rose Wednesday, continuing a recent rebound after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than anticipated last week.
U.S. crude futures for August delivery added 1.4% to $39.82 a barrel. Prices are near their highest level since early March, buoyed by recovering fuel demand and supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia.
