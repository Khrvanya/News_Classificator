Oil futures on Tuesday settled sharply higher as worries about the global economy receded momentarily on the eve of Christmas. However, trading volumes were light due to the holiday.
U.S. crude-oil futures finished an hour earlier than usual at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and major markets will mostly be closed on Wednesday for Christmas .

West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery US:CLF20, the U.S. benchmark grade, gained 59 cents, or 1%, to trade at $61.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after picking up 0.1% Monday.

Markets have been bolstered by a pact by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, which agreed to officially cut production by 500,000 barrels a day on top of its current reduction agreement, beginning in January. Those additional reductions were meant to take total output cuts for OPEC+ to 1.7 million barrels day, including the current cuts of 1.2 million barrels a day from October 2018 levels that was put into place in January 2019.
However, some commodity strategists worry that a lack of compliance among OPEC+ members may nullify the additional cuts.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signed a memorandum of understanding today to return to production in the joint “neutral zone” shared by the two countries. That could eventually add 500,000 barrels a day to supplies, or 0.5% of global supply, experts say. However, market participants say the current production cuts could tamp down supplies in the short term.
