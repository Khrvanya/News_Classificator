Asian markets are at four-month highs and the Indian rupee was on the recovery mode on Friday. That may give Dalal Street a bullish bias in Monday's trade. But it remains to be seen if that can help the domestic indices close higher.
Here’s breaking down the pre-market actions.
Nifty futures on the Singapore Exchange traded 72 points, or 0.68 per cent higher at 10,660, in signs that Dalal Street was headed for a positive start on Monday.
Nifty50 on Friday topped the 10,600 mark on a closing basis. The 50-pack formed an indecisive candle on the daily chart, but a strong bullish candle on the weekly chart. Some technical indicators are reaching the overbought zone on the lower timeframe charts, and Nifty50 will need a strong close on Monday to avoid a sideways phase.
Asian shares held near four-month highs on Monday as investors counted on super-cheap liquidity and fiscal stimulus to sustain the global economic recovery. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.05 per cent. Eyes were on Chinese blue chips, which surged almost 7 per cent last week. Japan's Nikkei, however, has lagged with its domestic economy and was last up 0.4 per cent. E-Mini futures for the S&P500 firmed up 0.3 per cent.
US stocks will resume trade on Monday following Friday’s public holiday on account of Independence Day. On Friday, Germany's DAX edged 0.6 per cent lower to 12,528.18. The CAC40 in Paris dropped 0.8 per cent to 5,007.14, while Britain's FTSE closed down 1.3 per cent at 6,157.30.
Oil prices offered up a mixed market snapshot on Monday, with Brent crude edging higher, supported by tighter supplies, while US benchmark WTI futures dropped on concern that a spike in coronavirus cases could curb oil demand in the United States. Brent crude rose 11 cents, or 0.3 per cent, to $42.91 a barrel after a 4.3 per cent gain last week.
Net-net, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were buyers of domestic stocks to the tune of Rs 857.29 crore, data available with NSE suggested. DIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 331.96 crore, data suggests.
Nifty may have broken past the crucial hurdle of 10,551 at closing on Friday, but traders should adopt a cautious approach given the negative divergence of a couple of crucial indicators, derivatives analysts said. For one, the market-wide open interest put-call ratio was at 1.16 on Friday, lower than June 8's 1.26 when the Nifty was at 10,328, from where it corrected over the next few days to 9,544.
10-year bonds: India 10-year bond yield rose 0.07 per cent to 5.84 after trading in 5.84-5.87 range.
