Saudi Arabia launched an all-out oil war on Sunday with the biggest cut in its prices in the last 20 years, Bloomberg News reported, after a failure by cartel OPEC and its allies to clinch a deal to cut production.
A meeting of main producers was expected to agree to deeper cuts to counter the impact of the new coronavirus -- but Moscow refused to tighten supply.
For BPCL, other than the crash in brent crude prices, the government's decision to invite bids for a majority stake in the company boosted buying sentiment. On Saturday, more than three months after the Union Cabinet approved the strategic divestment, the government invited bids from private companies with a net worth of over $10 billion (Rs 74,000 crore).
"Based on the current market capitalisation of Rs 87,388 crore, the government stake of 52.98 per cent in BPCL is valued at around Rs 46,300 crore. This sale is key to meeting the government’s disinvestment target of Rs 2.1 trillion in the financial year 2020-21," the government said in a statement.
Further, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) made it clear that none of the public sector undertakings will be allowed to participate in the proposed stake sale, the bidding for which will close of May 2, 2020. READ MORE

Thus, BPCL with nearly 25 per cent market share in Indian petrol and diesel sales provides a lucrative entry point for a prospective buyer to capture the Indian growth story," analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL) wrote in a report. The brokerage maintains 'Neutral' call on the stock and value it at 1.9x (10 per cent discount to FY15-18) FY22 PBV to arrive at a target price of Rs 520.
