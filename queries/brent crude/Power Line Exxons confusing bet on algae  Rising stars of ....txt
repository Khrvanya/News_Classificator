Shell and BP are writing down up to $40 billion in assets. Here's what that means.
BP announced in mid-June that it's writing down oil and gas assets by as much as $17.5 billion. Now, Shell is following suit , with an announcement this week that it would write down its assets by up to $22 billion.
Write-downs, explained: When companies write down their assets it means they're acknowledging that those assets are worth less than the value they originally ascribed to them.
Why it matters: The write-downs are another example of the pandemic's toll on the oil and gas industry. They're also a sign that these companies are preparing for a lower-carbon economy.
The pandemic has gutted demand for oil, sending the price-per-barrel tumbling. Cheap oil and an outlook of lower demand makes oil-related assets less valuable.
These write-downs suggest that some oil and gas resources may be left in the ground.
BP said it expects the transition to low-carbon energy to accelerate in the wake of the pandemic when it announced the write-downs.
Oil price today: Brent crude started trading at $42 a barrel on Thursday, up about 6% since early June and down about 36% since the start of the year.
Price in 2021: $55 a barrel, on average , Goldman Sachs said in a note Wednesday. That's roughly $10 below where it was before the pandemic took hold.
In the note, Goldman analysts also shared their top stock picks for integrated oil companies and refiners, which turn crude into fuel and other products. You can see all of their picks here .
