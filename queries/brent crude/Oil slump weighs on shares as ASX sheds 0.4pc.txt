Australian shares declined on Wednesday, with energy companies leading the market lower as investors further fret about the future path of oil prices.
The S&P/ASX 200 index lost 0.4 per cent, or 21 points, to 5466.70, pulling back from early steep declines.
US stocks rallied on Tuesday after investors started to look toward at least a partial reopening of the US economy.  But the US gains couldn't lift the Australian market.
"I suspect that the market has had a good run up and is becoming a bit more vulnerable to a pullback," said AMP Capital head of investment strategy Shane Oliver. "Nothing goes up in a straight line."
"There's perhaps a bit more nervousness about US earnings reports. The fall in the oil price probably is weighing a bit," Dr Oliver said. "There's a feeling that OPEC hasn't done enough and the supply cutbacks aren't enough."
Energy companies sank on Wednesday, working to drag the market lower, as Woodside fell 3.6 per cent to $21.22 and Santos dropped 3.7 per cent to $4.39. Beach Energy lost 6.2 per cent to $1.37.
"Any meaningful supply-demand equilibrium will not be restored until there is clarity on the demand recovery," says Elliot Hentov, head of policy research, EMEA at State Street Global Advisors.
Westpac cut its year-end forecast for Brent crude oil to $US32 a barrel from $US50 a barrel, reflecting the "significant" hit to demand from COVID-19 .
Iron ore producers also declined during the session, with BHP down 0.7 per cent to $31.43, Rio Tinto down 1.2 per cent to $89.78 and Fortescue Metals Group down 1.5 per cent to $11.40.
Westpac kept its year-end forecast for iron ore at $US65 a tonne but the bank expects the iron ore price to fall by $US50 a tonne by June.
Investors are worried that a recovery in Chinese demand will not be enough to offset a surge in Australian supplies. China's central bank cut interest rates and injected $US14 billion ($21.8 billion) into the financial system on Wednesday.
Other blue chips weighing on the market included CSL, down 0.6 per cent to $324.15 and Telstra, which fell 1.3 per cent at $3.12.
Selected banks were lower as well, with Commonwealth Bank down 1.1 per cent at $62.07 and Macquarie down 0.8 per cent at $100.96.
QBE shares lost 3.5 per cent to $8.79 as shareholders parsed the insurer's plan to raise capital that was announced a day earlier. The company said it had successfully completed its $US750 million ($1.2 billion) institutional placement, issuing 14.5 million new shares at a price of $8.25 a share.
Magellan fell 3.8 per cent to $48.68. Morgan Stanley said it's remaining underweight on the fund manager as the stock is still too expensive.  The broker cut its price target from $50.00 to $40.00, saying it still had questions on retail flow resilience.
"Despite the recent de-rating, Magellan remains one of the most expensive traditional asset managers in developed markets," said analyst Andrei Stadnik.
Premier shares dropped 4.6 per cent at $13.36.
Macquarie cut its financial 2020 earnings forecast for Premier Investments by 33 per cent. The broker is assuming the retailer makes $26.7 million this year in reported earnings, down from its old forecast of $40.2 million, and the $106.7 million it made in the year ended last June 30.
The broker's forecasts for financial years 2021 and 2022 are little changed at $66.6 million and $122.3 million respectively.
