The urgent nature of reducing global supply comes amid a collapse in demand, as the global COVID-19 pandemic shut down large swaths of the world economy. The damage is filtering in recent economic data, with U.S. and Eurozone economies contracting sharply in the first quarter, data released this week shows. Economists and politicians alike warn the worst of the recession is yet to be seen in the second quarter as major global economies went into full lockdown in April.
In the United States, data released this morning showed initial unemployment claims surged another 3.389 million for the week ended April 25, at the high end of expectations, bringing the total number of first-time claims to 30.3 million over the most recent six week period.
Against this bearish backdrop, oil futures found support in end-month trading on early indications the worst may have passed, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicating Thursday the country has seen the peak in infections. Johnson himself was infected with COVID-19 and placed on a respirator earlier this month.
In the United States, gasoline demand has increased from a 5.065 million bpd nadir at the start of April to 5.86 million bpd last week, while states begin to open their economies.
