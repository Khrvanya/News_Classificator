The messages are simple but uplifting.
The front of the Platinum Ridge skilled nursing facility in Brackenridge was covered Tuesday morning with colorful and encouraging messages created by its workers.
The goal: To help alleviate the tension and uncertainty of the coronavirus crisis.
“We want to make everybody happy when they come in,” said Karla Langen, activities director at the facility along Broadview Boulevard.
There are about 87 residents at the facility. They have not been allowed to have visitors since March 13. Officials said there have been no confirmed cases of covid-19 at the facility.
“They are cooped up inside,” Langen said, noting that some residents have decorated their windows. “This helps them so they don’t get depressed.”
Dott Clever, a licensed practical nurse, said residents are supporting each other and staying connected to families via Facetime and other technology.
“We are trying to support one another,” said Clever of Vandergrift. “We want them to have fun to keep away all the negativity.”
