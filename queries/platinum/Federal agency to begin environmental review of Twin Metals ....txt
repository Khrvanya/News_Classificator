EYE ON MINING -- The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is set to begin its environmental impact statement on the proposed Twin Metals Mining project.
Twin Metals made the announcement Tuesday.
This begins the review process at the federal level under the National Environmental Policy Act,Â  and will begin a thorough analysis of the potential impacts and benefits of Twin Metals' copper-nickel-cobalt-platinum group metals mine near Ely.
A number of federal agencies and tribal groups will be involved in the process.
There will also be opportunities for the public to weigh in.
This will run parallel to the Minnesota DNR's environmental review.
A spokesperson for Twin Metals said this is a standard, but significant step in the process.
The company anticipates the BLM's environmental review to take a number of years to complete.
Twin Metals submitted its Mine Plan of Operation in December of 2019.
