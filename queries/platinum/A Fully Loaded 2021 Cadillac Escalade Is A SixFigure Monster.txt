GM's just launched the online configurator for the all-new Escalade.
The keystone in Cadillac's premium vehicle portfolio, the Cadillac Escalade , has been completely redesigned for the 2021 model year. And although it will be some months yet before the new full-size SUV starts production at GM's Arlington Assembly Plant in Texas, Cadillac has already launched an online Build & Price tool, allowing customers to get acquainted with the breadth of trims and optional extras they'll be faced with upon placing an order.
We've spent a bit of time getting acquainted with the new configurator, and learned that the Escalade's Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price will top out at around the $120,000 mark.
We can't put a more precise figure on that because, at the time of this writing, no price is specified for the Heavy-Duty Trailering Package, which comes with a two-speed transfer case, an auxiliary trailer cam, trailering assist guidelines, and a trailer tire pressure monitoring system. The Chevrolet Silverado's Advanced Trailering Package is priced at $490, but it's nowhere near as comprehensive in terms of content.
The configurator does highlight some notable facts about pricing, however, confirming that the available turbocharged 3.0L Duramax diesel engine is a no-cost option over the gasoline-fueled 6.2L V8, and offering GM's Super Cruise semi-autonomous system as a $2,500 stand-alone option.
Worth noting is that Super Cruise is not available on the base Luxury trim, and on the Sport and Premium Luxury models, it requires additional packages.
