Harry Barr, Chairman and CEO of New Age Metals, said: “We are very pleased to have a firm with IBK Capital’s global relationships in the mining sector working to explore ways to create value for our shareholders. We continue to develop our 100 percent owned River Valley Palladium Project located 60 miles from the Sudbury metallurgical complex in Sudbury, Ontario.
