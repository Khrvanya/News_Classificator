Lineage Cell Therapeutics, another anti-aging stock, works in the fields of regenerative medicine, human embryonic stem cell technology and induced pluripotent stem cell technology. It develops therapies that are based on stem cell biology and are intended to rebuild cell and tissue function lost due to degenerative diseases and injury.
In the company’s stem cell programs are OpRegen, which is a cell replacement therapy in a Phase 2 clinical trial to treat advanced dry age-related macular degeneration; OPC1, which is in a Phase 2a clinical trial for acute spinal cord injuries; and VAC2, which is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
This company is taking a different approach to age-related disease through the research and development of mitochondria-based therapeutics, an emerging class of drugs. A novel group of peptides encoded within the mitochondrial genome has been shown to regulate metabolism and cell death.
These treatments have widespread potential to target diseases related to aging and metabolic dysfunction, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system conditions.
This final anti-aging stock is a biopharmaceutical company that has a focus on identifying therapies that restore protein function. Proteostasis Therapeutics is developing small-molecule therapeutics to treat cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by dysfunctional protein processing.
It has a partnership with Astellas Pharma (OTC Pink: ALPMY ,TSE:4503) to research and identify therapies targeting the unfolded protein response pathway.
