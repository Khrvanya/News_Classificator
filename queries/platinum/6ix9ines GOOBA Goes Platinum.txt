Following his first number-one single in "TROLLZ," 6ix9ine's "GOOBA" has been officially certified platinum by the RIAA.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall -- at least, that's what the old idiom promises. It's one that many rappers, from Future to Gucci Mane, Meek Mill to G-Herbo , have been quietly holding out hope for. That one day, the fervor surrounding Tekashi 6ix9ine , which recently manifested itself into a bonafide number one Billboard hit, would simply cease. Evidently, it is not this day. In fact, it can even be argued that the buzz surrounding the Rainbow Wonder has never been bigger.
It's gotten to the point where his recent single "GOOBA," his first release since he return from incarceration, has officially earned the rapper another Platinum Plaque for his already extensive collection. A collection that boasts sixteen plaques, eight platinum, eight gold. "He can’t have a career after he gets out of jail AND IM NUMBER ONE YOU HATE TO SEE IT," jokes 6ix9ine, seemingly incapable of turning off his trollish persona for a single waking moment.
Of course, the legions of haters are precisely what give him the ammunition to play the victim to begin with -- and given how he seemingly thrives in an "underdog" role, perhaps it's time to look forward shifting the narrative. Perhaps, if he is allowed to simply coexist with his fellow artists, some of his allure may end up simply fading. True, he'll always have his core fanbase, but until he stops drawing such powerful reactions from those who actively dislike him, things will likely keep on keeping on.
