Spot price of palladium hits an all-time high of more than US$2,100 an ounce, while the price of rhodium hits a ten-year high of US$8,200 an ounce
Independent feasibility study underway on a smaller-scale, lower-capital-cost mine development plan to accelerate initial production by using Shaft 1 as a production shaft
Mokopane, South Africa--(Newsfile Corp. - January 14, 2020) - Ivanhoe Mines' (TSX: IVN) (OTCQX: IVPAF) Co-Chairmen Robert Friedland and Yufeng "Miles" Sun announced today that the company's South African subsidiary, Ivanplats, is fast-tracking a feasibility study on a smaller-scale, early-stage development plan using Shaft 1 as a production shaft at its Platreef palladium, platinum, nickel, copper, gold and rhodium mining licence, located on the Northern Limb of the Bushveld Complex in South Africa's Limpopo province.
Spot prices of palladium and rhodium - two key metals contained in the Platreef ore - have soared in recent months, propelling Platreef's 'metals-price basket' to a new, all-time high.
An independent feasibility study is underway to review Ivanhoe's planned smaller-scale, early-stage, lower-capital-cost production plan. Ivanhoe's plan would accelerate the mine's first production by using Shaft 1 as the mine's initial production shaft, followed by expansions to the production rate outlined in the project's 2017 definitive feasibility study. Ivanhoe's smaller-scale mine design also is optimized to target the highest-grade areas of the mineral resource in close vicinity to Shaft 1.
Platreef's Shaft 1 currently is at a depth of 957 metres below surface. It is scheduled to be completed to a final depth of approximately 1,000 metres by the end of July, 2020. Work on Shaft 1's 950-metre-level station - the shaft's third and final station - is expected to be completed in March, 2020.
Palladium price hits all-time high; rhodium price reaches 10-year high
Palladium prices continue to surge to record highs, topping US$2,100 an ounce as stricter air-quality rules boost demand for the metal used in vehicle pollution-control devices. Platreef has an estimated 26.8 million ounces of palladium in current Indicated Mineral Resources, and an additional 43.0 million ounces in current Inferred Mineral Resources, at a 2.0 g/t 3PE+gold cut-off.
Platreef has an estimated 1.8 million ounces of rhodium in current Indicated Mineral Resources, and an additional 3.1 million ounces in current Inferred Mineral Resources, at a 2.0 g/t 3PE+gold cut-off. The rhodium in the Platreef ore is strongly correlated with both palladium and platinum.
Rhodium is a rare platinum-group metal that is chemically stable at high temperatures, resistant to corrosion and mainly used with palladium and platinum in the production of automobile catalytic converters that curb harmful emissions. Approximately 80% of the world's rhodium supply comes from mines in South Africa, and global production of rhodium is only approximately one million ounces annually.
The price of rhodium has surged 32% already this month, attaining a price of more than US$8,200 an ounce - the highest price since it hit more than US$10,000 an ounce in 2008.
In addition to the surge in the price of rhodium and palladium, recent increases in the price of nickel, copper and gold has resulted in the weighted price of the 'basket' of metals contained in the ore at Platreef to rise to a new, multi-year high.

Notes for Figures 1 and 2:
Based on Platreef Mineral Reserves with an effective date of May 24, 2017.
Probable Mineral Reserve of 124.7 million tonnes at a grade of 1.95 grams per tonne (g/t) platinum, 2.01 g/t palladium, 0.30 g/t gold, 0.14 g/t rhodium, 0.34% nickel and 0.17% copper.
A declining NSR cut-off of $155 per tonne (t) to $80/t was used for the Mineral Reserve estimates.
The NSR cut-off is an elevated cut-off above the marginal economic cut-off.
Metal prices used in the Mineral Reserve estimate: US$1,600 per ounce (oz) platinum, US$815/oz palladium, US$1,300/oz gold, US$1,500/oz rhodium, US$8.90 per pound (lb) nickel and US$3.00/lb copper.
Metal prices used in the DFS economic analysis: US$1,250/oz platinum, US$825/oz palladium, US$1,300/oz gold, US$1,000/oz rhodium, US$7.60/lb nickel and US$3.00/lb copper.
Tonnage and grade estimates include dilution and mining recovery allowances.
Applies life-of-mine average recoveries of 87.4% for platinum, 86.9% for palladium, 78.6% for gold, 80.5% for rhodium, 87.9% for copper and 71.9% for nickel.
Total cash cost includes mine site costs, plus realization costs such as treatment and refining charges, royalties and transportation.
LT Street Consensus is based on a survey of brokers' long-term metal prices estimates and includes: US$1,000/oz platinum, US$1,150/oz palladium, US$1,350/oz gold, US$1,820/oz rhodium, US$7.08/lb nickel and US$3.00/lb copper.
Since 2007, Ivanhoe has focused its exploration and development activities at Platreef on defining and advancing the underground Flatreef Deposit, which is amenable to highly mechanized, underground mining methods. Flatreef, with a strike length of 6.5 kilometres, lies predominantly within a flat-to gently-dipping portion of the Platreef mineralized belt at relatively shallow depths of approximately 500 metres to 1,350 metres below surface. Flatreef is characterized by its very large vertical thicknesses of high-grade mineralization.
The Platreef Project's current Mineral Resource estimate, which does not include any near-surface mineralization, was prepared for Ivanhoe Mines under the direction of Dr. Harry Parker, RM SME, of Amec Foster Wheeler. Dr. Parker and Timothy Kuhl, RM SME, also of Amec Foster Wheeler, have independently confirmed the Mineral Resource estimate and are the Qualified Persons for the estimate, which has an effective date of April 22, 2016.
Platreef's current Indicated Mineral Resources are 346 million tonnes at a grade of 3.77 grams per tonne (g/t) 3PE+gold (1.68 g/t platinum, 1.70 g/t palladium, 0.11 g/t rhodium, 0.28 g/t gold), 0.32% nickel and 0.16% copper at a 2.0 g/t 3PE+gold cut-off. The average thickness of the 2.0 g/t 3PE+gold grade shell used to constrain the T2MZ (Merensky Reef equivalent) resources for the indicated area is 19 metres.
Platreef's current Indicated Mineral Resources contain an estimated 26.8 million ounces of palladium, 25.6 million ounces of platinum, 4.5 million ounces of gold, and 1.8 million ounces of rhodium (a combined 58.7 million ounces of PGMs plus gold), plus 4.1 billion pounds of nickel and 2.1 billion pounds of copper, at a cut-off grade of 1 gram per tonne.
Platreef's current Inferred mineral resources are 506 million tonnes at a grade of 3.24 g/t 3PE+gold (1.42 g/t platinum, 1.46 g/t palladium, 0.10 g/t rhodium, 0.26 g/t gold), 0.31% nickel and 0.16% copper. The average thickness of the 2.0 g/t 3PE+gold grade shell used to constrain the T2MZ resources for the inferred area is 12.7 metres.
Platreef's current Inferred Mineral Resources contain an additional 43.0 million ounces of palladium, 40.4 million ounces of platinum, 7.8 million ounces of gold, and 3.1 million ounces of rhodium (a combined 94.3 million ounces PGMs plus gold), plus 7.7 billion pounds of nickel and 4.1 billion pounds of copper, also at a cut-off grade of 1 gram per tonne.
