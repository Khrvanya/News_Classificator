What  a day we saw Wednesday in the metals across the board. Gold charged higher,  reaching 1807 in August futures before failing miserably touching, 1767 and  closing at 1780. The key was the close around 1780, which keeps the run to  possible new highs open.
Silver mimicked gold and reached a double top from mid-May at about 18.90 in  September futures before collapsing to 18.09 and closing the day at 18.28. The  critical level of $18 keeps silver in a bullish formation suggesting a much  bigger run to the upside.
Platinum ,  which remains in a downtrend, failed at 860 in October futures, indicating that  the bear trend is still there. It appears that platinum is starting to  consolidate, which can mean one of two things, either the Bertsch is over or  it's resting before heading lower.
Saturday  Micro Mini Recording: Saturday did a great webinar on our micro  mini futures portfolio models. I have attached the recording for your viewing  pleasure.
