Vehicle repair firm the Vella Group has signed to take a 15,700 sq ft unit at Infrared Capital Partner’s Knowsley industrial complex on a 10-year lease as it looks to increase its North West presence.
The Vella Group has several sites across the North West including in Chester, Preston, Skelmersdale and Southport. Its Platinum Court unit is the firm’s eighth branch.
Platinum Court, comprising 10 units providing a total of 93,000 sq ft, is part of the wider Alchemy Business Park and is located just off the A580 and the M57 north of Knowsley.
The complex is also home to newspaper distributor Smith News Trading, energy company National Grid Gas and Applied Medical UK, which manufactures devices for the healthcare industry.
NSM Property was the agent for the deal.
Dave Harrison, head of property for NSM in the North West, said: “Now fully let, the scheme is helping to regenerate a significantly deprived area and create new job opportunities for local people.
The Vella Group operations director, Mike Sarsfield added: “As part of our ongoing growth plans, we wanted to expand our footprint into the Liverpool area.
“The location of Platinum Court provides great access to the greater Liverpool area, and also further afield. The premises itself is modern, secure and fits with the image we want to portray for a professional repair centre.”
