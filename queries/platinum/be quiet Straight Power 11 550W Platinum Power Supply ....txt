The new Straight Power 11 model with 550W max power is now certified as 80 PLUS Platinum and features a dead silent operation.
The Straight Power 11 Platinum model with 550W max power is silent, achieves satisfactory overall performance and uses quality parts. The performance difference with the previous model is small, though.
The new Straight Power 11 Platinum model with 550W max power has a small overall performance difference with the previous Gold model, despite the new platform that FSP used. To make matters worse, it uses an inferior 5VSB circuit, with notably lower efficiency levels. The competition is hard with the Fractal Design Ion+ 560P and the Seasonic Focus Platinum model with similar capacity being better choices. The Corsair RM550x , our best power supply pick in the 550W category, also achieves higher performance despite the lower efficiency certification in the 80 PLUS scheme (in Cybenetics, both the RM550x and the Straight Power 11 Platinum 550 have the same efficiency rating, ETA-A).
There are two Straight Power (SP) 11 lines in be quiet's portfolio right now, one with Gold-certified members and capacities ranging from 450W to 1000W and one with Platinum models and 550W up to 1200W max power. We don't know, yet, if the older Straight Power 11 line will remain in the market, or will be replaced by the new one. For the moment, both are listed on the brand's official page.
Besides the different min and max capacities of their models and the efficiency certifications, another significant difference between the SP Gold and Platinum lines is the new platform that the new models utilize. The OEM remains FSP, which uses a fresh design featuring a full-bridge topology instead of the half-bridge that the older models used. Moreover, only the SP Platinum 550W model is equipped with a single EPS connector, with all the rest featuring two of those connectors. In the SP Gold line, the 450W, 550W, and 650W models come with a single EPS connector.
