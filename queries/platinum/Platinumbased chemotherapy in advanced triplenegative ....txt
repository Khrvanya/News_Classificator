Platinum‐based chemotherapy in advanced triple‐negative breast cancer: A multicenter real‐world study in China
International Journal of Cancer|June 29, 2020
In multicenter real‐world settings, this inquiry was performed among patients with advanced triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) in order to compare the effectiveness of platinum‐based chemotherapy (PBC) and non‐PBC in these patients. Overall participants were 495, receiving PBC (n = 350) or non‐PBC (n = 145) at four cancer centers in China between 2003 and 2019. In terms of objective response rate (ORR) and median progression‐free survival (PFS), PBC was found superior to non‐PBC in first‐line treatment, whereas overall survival(OS) was identified to be similar. The same trend was noted in ORR, median first‐line PFS and median first‐line OS on comparing those receiving non‐PBC doublets (n = 221) vs those receiving PBC doublets (n = 249). The use of paclitaxel/docetaxel+platinum was more likely, followed by gemcitabin+platinum. A similar response and survival was afforded by PBC, in second/third‐line treatment, vs non‐PBC. Findings revealed that in terms of ORR, PFS, and OS, it was better to add PBC in the first‐line therapy than that in the latter‐line of treatment. PBC was associated with tolerable toxic effects, and neutropenia (38.6%) was documented as the most common adverse event. Superior efficacy as well as manageable toxicity was shown by PBC doublets vs non‐PBC doublets in the first‐line treatment for Chinese mTNBC patients.
