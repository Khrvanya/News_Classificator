According to SeaNews Russian Foreign Trade Customs Statistics online service, the export of platinum group metals from Russia in 2019 amounted to 112.4 tons (-15.5% year-on-year) worth $5.1 bn (+40.2%).
In 2019, platinum group metals were shipped from Russia to 20 countries. The major importers were the USA, the UK, Japan, Germany and Italy. Almost all shipments (both in physical and monetary terms) were made from Moscow.
Metals of the platinum group are 6 metal elements: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum proper. They have similar physical and chemical properties and are usually found in the same deposits. Platinum group metals are precious.
Platinum group metals are used both separately and in alloys. Platinum metal alloys are harder, stronger and more corrosion resistant than individual metals.
Since the mid-1970s, platinum and palladium have been used in the automotive industry. Due to their unique catalytic properties, these metals are used to purify exhaust gases in automobiles from harmful substances.
Platinum group metals are used to make details for mechanisms deployed in corrosive environments in various technological devices, reactors, electric heaters, high-temperature furnaces, etc. In electric engineering, they are used to produce contacts with a high degree of reliability. Magnetic alloys of these metals are used in manufacturing small-size electrical appliances. The catalytic properties of some metals of this group allow for their use as catalysts.
And, of course, platinum and other metals of the platinum group are used in jewelry, and as bank deposits by individuals and companies.
