are all commodities and have inflation hedge characteristics. Copper and platinum also have industrial uses, and the copper/gold and platinum/gold ratios should signal upturns in the global cycle. In the last two market bottoms, the platinum/gold ratio bottomed out ahead of the stock market bottom, while the copper/gold ratio was roughly coincident with stock prices. Currently, both of these ratios are plunging, and there is no early signal of a cyclical bottom.
Commodity prices also led or were coincident with stock prices at the last two major market bottoms. The CRB Index now is still weak, and shows no signs of a durable bottom.
Metal prices also show a similar lead-lag pattern with stock prices. While gold  has its unique characteristics and bullion marches to the beat of its own drummer, silver SI00,
, copper  , and platinum   all turned up ahead of stock prices at the last two bear market bottoms. There is no evidence of any similar buy signals today from any of these commodities.
Market bottoms are also characterized by changes in leadership. Bear markets are forms of creative destruction. The old leaders from the last cycle, whose dominance become overdone, falter, and new market leaders emerge. Instead, the old leadership of U.S. over global stocks, growth over value, and large-cap over small-caps are all still in place.
I am doubtful that a new bull market can begin with technical conditions like this.
3. Valuation headwinds: Another challenge for the long-term bull case is valuation. The S&P SPX,
s currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 17.3, which is above its 5-year average of 16.7 and 10-year average of 15.0. Moreover, we are entering first-quarter earnings season, and the “E” in the forward P/E ratio is going to be revised substantially downwards.

How far down? Consider that FactSet reported consensus bottom-up estimate is 152.81 for 2020, and 178.03 for 2021. By contrast, most of the top-down estimates I have seen for 2020 is in the 115-120 range, and the 2021 estimate is about 150. Those are very wide spreads between top-down and bottom-up estimates. The gap will be closed mainly with falling bottom-up estimates, rather than rising top-down upward revisions.
As a quantitative equity strategist, I have learned that whenever a country experiences an unexpected shock, all quantitative factors stop working. They then begin to work again in the following order:
First the price technical factors start to convey information about the market. Next comes the top-down strategist estimates, followed by the bottom-up estimates. That's because everyone knows the shock is bad, but no one can quite quantify the effects. The top-down strategists first run their macro models and come up with some ballpark estimates, but the company analysts cannot revise their estimates until they have fully analyzed the companies and industries to be able to revise their earnings. That's where we are now in the market cycle.
The final stage of the adjustment occurs when most of the damage is known, and fundamental factors like value and growth start to work again. We are far from that phase.
With that preface, let's then consider the U.S. market's valuation . I went back to 1982 and analyzed the market's forward P/E ratio at major market bottoms. The 1982 bottom was an anomaly, as the market bottomed out at a forward P/E of about 6 because of the nosebleed interest rates of the Volcker era. The 2002-2003 bottom saw a forward P/E ratio of about 14. Those are the two outliers. The 1987, 1990, 2009, and 2011 bottoms all saw forward P/E ratios of about 10. All of these episodes occurred during backdrops of very different interest rate regimes. Can a new bull market begin today at a forward P/E of 15, with an uncertain “E” that is dropping quickly?
Here is how I arrive at the downside potential for the S&P 500, assuming the top-down estimates of 120 for 2020, and 150 for 2021. Supposing that the market bottoms out today, or did at the end of March, then forward 12-month EPS would be 75% of 120 + 25% of 150 = 127.50. Applying a P/E multiple range of 10-12, we arrive at a range of 1275-1530 for the S&P 500. Using the same methodology, a June 2020 bottom yields a 12-month forward EPS of 135, and a price range for the S&P 500 of 1350-1620. A September 2020 bottom results in a forward EPS of 142.50, and price range of 1425-1710.
For investors who believe that P/E ratios should be adjusted for interest rates, Callum Thomas of Topdown Charts calculated the equity risk premium of the U.S. equity market based on CAPE. While current levels are starting to look cheap, they are nowhere near the compelling readings that are usually found at past major market bottoms.
4. What are smart investors doing? Here is another way of thinking about valuation. Insiders stepped up and bought heavily during the most recent downdraft , but this group of "smart investors" backed away as the market rose.
To be sure, insider buying is an inexact market timing signal. Insiders were too early and too eager to buy during the initial decline in 2008. They were also early in 2018.
For the last word on this topic, here is all you need to know about "smart investors". At the bottom of the market during the Great Financial Crisis, Warren Buffett stepped in to rescue Goldman Sachs when the Goldman sold an expensive convertible preferred to Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A,
