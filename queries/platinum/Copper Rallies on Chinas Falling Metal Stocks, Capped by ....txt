Copper futures are rallying to start the trading week, driven by a decline in China’s metals inventories. The industrial metal has witnessed renewed support from traders as they ramp up their long-term bets. However, copper prices were capped on intensifying concerns over the coronavirus and the possibility of a second wave affecting the world.
July copper futures surged $0.0425, or 1.63%, to $2.6535 per pound at 18:46 GMT on Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The red metal enjoyed a 1.6% weekly gain last week, paring its year-to-date decline to around 5%.
Chinese data is in focus to kick off the trading week as the latest inventory data suggest demand is ballooning in the world’s second-largest economy. Copper supplies in Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored warehouses slumped by 14.2% to an 18-month low of 109,696 tons in the week ending June 19. Overall, copper stockpiles are down 71% since peaking at 380,085 tons in March.
The country has seen a decline in inventories of a wide variety of metals, including zinc, copper, and iron ore. Chinese buyers are importing many metals to make up for the shortfall, rising 12.4% in the first five months of 2020 compared to the same time a year ago.
But could a second wave of the coronavirus shut down the global economy again? Investors contracted a case of the jitters on Monday when the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic was accelerating after experiencing the largest single-day jump in cases in two months . Over the week, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases topped 8.88 million.
China has seen an uptick in cases across the country, resulting in authorities reimplementing lockdowns in many pockets of the nation.
Meanwhile, various reports indicate that investors have been raising their long-term bets on copper, suggesting that they think the global economy will be successful in its recovery.
A slumping US dollar is also helping copper prices. The US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, plummeted 0.61% to 97.03, from an opening of 97.66. The index has erased most of its gains in 2020 as international financial markets stabilize. A weaker buck is good for commodities priced in dollars because it makes it cheaper for foreign investors to acquire.
In other metal commodities, August gold futures advanced $14.70, or 0.83%, to $1,767.70 per ounce. July silver futures jumped $0.063, or 0.35%, to $17.91 an ounce. July platinum futures soared $17.20, or 2.08%, to $844.50 an ounce. July palladium futures spiked $31.60, or 1.66%, to $1,940.00 per ounce.
