NEW DELHI: Global commodity market witnessed severe selling pressure on Monday, in line with the equities, amid fears that the rising coronavirus cases may severely impact the global economy.
Brent oil prices crashed nearly 10 per cent during the day, while precious metals pack also nosedived, with platinum falling more than 25 per cent to hit a 17.5-year low. Investors dumped hard assets in favour of cash after a US rate cut failed to stem a coronavirus-led selloff.
An emergency rate cut by the US Federal Reserve also failed to calm global financial markets while a price war raged on between the top oil producers.
The Fed slashed interest rates on Sunday night in its second emergency cut this month and said it would expand its balance sheet by at least $700 billion in the coming weeks in a bid to ease tension in financial markets.
Commenting on the oil price drop, Karan Shah, Commodity and Currency Analyst, Indiabulls Securities, said: “Oil prices came under intense pressure on both demand and supply sides, worries about the coronavirus pandemic, slashing oil buying persist, while oversupply fears have grown after top exporter Saudi Arabia ramped up output and slashed prices to increase sales to consumers in Asia and Europe.”
Gold broke its psychological $1,500 per ounce level. The commodity traded 4.50 per cent down at $1,459 per troy ounce at around 5.20 pm (IST). Silver traded nearly 18 per cent down at $12 per ounce.
In the domestic market, gold jumped Rs 455 to Rs 41,610 per 10 gram in Delhi amid rupee depreciation. Silver prices , however, dropped by Rs 1,283 to Rs 40,304 per kg from Rs 41,587.
Globally, the precious metals are caught up in a broader tumble in stock markets, as the coronavirus continued to spread rapidly, with some investors obliged to sell assets to cover margin calls, Reuters reported.
