Eurasia Mining said platinum production had been limited by contractor issues at its West Kytlim operation in Russia.
Just 66 kilograms, or 2,122 ounces, of platinum had been approved by authorities as the maximum approved production limit for 2019, due to 'delays and inconsistencies by the original contractor', the company said.
The amounts of the other metals, such as palladium, iridium, rhodium and gold, remained to be tallied.
Metal grades and stripping ratio in the 2019 season were on the same level as in the 2018 season.
Eurasia Mining had since shift operations from the contractor to its own in-house capability.
'We are now taking control of the established mine and have the necessary people and machinery in place to run it,' chairman Christian Schaffalitzky said.
'Contracting in the early years was necessary to build our own team on the ground, however it resulted in relying on potentially unsustainable production due to the contractor's own priorities.'
