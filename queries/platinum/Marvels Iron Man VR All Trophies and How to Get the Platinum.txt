As Trophy lists go, the list for Iron Man VR is fairly straightforward. There are one or two bumps on the road to the Platinum, but you can get most or all the Trophies in one playthrough. A lot of the Trophies come simply by playing each story mission, but there are some extra tasks you'll need to do to get everything.
Difficulty Trophies stand in your way; if you want the Platinum, you'll need to beat all missions on the hardest setting. You'll also need to complete all the optional challenge missions.
There are 42 Trophies to collect in Marvel's Iron Man VR, including the Platinum. Here's a complete list of every Trophy in the game, their descriptions, and how to obtain them all.
