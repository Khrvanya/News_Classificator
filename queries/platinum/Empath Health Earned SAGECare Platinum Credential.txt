Empath Health has earned the SAGECare Platinum Credential through SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders), a national advocacy and services organization providing training and consulting on LGBT aging issues in order to improve the lives of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender seniors. The Platinum Credential, the organization’s highest level, shows Empath’s commitment for LGBT elders with in-depth on-going staff training that helps offer meaningful ways to best support this community and create genuinely inclusive services.
“We are committed to the highest level of care for all of our patients, participants and their caregivers and families as we respect and honor their individual needs and perspectives,” said Rafael J. Scuillo, president & CEO of Empath Health. “We also understand many LGBT older adults have experienced discrimination, social stigma and prejudice and we need to be able to meet them where they are so we can address their needs with compassion and awareness.”
Empath staff and leadership completed in-depth training through SAGECare for the credentialing and the agency will continue to look for ways we can better reach out and support everyone in our communities.
