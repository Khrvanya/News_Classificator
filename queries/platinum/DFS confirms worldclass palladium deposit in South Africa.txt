Dual-listed Platinum Group Metals’ results from an independent definitive feasibility study on its Waterberg project confirms it to be a world-class nature palladium deposit with the potential to be one of the largest fully mechanised, low cost PGM mines in the world.
International and DRA Projects SA along with a large team of specialists.
Highlights of the DFS include:
A significant increase in mineral reserves from the project’s 2016 pre-feasibility study (PFS) for a large-scale, shallow, decline-accessible, mechanised, palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium (4E) mine. Use of backfill in the DFS design lowers risk and increases mined ore extraction rates.
An annual steady state production rate of 420 000 4E ounces, which
is a lower production rate than in the PFS. This result is by careful design in
order to reduce capital costs and simplify construction and ramp-up.
An after-tax net present value (NPV) of US$982 million, at an 8%
real discount rate, using spot metal prices as at 4 September 2019 (Incl. $1 546/oz).
An after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 20.7% at spot prices.
Estimated project capital of approximately $874 million, including
cut-off of 1 250 m.
R. Michael Jones, CEO and co-founder of Platinum Group says:
The Waterberg project will create approximately 1 100 new highly skilled jobs and a significant investment in local training and business opportunities is part of the benefits to stakeholders including local communities, shareholders, provincial and national governments.
