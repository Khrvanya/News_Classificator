Good performance and silent operation at a decent price.
The Fractal Design Ion+ Platinum 760 offers good performance, silent operation, and an easy installation, thanks to its highly flexible modular cables.
The competition to get into PC's is tough in the 750-850W range; as you can see clearly in our best power supplies ranking, Seasonic and Corsair dominate. Fractal Design tries to fight back, though, with the Ion+ Platinum 760W, which achieves good performance and keeps its noise output levels low. The cherry on top is the modular cables, which are highly flexible. Fractal Design managed to keep the price down, and still offer a warranty period as high as competitors like Corsair's RM750x and Seasonic's Focus Plus Platinum 750 .
We have already evaluated three members of the Ion+ line, the 560P , 660P and 860P , so it was high time to take a look at the second strongest member of the series, the 760P. All Ion+ units use a High Power platform that has good build quality and offers performance levels that meet the competition. The main advantages of the Ion+ 760P, besides its high-efficiency levels (80 Plus Platinum and Cybenetics ETA-A), are the quality FDB fan, the flexible modular cables and the electrolytic caps that High Power used, which are provided by Japanese manufacturers.
