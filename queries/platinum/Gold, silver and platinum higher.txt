The metals  continue to show some strength and could start to run higher. After a couple of  false starts, gold , silver and platinum are once again building momentum to  break out to the upside. They are all at key levels of resistance. Gold must  break through $1,715 in the June futures, silver $16 in the May futures and  platinum $750 in the July futures.
With the Fed  continuing to scramble with monetary policy, the case for metals becomes  stronger. Combine that with the patterns and the metals could be off to the  races. The only questions are the volume, which is low, and general market  conditions.
There is no  reason to believe the rally in the metals will not last for an extended period  of time. We remain long but understand the price action can change and we could  reverse. Trends last until they donâ€™t, and for now the trend in metals is  higher.
