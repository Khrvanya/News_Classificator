Gold fell more than 1% on Monday as the dollar hovered near a more than one-week high, but the metal held above $1,700 an ounce, buoyed by fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections.
Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1,719.67 per ounce. U.S. gold futures was down 0.6% at $1,726.50 per ounce.
"In a risk-off mood, the dollar becomes a favorable asset and that's pressuring gold," said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. "But since the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, we have been crawling down because the gold market did not get more monetary stimulus from the Fed; no additional rate cuts or asset purchases."
The Fed maintained its key overnight interest rate in target range of zero to 0.25 percent last week. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased but still held near a more than one-week high hit in the previous session.
Beijing has recorded dozens of new cases in recent days, while new infections in record numbers swept through more U.S. states.

But virus fears pressured Wall Street, keeping gold above the key psychological level of $1,700 an ounce, with analysts saying the long-term trajectory for gold was still positive.
