Whatâ€™s going to happen to your miles now that travel is at a standstill?
Anyone who flies Emirates regularily knows just how hard it is to retain those hard-earned tier miles. As a frequent flier, there's nothing better than the email ping letting you know that you've been moved up from Blue to a Silver, Gold or Platinum membership.
As most recreational travel has now come to a complete standstill, Emirates Skywards Silver, Gold and Platinum members, with a tier status review between March 2020 and September 2020 who are unable to retain their existing tier, will have their existing status extended until December 31, 2020.
According to Emirates, members with reviews before March 1, 2021 receive 12-month status extensions with a caveat; they must meet 80% of the usual travel requirements. Also, miles expiring in 2020 are being extended until the end of the year.
Emirates Skywards Silver, Gold and Platinum members with a tier review date prior to 1 April 2021 will retain their current status for a further 12 months with just 70% of the usual travel requirements.
