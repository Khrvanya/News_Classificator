The latter has more than doubled over the past 18 months as the introduction of stricter emissions standards boosted demand and widened a supply deficit.
Platinum rose as much as 3.2 per cent before paring some gains as the announcement marked one of the first signs that manufacturers can overcome technical barriers to using the metal to replace palladium.
The auto industry took a step nearer to curbing its dependence on palladium after BASF SE developed a new catalyst technology for gasoline cars that substitutes some of the metal with cheaper platinum. The technology, funded by two South African platinum miners, has been tested and doesn’t compromise emissions standards, BASF said Tuesday. Platinum rose as much as 3.2 per cent before paring some gains as the announcement marked one of the first signs that manufacturers can overcome technical barriers to using the metal to replace palladium. The latter has more than doubled over the past 18 months as the introduction of stricter emissions standards boosted demand and widened a supply deficit. Partial substitution might not fully eliminate the palladium deficit, but would boost platinum, according to the World Platinum Investment Council. Platinum has languished as consumers turned away from the diesel vehicles in which the metal is mainly used. It’s now just over a third of the price of palladium. Neither BASF nor its partners --Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. --disclosed how much platinum the new catalyst would use. BASF didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
