The be quiet! Straight Power 11 Platinum with 650W capacity (E11-PT-650) offers dead silent operation and has compact dimensions. Are those two features enough, though, to match opponents like the formidable Corsair RM650x and the Seasonic Focus Plus Platinum 650W ? Although the RM650x has a lower efficiency rating in the 80 PLUS scheme, still its overall performance is notably higher than the E11-PT-650, and the same goes, of course, for the Seasonic model. Given the high prices of all be quiet! products in the US, there is no reason to select the E11-PT-650 over the two products mentioned above. It's a solid choice but not one of the best power supplies .
The new Straight Power 11 Platinum line from be quiet! is made by FSP, like the previous one, and uses a new platform featuring a full-bridge topology. The Straight Power 11 Platinum models start from 550W and go up to 1200W, for users that need more power. The older, Gold, line starts from 450W and reaches up to 1000W. Besides the different capacities, the number of EPS connectors has also been increased in the new models. Only the E11-PT-550 comes with a single EPS, with all the other models featuring two, except the 650W and 750W units, which have three EPS connectors! There is no need, of course, for three EPS in any power supply. The E11-PT-750W and 650W might come with three EPS connectors, but only two of them can be used at the same time, with both of them hosted on the same cable. You can read more on this below, in the cable and connectors description.
