Vancouver, British Columbia and Johannesburg, South Africa--(Newsfile Corp. - January 14, 2020) - Platinum Group Metals Ltd. (TSX: PTM) (NYSE American: PLG) ("Platinum Group" "PTM" or the "Company") reports the Company's financial results for the three months ended November 30, 2019 and provides a summary of recent events and outlook.
The Company is focused on advancing the palladium dominant Waterberg Project located on the North Limb of the Bushveld Complex in South Africa (the "Waterberg Project"). An independent Definitive Feasibility Study for the Waterberg Project (the "Waterberg DFS") was published on September 24, 2019 and was unanimously approved by the shareholders of Waterberg JV Resources (Pty) Limited ("Waterberg JV Co.") on December 5, 2019. The Waterberg DFS concludes that the Waterberg Project will be one of the largest and potentially lowest cash cost underground PGM mines globally.
The Waterberg DFS projects a fully mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium ("4E") mine at an annual production rate of 420,000 4E ounces and a 45 year mine life. The Waterberg DFS was managed by Waterberg JV Co. representing the joint venture owners, being Platinum Group, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. ("Implats"), Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation ("JOGMEC"), Hanwa Co. Ltd. and Mnombo Wethu Consultants (Pty) Ltd.

Hosken Consolidated Investments Limited ("HCI"), an existing major shareholder of the Company, subscribed for 1,612,931 common shares through Deepkloof Limited ("Deepkloof"), a wholly owned subsidiary of HCI, increasing HCI's effective ownership percentage in the Company to approximately 31.67%.
On December 5, 2019 the shareholders of Waterberg JV Co. formally approved the Waterberg DFS. Within 90 business days of this approval Implats may elect to exercise a purchase and development option (the "Purchase and Development Option") to increase its stake in Waterberg JV Co. from 15% to 50.01% by purchasing an additional 12.195% equity interest from JOGMEC for $34.8 million and earning a further 22.815% interest by making a firm commitment to an expenditure of $130.0 million in development work. Implats made a strategic investment of $30.0 million in November 2017 to purchase an initial 15% stake in the project.
On September 24, 2019 the Company published the results of the Waterberg DFS. The associated technical report entitled "Independent Technical Report, Waterberg Project Definitive Feasibility Study and Mineral Resource Update, Bushveld Complex, South Africa" dated October 4, 2019 was SEDAR filed on October 7, 2019. Key findings of the Waterberg DFS include:
• Annual Steady State production rate of 420,000 4E ounces. Estimated mine life of 45 years on current reserves. The planned production rate is by careful design in order to reduce capital costs and simplify construction and ramp-up.
• After-tax Net Present Value ("NPV") of $982 million, at an 8% real discount rate, using spot metal prices as at September 4, 2019 (Incl. $1,546 Pd/oz) ("Spot Prices").
• After-tax NPV of $333 million, at an 8% real discount rate, using three-year trailing average metal prices up until September 4, 2019 (Incl. $1,055 Pd/oz) ("Three Year Trailing Prices").
• After-tax Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") of 20.7% at Spot Prices and 13.3% at Three Year Trailing Prices.
• Peak project funding estimated at $617 million.
• On site life of mine average cash cost (inclusive of by-product credits and smelter discounts) for the spot price scenario equates to $640 per 4E ounce.
• Updated measured and indicated mineral resources[1] of 242.4 million tonnes at 3.38g/t 4E for 26.4 million 4E ounces (using 2.5 g/t 4E cut-off) and the deposit remains open on strike to the north and below a depth cut-off of 1,250-meters.
• Proven and probable mineral reserves[2] of 187.5 million tonnes at 3.24 g/t 4E for 19.5 million 4E ounces (using 2.5 g/t 4E cut-off), a significant increase from the Waterberg Project's 2016 Pre-Feasibility Study.
On August 21, 2019 the Company closed a public offering of securities on a bought deal basis in the United States of 8,326,957 common shares of the Company at a price of $1.25 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $10.41 million.
On August 21, 2019 the Company also completed or executed, as the case may be:

Results For The Three Months Ended November 30, 2019
The Company took significant steps to cut costs and reduce debt during calendar 2019. During the three months ended November 30, 2019, the Company realized a net gain of $0.55 million (November 30, 2018 - net loss of $5.64 million). General and administrative expenses during the period were $1.05 million (November 30, 2018 - $1.33 million), gains on foreign exchange were negligible at $7.0 thousand (November 30, 2018 - $1.20 million loss) primarily due to variance in the value of the United States Dollar relative to the parent company's functional currency of the Canadian Dollar, while stock based compensation expense, a non-cash item, totalled $0.24 million (November 30, 2018 - $0.02 million). Interest costs of $1.35 million were lower in the current period (November 30, 2018 - $2.47 million) due to lower debt levels. A gain on fair value of financial instruments of $3.13 million was recognized in the current period (November 30, 2018 - $2.27 million loss) due predominantly to a decrease in the value of unexercised $1.70 common share purchase warrants that expired on November 22, 2019.
At November 30, 2019 finance income consisting of interest earned and property rental fees amounted to $0.06 million (November 30, 2018 - $0.3 million). The basic and diluted gain per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 totalled $0.01 as compared to a loss of $0.19 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Accounts receivable at November 30, 2019 totalled $0.29 million (November 30, 2018 - $0.24 million) while accounts payable and accrued liabilities amounted to $1.55 million (November 30, 2018 - $4.20 million). Accounts receivable were comprised of mainly of amounts receivable for value added taxes repayable to the Company in South Africa. Accounts payable consisted primarily of engineering fees, accrued professional fees and regular trade payables.
Total expenditures on the Waterberg Project, before partner reimbursements, for three months ended November 30, 2019 were approximately $1.0 million (November 30, 2018 - $3.0 million). At period end, $39.2 million in accumulated net costs had been capitalized to the Waterberg Project. Total expenditures on the property since inception to November 30, 2019 are approximately $71.2 million.
For more information on mineral properties, see Note 3 of the Financial Statements.
The Company achieved several important business objectives during the past calendar year, including the repayment of a significant portion of the Company's secured debt and the completion and approval of the Waterberg DFS. The positive results of the Waterberg DFS provide a solid base for the assessment of value for the Waterberg Project in 2020. Subsequent to Waterberg JV Co. shareholders approving the Waterberg DFS on December 5, 2019, Implats may elect to exercise their Purchase and Development Option within 90 business days. The Waterberg DFS project schedule anticipates the grant of a mining right and the start of project engineering in calendar Q1 2020.
The Company's key business objective is to advance the palladium dominant Waterberg Project to a development and construction decision. An interim implementation budget of Rand 22.9 million (approximately $1.6 million at November 30, 2019) was approved by Waterberg JV Co. at a meeting of its Board of Directors on September 3, 2019. At present, the Company continues to work on advancing project permitting, infrastructure servitudes and community relationships with its joint venture partners through a technical committee of Waterberg JV Co. Concentrate offtake negotiations with Implats are currently in process, along with other offtake possibilities being considered, subject to Implats' right to match.
The spot metal basket price per 4E ounce for the Waterberg Project has increased by an aggregate of approximately 25% since spot prices for the DFS were measured on September 4, 2019. The market outlook for strong palladium demand and the potential for continued palladium supply deficits indicates a bright future for Waterberg's dominant metal.

Estimates of mineralization and other technical information included herein have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. The definitions of proven and probable reserves used in NI 43-101 differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the mineralization can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the "reserve" determination is made. As a result, the reserves reported by the Company in accordance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as "reserves" under SEC Industry Guide 7. In addition, the terms "mineral resource", "measured mineral resource", "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and historically have not been permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC pursuant to SEC Industry Guide 7. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. In particular, "inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an "inferred mineral resource" will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Disclosure of "contained ounces" in a resource is permitted disclosure under NI 43-101; however, SEC Industry Guide 7 normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute "reserves" by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, descriptions of the Company's mineral deposits in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7.
