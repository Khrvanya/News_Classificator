Like other metals, platinum’s start to the year was a little grim, entering 2016 at $890 an ounce. However, it’s picked up significantly since then, increasing $226.00 overall to $1,082 as of July 6 at 3:09 p.m. EST.
Like other metals, platinum’s start to the year was a little grim, entering 2016 at $890 an ounce. However, it’s picked up significantly since then, increasing $226.00 overall to $1,082 as of July 6 at 3:09 p.m. EST.
F ocusEconomics states in its June 2016 report that platinum prices have been rising throughout the year due to a weaker US dollar and expectations of a supply deficit. The company writes that China is the principal market for platinum jewelry, but reports are suggesting that Chinese demand for platinum will slow in 2016, sending prices back down.
However, that doesn’t mean all hope is lost for platinum. FocusEconomics also writes that prices are expected to stay relatively stable before picking up significantly more in 2017. Analysts surveyed see prices gradually rising to $1,125 an ounce by the fourth quarter in 2017.
That being said, a number of platinum mining companies have seen their stocks rise this year. Here’s a look at some of the top platinum stocks up over 130 percent at the halfway mark of the year, with a market capitalization minimum of $10 million.
