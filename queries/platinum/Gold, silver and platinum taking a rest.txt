Like Monday, gold , silver and platinum are churning around the mean, all slightly lower.  Looking back at Mondayâ€™s trade, gold spent the day on both sides of unchanged,  while silver was higher all day but off the highs and platinum was down early  and rallied hard late.
The metals  continue to be strong and appear to be taking a rest before the next move  higher. The current patterns suggest the rally will continue across the board  as they rotate strength from one to the other.
Silver is the  strongest, making new nine-month highs on Monday. The $19.75 level is now in  sight, and it would be no surprise to see new yearly highs. Gold and platinum  are in similar patterns but at different stages. Gold looks ready to pop and  make another run at the $1,800 level in the August futures. Platinum looks  poised for a run at $1,000 although still in consolidation. We remain long  across the board and see no reason to believe that will change any time soon.
We are now  offering a comprehensive commodity report that complements our other services.  The Technomental Commodity Report comes out on Wednesday evenings and provides  comprehensive fundamental and technical coverage of most commodities that trade  on the futures markets in the U.S. and U.K., as well as stocks, bonds and  digital currencies. There is a summary report on Friday after the markets  close, and robust quarterly reports on each of the six commodity sectors and a  general overview that recaps the past three months and offers projections and  suggestions for the next quarter. Andy Hecht, the author of the report, has  been a commodity trader since the early 1980s and has vast experience in  markets across all asset classes.
