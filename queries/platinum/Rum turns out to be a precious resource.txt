Hallival and Askival on the Isle of Rum, formed by a 60 million-year-old supervolcano
Evidence of platinum under a 60 million-year-old Scottish volcano has been discovered by scientists.
The precious metal, ten times rarer than gold, was discovered on the Isle of Rum in northwest Scotland.
Research by scientists at Keele University, the University of Manchester and University College Dublin, revealed there were high concentrations of platinum-group metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium at the Rum Volcanic Intrusion.
The team discovered that the metals were formed by small amounts of magma being repeatedly ejected during a volcanic eruption millions of years ago. The magma formed a “mushy” substance which held the precious metals after cooling down.
This contrasts with traditional scientific belief that the metals form in large-volume magma chambers over millions of years.
