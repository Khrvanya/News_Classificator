Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Platinum-Resistant Urothelial Carcinoma: Efficacy, Safety, and Biomarker Analyses with Extended Follow-Up from CheckMate 275 - Expert Commentary
Nivolumab is an FDA-approved immune checkpoint for treating platinum-resistant metastatic or surgically unresectable urothelial carcinoma (mUC). The development of predictive biomarkers to predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors have been challenging.
A recent study published by Galsky et al. in Clinical Cancer Research evaluated the long-term outcomes of platinum-resistant mUC patients treated with nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every two weeks in the Phase II CheckMate 275 trial. The investigators assessed the efficacy through the primary endpoint: objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoints: median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
The ORR was 20.7% (16.1-26.1), median PFS was 1.9 months (1.9-2.3), and median OS was 8.6 months (6.1-11.3, [95% CI]) in all treated patients. TMB positively correlated with ORR (odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 2.13 [1.26–3.60], P < 0.05), PFS (hazard ratio [HR] [95% CI]: 0.75 [0.61–0.92], P < 0.05), and OS (HR [95% CI]: 0.73 [0.58– 0.91], P < 0.05). The investigators showed that mutational signature 2 associated with APOBEC correlated with TMB. Patients with PD-L1 expression <1% had a shorter median OS of 6.0 months compared to patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% who had a median OS of 11.9 months. Interestingly, the combination of TMB and PD-L1 status was a better predictor of OS than PD-L1 alone (P = 0.013). There was no significant interaction between TMB and PD-L1 expression (P = 0.98).
Different tumor types respond differently to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This study highlights the importance of considering TMB, and PDL1 as predictors of response to nivolumab in bladder cancer patients.
