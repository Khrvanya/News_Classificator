Gold printed  a new high overnight and has pulled back to Monday’s levels. The high in the  June futures was $1,785 Monday night around 11 p.m. EDT. Gold since has pulled  back, trading as low as $1,758. Our first target of $1,790-$1,800 in the June  futures is in play, which includes a run over $1,800.
Silver and platinum are charging higher this morning, with July silver futures trading at  $16.25, around the high of the overnight trade. July platinum is breaking out  with July futures trading $791 on the way to $800. Silver and platinum remain  strong and could reach our targets today.
The metals  all look strong and are showing no sign of weakness. The patterns are powerful,  and we see no issue in reaching our first objectives. We know that things can  change at a moment’s notice, but based on what we can see now, we expect the  rally across the board to continue. We remain long and look for the new highs  to continue.
