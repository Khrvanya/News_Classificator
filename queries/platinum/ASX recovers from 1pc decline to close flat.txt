ASX200 falls 87 points after Iran missile strike, then recovers
Gold spikes in Aussie dollars, hits $2300 for first time in 8 months
That is all from us today.
Thank you for your time and your comments.
We will be back tomorrow.
Today's final closing price hides the dramatic changes on the stock market today. The S&P/ASX 200 shed 76 points, or 1 per cent, in the first three hours following news of an Iranian missile strike on US and Iraqi airbases in Iraq. FNearly everything but gold and oil stocks were down in a replay of Monday's market.
However, the ASX gradually recovered nearly all of the losses to close just 9 points lower at 6817.6. The difference between opening and closing price was just -0.1 per cent. By the final close only 132 companies were in red.
The healthcare and energy sectors added the most points, thanks to gains in oil producers and a 0.9 per cent rise in CSL to $285.85.  Communications increased 0.6 per cent due to a 0.8 per cent rise in Telstra shares to $3.74, and materials gained 0.2 per cent as gains in gold and lithium miners, and building product suppliers outweighed declines in iron ore miners. Aluminum miners fell as the aluminum price dropped 0.9 per cent on Wednesday.
The financials sector took away the most points with a fall of 0.5 per cent as all but one (QBE Insurance) of the stocks softened. And information technology dropped 1.2 per cent with falls of at least 3 per cent in WiseTech Global and Appen, and falls of 2.4 per cent in NextDC and nearmap.
The ASX hasn't managed to break into positive territory yet, but has held onto the afternoon recovery. IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda says markets were "sent into a spin" when news broke during our opening that that Iran attacked two US military bases in Iraq.
"Oil prices climbed by as much as 5 per cent, as traders took a punt on the heightened risk of supply and production disruptions in the region,'' he says.
"Gold prices continued to act as the safe haven du jour, touching the $US1600 mark – a new seven year high. Equities in the Asian were pummelled, as were US Futures, but have since performed a “V” shaped rebound. In all: it’s been a volatile day. Don’t you just love holiday trading conditions?"
The ASX continues to improve into the final hour of trading, with the S&P/ASX 200 now just 5 points below Tuesday's closing price at 6819.7 points.  The All Ords is down 10 points at 6933.3, up grom a low of 6867 at 11.40am.
Six of eleven sectors are still in red with the worst performer being information technology, down 0.9 per cent. Financials are down 0.6 per cent, which is weighing heavily on the index. Only two companies in the financial index are higher this afternoon - QBE Insurance and Credit Corp.
The communications sector is up 1 per cent thanks to a 1.2 per cent rise in Telstra shares to $3.76. Telstra is actually up 6 per cent since the start of 2020 compared to a broader market rise of 2 per cent.
The Australian dollar dropped down to US68.50¢ earlier today, but has risen up to an intra-day high of US68.84¢ following better than expected building approvals data. Gold is still higher at $2313 per ounce, or $US1590.9
Are Boomers slowing the economy?
As the Reserve Bank’s cash rate halved through 2019, Australia officially entered the ultra-low rate void that most of the developed world experienced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and in which much of the developed world remains trapped today. The challenge for policymakers is to find an exit path.
There may not be one. The one economy that appeared to be on the path towards more normal rate and growth settings, the US, was forced to backtrack at the start of 2019, when the Federal Reserve Board’s cautious rate hikes and the shrinking of a balance sheet swollen by its bond and mortgage purchases during the crisis years sparked an implosion in financial markets.
A decade after the nadir of the crisis appeared to pass in March 2019, policymakers (dominated by the major central banks) are at a loss to explain why the unprecedented actions they have taken have produced such meagre returns or to outline a path towards growth settings that might be regarded as more normal than those now being experienced.
There was a surprise jump in building approvals in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, rising 11.8 per cent compared to October. However, approvals in November were still down -3.8 per cent compared to November 2018.
Apartment approvals increased 22.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, while house approvals increased 6.1 per cent.
However, the seasonally adjusted estimate of the value of building approvals dropped 6.5 per cent.
"The value of residential building rose 5.2 per cent, while the value of non-residential building fell 20.7 per cent,'' the Bureau of Statistics reported.
The S&P/ASX 200 has climbed from 6749 points up to 6819 points in the past 90 minutes, a gain of 70 points, and is now close to breaking into positive territory. There are 66 companies in green, up from just 20 earlier this morning.
CSL is now 0.8 per cent higher rising from $279.02 earlier today up to $285.62.  Similarly BHP has climbed up from $39.03 at 11.40am up to $39.56.
Telstra is now up nearly 1 per cent to $3.74 and Ansell is up 2.4 per cent to $30.77.
However, Qantas' decline has extended to 4 per cent and the big banks are still lower. Technology stocks remain under pressure with Xero down 2.1 per cent.
We've gotten hold of the Credit Suisse research note on listed fund managers which downgraded Platinum Asset Management and Pendal Group.  In response Pendal shares are down 5.2 per cent to $8.56 and Platinum shares are down 3.3 per cent to $4.39.
Magellan Financial Group has an existing Underperform rating because of its high share price, which increased 135 per cent in 2019. While inflows remain 'robust' and funds are outperforming, Magellan shares are about 30 per cent more expensive than its peers and ''any little hiccup could trigger a derating''.
Meanwhile the outlook for Platinum is pessimistic.
"We forecast earnings to be broadly flat between 2018-19 and 2021-22 estimates, a disappointing outcome for a business that should be naturally supported by equity market growth,'' the diversified financials analyst team wrote in a note to clients.
"We expect earnings growth will be constrained by weak fund performance (weighing on flows or performance fees) and ongoing fund distributions. With downside risk to our forecasts on flows (which we have improving) and Platinum already trading on 17.4 (times earnings), we shift to an Underperform rating (from Neutral).''
Analyst James Cordukes has reduced his estimates for Platinum's earnings in 2021-22 by 20 per cent to 26¢ due to expectations of lower flows.
And Pendal group has been downgraded because of concerns about Pendal's overseas subsidiary J O Hambro Capital Management.
"We expect 2019-20 to be a challenging year for Pendal, with industry data already indicating that Pendal has received outflows in the Hambro retail franchise in October and November. Without sustained recovery in fund performance, we see downside risk to our outer-year forecasts.''
Bond and equity markets have improved in the past hour as sentiment improves following Iran's missile strike on two Iraqi army bases.
The S&P/ASX 200 is currently at 6782 points, down -0.6 per cent, which is an improvement from the -1 per cent decline to 6750 just before midday.  Gold prices jumped $US40 to a high of $US1612 about two hours ago, but are now back down to $US1590.
Similarly, a rush to government bonds has eased. The Australian Government 10 year bond yield was 1.18 per cent before the missile strike, then fell to 1.13 per cent. It is currently around 1.15 per cent.
“When treasury bond prices spike it tells you that investors are rushing into safe haven assets such as government bonds,'' says Asmita Kulkarni, a director of the Investment Strategy Group at FIIG securities.
There were reports that US President Donald Trump would make a statement this evening, Washington DC time, but White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham says he has no plans to make a statement.
The S&P/ASX 200 has nearly wiped away Tuesday's gains and is repeating Monday's performance with gold and oil stocks adding points.
"Yesterday was our best day for the year and looks like today is our worst one of the year,'' Bell Direct market analyst Jessica Amir said.
There are just 20 stocks higher than yesterday and 178 are lower. The big four banks are down by more than 1 per cent today and Qantas has fallen 3.5 per cent to $6.85 on expectations of higher oil prices.
