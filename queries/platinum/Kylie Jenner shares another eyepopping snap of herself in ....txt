When your underwear drawer needs a revamp it’s easy to reach for the florals or animal print patterns but why not opt for a sexier style this season?
Take Kylie Jenner as inspiration, who we spotted showing off this lingerie set by Gucci. Yes, that’s right, they don’t just do desirable bags and bold knitwear.
Designed with a glamourous 50s silhouette, the set is crafted from black sheer mesh that’s monogrammed with the signature GG and finished with pale pink logo taping.
You will have to splash the cash at Farfetch (click right), but the investment is worth it considering you can wear it under an evening outfit or whilst chilling at home like Kylie.
However, if you want to get the look for less head to the carousel for cheaper look-alikes by I Saw It First, MISBHV and Pour Moi.
