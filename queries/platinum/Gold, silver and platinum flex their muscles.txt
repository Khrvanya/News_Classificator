One thing we  have learned the last couple of days is that there is underlying strength in  the metals. Gold, silver and platinum were all in danger this week at one time  or another, and all three managed to fend off the sellers and maintain their  bull markets.
Gold has been  under the most pressure for the last couple of weeks. There appears to be a big  seller that shows up once a day usually around 9 a.m. EDT. Gold takes a big hit  but has been able to recover and hold support. This does guarantee a run to the  recent highs, but based on the pattern, we are long looking for higher prices.
Silver and platinum have been almost identical in price action. The only difference this  week between the two is silver is higher for the week while platinum is  slightly lower. The patterns are good and indicate the rally is not over.
Gold and platinum are lower for the week but still in solid consolidation patterns with  an upward bias. Silver is up for the week but also in consolidation. We have no  reason to believe the rally will not continue.
