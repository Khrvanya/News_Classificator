When a company announces a recall, market withdrawal, or safety alert, the FDA posts the company's announcement as a public service. FDA does not endorse either the product or the company.
Motto International Corp. is voluntarily recalling all lots of Bull Platinum 30000, Stallion Platinum 30000, Rhino 7 Platinum 30000, and Panther Platinum 30000, to the consumer level. FDA analysis has found Bull Platinum 30000, Stallion Platinum 30000, Rhino 7 Platinum 30000, and Panther Platinum 30000 to be tainted with undeclared tadalafil. Tadalafil is an FDA approved drug indicated for the treatment of male sexual enhancement. The presence of tadalafil in these products renders them unapproved drugs for which safety and efficacy has not been established and, therefore, subject to recall.
Consumption of a product with undeclared tadalafil may pose a risk to consumers who take prescription medications containing nitrates (such as nitroglycerin). The combination of tadalafil and nitrates may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels which can be life threatening. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates and may be the population most likely to be affected. To date, Motto International Corp. has not received any reports of adverse events related to this recall.
