Gold prices were little changed on Friday as worries over an accelerating number of coronavirus cases countered a fillip to risk sentiment from positive U.S. and Chinese economic data.
Spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1,775.06 per ounce by 1:40 p.m EDT (1740 GMT). Most U.S. markets are closed on Friday ahead of Independence Day on July 4.
U.S. gold futures edged down 0.2% to $1,787.30 per ounce.
"Central bank easing policies and uncertainty surrounding the second wave (of COVID-19) are sustaining gold prices," Bank of China International analyst Xiao Fu said, adding that despite a positive U.S. jobs report, more data was needed to suggest the economy was on a strong footing.
Gold will likely trade in a tight range, but remains well supported above $1,750 an ounce, Xiao Fu said.
Cases of coronavirus continued to increase globally, with more than 10.94 million people infected, while the United States reported a new daily global record number of cases.
"Geopolitical considerations are also to the fore," said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA. "With a holiday in the United States, and the weekend upon us, some haven-directed buying of gold is definitely evident."
Escalating political tensions, more than 75 members of the U.S. Congress sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to make a formal determination on whether China's treatment of Muslim Uighurs and other groups constituted an atrocity.
Indicative of sentiment, holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust GLD , rose 0.8% to 1,191.47 tonnes on Thursday.
But stemming gains in bullion, data showing a recovery in China's services sector and a record addition of jobs to the U.S. economy in June helped world shares hover near a four-month high.
Palladium rose 0.4% to $1,909.27 per ounce, while platinum climbed 0.8% to $809 per ounce, set for its first weekly gain in six.
Silver gained 1% to $18.07 per ounce, heading for its fourth consecutive weekly gain.
