No, Bayonetta 3 hasn't been cancelled, insists Platinum's Hideki Kamiya
I have good news, Bayonetta fans. Despite the radio silence since the Nintendo Switch-exclusive third instalment of the bewitching franchise was revealed in 2017 , developer Platinum Games' insists the game is still in development.
"I'm on Twitter so I see a lot of comments every day," Kamiya told our pals at VGC . "I'm happy that there's still anticipation for the title, but one thing I would like to address is the trend I'm seeing which is people who are starting to ask if the game has been cancelled.
"I want you guys to take any concerns you have like that and throw them out the window immediately because we're still hard at work on it and it hasn't been cancelled by any means. Please look forward to it!"
So while there's still no clue on when we might finally be able to lay our hands on Bayonetta 3, don't panic - it definitely hasn't been cancelled.
In related news, Platinum Games recently delayed the physical release of its spruced-up superhero action romp The Wonderful 101: Remastered due to shipping and distribution issues relating to the coronavirus. The digital release, however, went ahead as originally planned, and was available to download on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC on 19th May in North America, and on 22nd May in Europe.
The crowdfunding campaign for Platinum Games' The Wonderful 101: Remastered finished up its £38,000 ($50K) Kickstarter with a grand total of ¥235,320,528 - that's a whopping £1.7 million ($2.2m). The Kickstarter campaign was so successful, it smashed its £1.16 million ($1.5m) stretch goal within hours, prompting Platinum Games to add even more goals early in the campaign.
