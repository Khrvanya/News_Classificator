A randomized, phase 3 trial was designed to assess avelumab (anti–PD-L1) as maintenance therapy following response or stable disease with 1L platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). Researchers randomized eligible patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic UC without disease progression after 4-6 cycles of gemcitabine with either cisplatin or carboplatin in 1:1 ratio to receive maintenance avelumab (10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) + best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone, stratified by best response to 1L chemotherapy (complete/partial response vs stable disease) and by visceral vs nonvisceral disease when initiating 1L chemotherapy. They randomized 700 patients to maintenance avelumab + BSC (n=350) or BSC alone (n=350) and were followed for a median of 19.6 and 19.2 months, respectively. The data showed that in all randomized patients and patients with PD-L1+ tumors, JAVELIN Bladder 100 met its primary objective, indicating significantly prolonged OS with 1L maintenance avelumab + BSC vs BSC alone in advanced UC. They found efficacy benefits across all prespecified subgroups, and the safety profile of avelumab was consistent with previous studies of monotherapy.
