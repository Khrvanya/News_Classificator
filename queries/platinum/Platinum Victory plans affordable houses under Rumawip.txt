KUALA LUMPUR: Property developer Platinum Victory Group will launch a project under the Federal Territory's affordable housing scheme or Rumawip in Setapak here.
The Vista Danau Kota development is part of the company's focus on meeting Malaysia's national agenda and increasing market demand for affordable homes.
Vista Danau Kota is set within 3.72 acres and will be launched on July 4.
It is a one-block development comprising 910 units priced at RM300,000 each.
"As a seasoned property developer in the industry for over two decades, Platinum Victory understands the market needs, without compromising the fundamental elements that most consumers look for in a property: location, value for money, convenience and accessibility.
"In this regard, Vista Danau Kota checks these boxes and at the same time, makes the most of the space allotted for a practical living," said executive director Gan Yee Hin.
Gan said the houses will be equipped with lifestyle facilities such as swimming pools for adults and kids, a multipurpose hall, laundry room, surau, community space, nursery, shop lots and 24-hour security.
"This is a value-added benefit many may not be aware of, as the perception of affordable homes is that they tend to be in far flung locations," he said.
Gan said it has other upcoming projects that cater to homebuyers under Platinum Victory's Vista Essential Homes segment.
