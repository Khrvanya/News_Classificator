The metals markets have been as ugly as they can get without breaking  down. For the last week or two, major support levels have been holding but the  pattern could be changing, which could lead to a big sell-off. We have not  reversed and remain long but understand that the risk to the downside has  increased.
Gold is back at $1,700 this morning based on the June futures, and  it looks like a little short covering. However, the big picture shows us either  a forced liquidation or margin selling. Almost every day, a big seller shows up  for a few minutes, hammers gold and then goes away until the next day. That is  a major concern, but the buyers have defended support, which brings the  question: who will win this battle?
Silver and platinum look almost identical, both turning in bearish  action with just enough buyers to defend the support line. Silver and platinum  are in an ugly pattern, which has a high probability of breaking down. However,  we will stay long until the pattern confirms a reversal.
The bottom line is simple â€“ our algorithms are long, which is all  we care about. When trading anything, emotions should not be a part of the  decision-making process unless you like being on the wrong side of the market.  All trading decisions should be made on a mechanical basis with no regard for  news or opinions.
