The platinum Copper alloy is a platinum-based binary alloy containing copper. It is a continuous solid solution at high temperatures. At low temperatures, there is an orderly transition in the range of 3% to 93% copper composition, and the phase structure changes from cubic lattice to the rhombohedral lattice, which significantly enhances the alloys PtCu2.5, PtCu5, PtCu8.5, PtCu15, and PtCu25 alloy.
The global Platinum Copper Alloy market is valued at US$ xx million in 2020 is expected to reach US$ xx million by the end of 2026, growing at a CAGR of xx% during 2021-2026.
