Tuesday gold closed at its highest levels since September 2012. As we have been  writing, gold appears to be ready to make a run at the all-time highs. Although  there have been some scary moments in this rally, gold has maintained a solid  uptrend.
This  morning gold is above 1800 August futures and should make a run at the highs. However,  a pullback in the next couple of days would be no surprise and probably healthy  to continue to drive the rally. $1,780 is solid support for August futures.
Silver is  joining gold and should take out May highs. With the current price action, we  expect silver to take out 2016 highs with an opportunity to go to $25. Silver  is breaking out, but a failure from here would not be detrimental to the  pattern and could be healthy.
Platinum has had a good couple of days of higher prices; however, the volume has been  extremely light, keeping the downtrend alive. The rally platinum appears to be  nothing more than a bounce within a bear market.
Our  positions remain the same long gold, silver, and short platinum. The current  price action tells us thereâ€™s a lot more room to run to the upside in gold and  silver, downside platinum.
