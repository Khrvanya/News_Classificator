PlatinumGames has unveiled a new action game, Project GG, in the latest issue of Japanese magazine Famitsu.
Project GG will be Platinum’s first wholly owned IP and will be self-published, it told the publication (via ryokutya2089.com ).
Directed by Hideki Kamiya (Bayonetta), Project GG will star a giant hero who fights monsters.
[UPDATE: PlatinumGames has officially announced Project G.G. with a trailer and letter from director Hideki Kamiya.]
Platinum has established a new Tokyo studio to work on the title, with the current team of around 15 people looking to expand to closer to 100.
Platinum said in January it had received investment from Tencent which would see the Japanese studio remain independent while allowing it to explore self-publishing. The studio told Famitsu it declined the opportunity for Tencent to publish Project GG.
Project GG is the second game to be revealed as part of Platinum’s 4 projects teaser campaign , following The Wonderful 101 Remastered earlier this month.
PlatinumGames has opened a new Tokyo studio.
The studio told Famitsu that the remaining two projects in the campaign are not ports, and that the final one is “a big secret.”
Platinum has made no secret of its ambition to move into self-publishing.
Studio head Atsushi Inaba told VGC in May 2019 that moving towards such a model would allow the company to own its own IP for the first time, offering it more control over how it plans its games.
At the time Inaba claimed Bayonetta 3 would see a change in design process based on experience creating the first two games, and revealed that the firm was midway through creating an unannounced title which he claimed “has never been done before”.
Platinum has two in-development original IPs, which will be owned entirely by the studio.
