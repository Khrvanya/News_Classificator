Investors who believe the above market dynamics will eventually result in the platinum price rising even more may be interested in investing in the metal. There are several ways to invest in platinum, with the first being to purchase physical platinum bars or platinum bullion coins directly as a way to expand one’s portfolio. Such purchases can be made through a bullion dealer.
Another investment option is the WPIC and BullionVault’s online physical platinum market, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It gives private individuals access to vaulted platinum for the same prices currently paid by institutional investors.
Those interested in physical platinum can also gain exposure via the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (ARCA: SPPP ). It provides access to the physical platinum bullion market while allowing the flexibility of an exchange-traded security. Exchange-traded funds are another way to invest in the platinum market, and the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (ARCA: PPLT ) is a sound option.
The final way to invest in platinum is, of course, to own shares of a platinum-mining company. Some of the top platinum companies by market cap include Anglo American Platinum (LSE: AAL ,OTCQX:AAUKF), Impala Platinum Holdings (OTC Pink: IMPUY ,JSE:IMP) and Tharisa (LSE: THS ). The benefit of investing in a flourishing mining company is that they have a higher chance of not being negatively affected by a dwindling platinum spot price.
