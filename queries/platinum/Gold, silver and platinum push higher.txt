The huge  rally in metals rolls on; there seems to be no stopping them. All three are in  the blow-off phase, and the buyers are suffering from FOMO (fear of missing  out). This pattern and the huge rallies will end; however, this has triggered a  buy signal, making us bullish in gold , silver and platinum .
We have been  bullish gold and platinum all the way up and have added silver to the fray. We  will be looking for a pullback to support levels to create additional buys.  Silver was the last to confirm an up move, and depending on how the patterns  develop, the possibility exists for a major bull market.
Looking into  the future, we would like to see a small pullback followed by an extended  period of consolidation. This type of action would be the best for a  bull-market run. If the metals continue at their current pace, they are doomed  to fail. Support levels are March silver futures, $18-$18.10; April gold  futures, $1,590-$1,595; and April platinum futures, $990-$995.
