Here we go  again. Gold has found a crucial level it must hold, while silver and platinum  failed at their resistance levels. Although the rallies in the metals have been  strong, they appear to be over and now they are all at major levels. The next  few days will tell the story on if they are in the next up leg or if the rallies  were just short covering before they resume the downtrend.
May silver futures resistance is $14.90, and failure to break above would create a lower  high, indicating that there is more selling to come. May platinum futures  resistance is $747, and failure to take out that high would result in the  downtrend continuing. Both are at key decision levels that will define the next  moves.
After peaking  Wednesday at $1,698, June gold finds itself under pressure and threatening to  resume the downtrend. If the $1,698 level holds, that would be a lower high and  a signal that gold is headed lower. We are uncomfortably long in gold, platinum  and silver and will stay there until our signal changes.
