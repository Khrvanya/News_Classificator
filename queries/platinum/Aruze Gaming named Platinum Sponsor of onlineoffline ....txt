For the first time, MAD5 will be both an online and offline event, with the gathering to be live streamed to viewers via the IAG facebook page. Those who are unable to attend in person are encouraged to join online where they will be hosted by IAG Managing Editor Ben Blaschke and can even interact with guests at Kam Pek Bar.
Located on the third floor of Kam Pek Paradise Casino, near Hotel Lisboa, Kam Pek Bar will provide a fun and vibrant venue in a prime location for MAD guests to let their hair down while enjoying free flow wine and beer plus snacks and networking with industry peers.
The venue is renowned for offering spectacular views over the buzzing nightlife of the Macau peninsula and live performances from the resident band.
MAD is a regular series of industry networking social events held in Asia’s gaming hub of Macau. Each MAD brings together key industry decision-makers with the people they want to meet in a relaxed and friendly environment. A new venue is chosen for each event.
Attendees of MAD must work for an operator (land-based or online), a supplier to an operator, a VIP promoter or be connected to the industry in some way. All attendees supply their business cards upon entrance. There is also a select VIP list for each event.
A number of other sponsorship opportunities are also available for MAD. To find out more about any of the sponsorship packages on offer, please contact Jadeson Ho on +853 2875 2959 or at jh@asgam.com.
