Global Platinum Iridium Alloy Market Report: Production, Revenue, Price Trend by Types & Market Analysis by Application
Platinum Iridium alloy is a platinum-based binary alloy containing Iridium. It is a continuous solid solution at high temperature. When it is slowly cooled to 975~700 °C, solid-phase decomposition occurs, but the phase equilibrium process proceeds very slowly. It is difficult to volatilize and oxidize, which can significantly improve the corrosion resistance of platinum.
The global Platinum Iridium Alloy market is valued at US$ xx million in 2020 is expected to reach US$ xx million by the end of 2026, growing at a CAGR of xx% during 2021-2026.
