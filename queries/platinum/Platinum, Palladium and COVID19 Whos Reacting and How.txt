“With respect to offtake agreements, deliveries from all parties to the smelter were suspended on 24 March 2020 to enable the smelting operations to prepare for an orderly shutdown,” reads its statement . “With respect to customer supply contracts, deliveries can resume once the force majeure is lifted, provided delivery logistics permit.”
Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) (LSE: AAL ,OTC Pink:AGPPF) — Mining major Amplats also has several operations in South Africa that have been impacted by the 21 day lockdown.
As of March 27 , Amplats was in the process of ramping down its underground mining operations as it moved its Amandelbult mine, the Modikwa joint venture and the Kroondal joint venture, as well as the Mortimer smelter and Waterval smelter, into care and maintenance.
In early March, an explosion at the Watervale smelter prompted the PGMs miner to issue a force majeure announcement of its own, noting that it would be unable to meet its previous guidance.
Repairs where already underway at both Phase A and Phase B of the smelter before the COVID-19 pandemic forced South Africa into lockdown.
Amplats expects the repairs to Phase B to be completed near the end of May. The company has committed to paying all employees and said it will be maintaining community ties and programs during the three week country closure.
Sibanye-Stillwater (NYSE: SBGL ) — Precious metals producer Sibanye-Stillwater also operates globally, with five PGMs projects in South Africa.
In compliance with the South African lockdown, Sibanye issued a press release on March 25 outlining plans to but both its PGMs and gold operations in the country on care and maintenance.
The company announcement goes on to note how the production halt could impact longer-term output.
Sibanye also has a webpage dedicated to COVID-19 updates and coverage.
