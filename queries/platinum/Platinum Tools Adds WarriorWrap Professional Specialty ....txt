“The  WarriorWrap line is extensive,” explained David Johny, Platinum Tools general  manager. “To start, we will focus on the three grades of electrical tape that  are the foundation of the program.”

The  Select family is for primary insulation applications and cable bundling, and  the General line is for temporary indoor environments and cable marking. All  three performance grades of Premium, Select and General vinyl electrical tape  are available in black and 11 popular colors.
The  WarriorWrap Specialty Tape line has been designed to outperform all other tapes  in the market today and is one of the most comprehensive in the industry,  satisfying every professional taping need for contractors and electricians. The  line offers 36 tapes including high-voltage and rubber linered and linerless  splicing tapes, mastic tapes, glass cloth tapes, corrosion protection tapes,  and tapes for harness wrapping, shielding, electrical filling, friction, and  fire-retardant arc proofing.
