Is The Card For You?
American Express offers several Delta SkyMiles credit cards. The Delta SkyMiles Platinum American Express Card, one of the premium options, offers quite a bit of value to frequent Delta Air Lines flyers.
This card is very helpful if you find yourself falling short of the next status level you want to achieve. It offers 40,000 bonus miles and 5,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) after meeting the minimum spending requirement. And each calendar year, after spending $25,000, you can earn 10,000 MQMs toward status, up to two times per year.
Every year you renew your card membership and pay the annual fee, you’ll receive a Delta Companion Certificate in your SkyMiles account—one of the best perks of this card. The certificate can be used to book a companion’s flight in the U.S. (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) for only the cost of taxes.
Only Main Cabin flights in certain fare classes qualify, which means you can’t fly in First Class, but you can still save a significant sum of money by booking two tickets for the price of one. If your goal is to fully offset the annual fee, you should book a flight that costs at least $250.
Earn 40,000 bonus miles and 5,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new Card in your first 3 months. Plus, earn a $100 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase with your new Card within your first 3 months.
Earn 3 Delta SkyMiles per dollar spent with Delta Air Lines and hotels when booking directly, 2 Delta miles per dollar spent at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar spent.
Save 20% on in-flight Delta purchases.
Check one bag for free for yourself and up to eight other passengers traveling on the same reservation.
Board a Delta plane in the Main Cabin 1 group.
Earn 40,000 bonus miles and 5,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) after you spend $2,000 in purchases on your new Card in your first 3 months. Plus, earn a $100 statement credit after you make a Delta purchase with your new Card within your first 3 months. After that, you’ll earn 3 SkyMiles per dollar spent on Delta Air Lines purchases and hotels (when booking directly) and 2 SkyMiles per dollar spent at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets. All other purchases earn 1 mile per dollar. There’s no limit to how many miles you can earn in a calendar year.
You will earn 2 additional miles on top of the 2 miles you already earn (for a total of 4 miles) from American Express for each dollar of eligible purchases charged on your Delta SkyMiles Platinum Card at supermarkets located in the U.S. (superstores and warehouse clubs are not considered supermarkets) from May 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020.
You will also earn 10,000 bonus MQMs toward elite status after spending $25,000 on your card within a calendar year (up to twice per year). In other words, spending $50,000 on the card will earn you 20,000 MQMs total.
Delta’s loyalty program isn’t the most user-friendly when it comes time to redeem miles. SkyMiles no longer publishes award charts on its website.The dynamic pricing model makes it hard to find great value in the program by increasing redemption rates with demand.
One of the best opportunities to redeem SkyMiles is through SkyMiles Deals . You’ll find that redemption rates are lower than usual to particular destinations during these sales. In the past, we’ve seen sales to Australia, the Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii.
Delta is a member of the SkyTeam alliance, so you can redeem SkyMiles to book award seats on itineraries operated by other SkyTeam members including Aeroflot, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Aeroméxico, Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, KLM, Korean Air, Vietnam Airlines and more.
Other less-valuable ways to use SkyMiles include Pay with Miles and enrolling in Delta Sky Club membership. These are not recommended because the value per mile is reduced to just 1 cent, which is below the value you can get when redeeming for flights.
To determine the rewards potential of the Delta SkyMiles Platinum American Express card we have to look at the bonus categories and calculate what the typical American household might spend in those areas. Forbes uses data from various government agencies in order to determine both baseline income and spending averages across various categories. The 70th percentile of wage earners bring in $100,172 annually and we base spending on that number.
The Delta SkyMiles Platinum card has the following spending categories:
Forbes calculates that the typical household spends $10,093 on restaurants and groceries, which adds up to 20,186 SkyMiles.  Spending $1,755 on airfare would translate to 5,265 SkyMiles, and $14,562 on other purchases that could reasonably be charged to a credit card would earn 14,562 SkyMiles. This means that the card would earn a total of 40,373 points per year in addition to the welcome bonus earned during the first year only.
On top of the SkyMiles earned, the cardholder would benefit from an annual companion certificate for a Delta flight. This assumes the certificate actually gets used because if it isn’t used it has no value at all.
Free checked bag for you and up to eight companions traveling on the same reservation.
20% savings on in-flight purchases such as meals, alcoholic drinks or entertainment
Balance transfer fee: Either $5 or 3% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater.
Cash advance fee: Either $10 or 5% of the amount of each cash advance, whichever is greater.
American Express and Delta offer multiple credit card options for both consumers and small businesses. As a consumer, you have four choices: the Delta SkyMiles® Blue American Express Card , the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card , the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card and the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card .
The Platinum version of the card isn’t quite as premium as the Delta Reserve Credit Card, but it’s certainly a step-up from its sibling Blue and Gold Delta SkyMiles cards. Its annual fee of $250 weeds out most of the casual Delta flyers, yet it isn’t too high to scare off a frequent traveler who’ll use the benefits. Redeeming the Companion Certificate every year you hold the card helps offset the annual fee.
If you’re looking to save on the annual fee and want some of the benefits of the Delta SkyMiles Platinum card, but aren’t sure that you’ll use the companion certificate, take a hard look at the $99 annual fee (waived the first year) (see rates and fees ) Delta SkyMiles Gold Card.
Meanwhile, the Delta SkyMiles Reserve American Express Card is for those who prefer visiting Sky Clubs on their many trips with Delta Air Lines. The card offers Delta Sky Club membership (worth $545 annually) to passengers looking for comfortable airport experience. Holding the premium Delta card isn’t cheap ($550 (see rates and fees ), but Sky Club individual membership alone is enough to wipe out the annual fee. In addition, you also receive a Companion Certificate every year good for a domestic Delta flight.
