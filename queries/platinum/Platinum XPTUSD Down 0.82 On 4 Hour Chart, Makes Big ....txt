@MuhammedAsaeed @Taahir_Joosub i don’t really play in that small cap space as it can take you years before you see any rewards.. (they have gone nowhere over the last decade) – look at an implats or a northams if you want to see some shorter term rewards from a spike in the platinum price
@Worldcrickchamp Wcc3 These games are just for rich people,because you turn them on a net. Play career mode You have kept his platinum price so that it will take more than 3months to achieve this.And if the man opens up with money, how much more are he charging?How will poor play
@Juandredup1 @EasyEquities I anticpate that the platinum price will increase and wanted to invest in a platinum miner/producer. Northam seems, in my opinion, to be the best of the bunch listed on the JSE.
