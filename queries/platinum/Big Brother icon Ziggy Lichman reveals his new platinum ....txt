Ziggy's latest look comes as his former flame Chanelle said Ziggy is the only housemate that she still speaks to.
In 2007, the pair shared a steamy clinch in the shower on the show and later admitted they did have sex.
While their romance only lasted six months, she told The Sun: 'Yeah, we’ll chat every now and again. I don’t talk to anybody else from the show really.’
In 2018, Ziggy appeared on Loose Women and said: 'I have no doubt we were in love'.
Chanelle added: 'I don't think even we knew if we were on or off. We had people in our ears pushing us together, plotting to split us up.'
Ziggy said: 'I still love her to bits, absolutely.'
Chanelle is now a mother to two sons, Blakely, nine, with footballer Matthew Bates, and two-year-old son Frankie with ex boyfriend Ryan Oates. She is now single.
Ziggy is now the owner/founder of The Shop NW10, a pan-Asian inspired restaurant and bar in Kensal Rise, where he has worked since 2018.
