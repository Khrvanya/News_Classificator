Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists.
The conspiracy theorists were out in force yesterday and should  continue harping away this morning. What else could explain a 50% retracement  in gold over the last couple of weeks? From a technical view, gold is now at  must-hold support; if the $1,650 level in the June futures fails, the trend  will reverse from long to short.
Silver has been weaker than gold but also finds itself at a  must-hold level of $14.80 in the July futures. Silver finds itself at the  bottom end of congestion, which should create a bounce and reverse the trend.  However, we do not change until the technical levels confirm.
Platinum looks the best of the group although it is still in  congestion. Platinum is in a wide trading range of $750-$850 in the July  futures and can go either way from here.
Wherever the metals go from here, they are still in bullish  formations, which has a chance to change by day’s end. We have been long and  have large profits across the board. We don’t expect a change. We expect a  bounce but are prepared to reverse if that’s what the market footprint tells us  to do.
