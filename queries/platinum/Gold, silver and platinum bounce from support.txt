The  turbulence in the metals continues. They have become very volatile trying to  decide if the trend is going to change. For now, the trend remains up and until  that changes, we will stay long in gold, silver and platinum. Trend trading is  about having the ability to trade the footprint not the emotions that are  brought on by violent movement.
Gold appeared  to have some forced liquidation the last week or two; however, the seller  seemed to have be out on Thursday. Volume in gold has been light, which  indicates that the bullish trend remains in place. The key levels to watch on  the downside are $1,680-$1,700 in the June futures.
Silver and platinum are weaker than gold but remain in uptrends and have similar  characteristics â€“ light volume, big price movement and volatility. As long as  they can hold support levels, the trend remains higher. The support levels to  watch are $14.30-$14.50 in July silver and $730-$750 in July platinum. Until  support breaks down, we will stay long.
