Buy Setups Emerging For Gold, Silver, and Platinum
We have a solid reward to risk “trading” setup in Gold, Silver, and Platinum futures.
All three metals have recently retested their Money Flow Unit (MFU) target area, creating long opportunities with a stop just below the recent low (for traders).
Should this area hold, it would likely produce a nice trading bounce. But any trades taken will be kept on a tight leash.
Upside price targets will be generated once we have daily bullish MFU targets (should these levels hold). Charts are annotated and simply my short-term trading opinions.
