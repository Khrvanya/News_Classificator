The TSX/TSXV-listed junior palladium stocks weâ€™ve excavated have rallied on average ~65% year to date, and could benefit from the expected increased demand for palladium from the automotive industry
SmallCapPower | January 22, 2020: The palladium price has rallied since late August 2019, when it broke the US$1,500/oz price level. Since August 2019, palladium has climbed ~48%, and ~18.5% in the past month to ~$2230/oz. Much of the expected demand for palladium is supposed to come from the expected increase in hybrid cars, which required the precious metal to control pollution, as governments begin to impose tougher regulations on carbon emissions. The market share of hybrid cars was just 3% in 2016; this is expected to increase to 20% by 2025. As such, palladium use by the automotive industry is expected to more than quadruple in the same time. Today we have found five junior palladium stocks poised to benefit from the surge in demand for palladium.
