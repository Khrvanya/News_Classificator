Marvel's Iron Man VR is flying into view in just a few days, and it seems like a promising superhero adventure for PlayStation VR fans. With release just around the corner, you may be wondering what the Trophy list might look like. The good news is, the list of trinkets has made its way online. The other good news is that it shouldn't be too hard to grab the Platinum.
Looking at the list over on PSNProfiles , it appears as though the majority of Trophies will pop as you play through the story missions. There are some others; you'll need to beat the game on each difficulty setting, and there are some extracurricular tasks like catching a grape in your mouth or earning a basketball high score. There are also flight and combat challenges you'll need to conquer before the Plat can be added to your digital cabinet.
All in all, it's a very straightforward Trophy set. This follows similar patterns in other first party games from Sony; games like Marvel's Spider-Man , God of War , and The Last of Us: Part II also have relatively simple Trophy lists.
