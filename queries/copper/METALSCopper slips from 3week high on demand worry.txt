SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - Copper prices retreated on Wednesday from a near three-week high hit in the previous session, as the spreading new coronavirus pandemic continued to dampen demand outlook for the metal.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) declined 0.8% to $4,998.50 a tonne by 0156 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) fell 0.4% to 40,470 yuan ($5,727.18) a tonne.
Earlier this week, investors took solace from signs of a slowdown in virus death tolls in hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain.
But sentiment took a hit again when Spain reported higher deaths cases for the first time in five days on Tuesday and the U.S. state of New York saw its single-highest daily loss of life.
Meanwhile, France became the fourth country to register more than 10,000 deaths from the virus.
