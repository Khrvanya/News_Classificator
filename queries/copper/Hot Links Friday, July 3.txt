Nothing official from the league itself yet, but the MSM have all but confirmed that Edmonton and Toronto will be the NHL’s two Hub Cities, with Edmonton tipped to host both Conference Finals and the Stanley Cup Finals at Rogers Place.
With Edmonton and Toronto being chosen as the two NHL Hub cities, the question most often asked now is, which of the two will play host to the Stanley Cup final and Conference finals?

As a follow up on the perils of play-by-play pandemic reporting, where the only constant is change, it has now been suggested to me that while EDM is quite likely to host the Stanley Cup final, it can’t be called fully locked in at this moment in time.

Looking at the Oilers roster for Phase 3 of camp, set to open around July 10th.
Dave Tippett is just about finished his 14-day quarantine after flying in from somewhere near Minnesota.
Ryan Nugent-Hopkins joined the growing group of players training at Rogers Place yesterday.
An update on Dmitri Samorukov , who opted to spend next season in Russia’s KHL rather than waiting to see when (or, more likely, if) the AHL will resume in time.
This week in history, the Oilers traded Captain Doug Weight for a package including Marty Reasoner , Jochen Hecht , and Jan Horacek.
One piece of this pandemic I’m surely underrating is how significant an offseason’s worth of time off and training would be for Connor McDavid , who had to spend most of last summer rehabbing his leg. Look out.
Bleacher Report tried to predict the future of a handful of unrestricted free agents, including one Taylor Hall . Their prediction? Hall signs in Edmonton. A man can dream.
Speaking of free agents, rumor has it that the big date for UFAs this year will be November 1.
Have a great weekend and we’ll see you on the other side!
