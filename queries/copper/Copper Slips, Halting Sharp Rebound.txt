Investors struggle to reconcile signs of a global economic recovery with the surge in coronavirus infections in the U.S.
Copper prices fell Friday, signaling a pause in the industrial metalâ€™s surge, on mounting concerns that the rally may have been overdone.
Copper futures for October delivery slipped about 1% to $6,030 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. The drop comes as investors struggle to reconcile signs of a global economic recovery with the surge in coronavirus infections in the U.S., which could deal a setback to manufacturers. Trading volumes are lower than usual with U.S. markets closed for the Independence Day holiday.
