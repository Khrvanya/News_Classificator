Castillo Copper (CCZ) has discovered a large anomalous area along a six-kilometre strike length at the Luanshya project in Zambia.
The Luanshya Project is located in Zambia's copper-belt, along the Lufilian Arc which hosts significant copper mineralisation.
This new anomalous area was identified by a soil sampling program that was undertaken by Castillo Copper's geology team.
The geology team has concluded that no previous exploration work has been done in this anomalous area.
A total of 913 data points have been collected so far from a northwest-southwest trending grid with lines 500 metres apart.
Besides this new area, portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analysis returned 15 copper samples, grading more than 200ppm (parts per million) from the surface.
"From our earlier understanding of the Luanshya project, we were expecting to find surface mineralisation aligned with the NW-SE trendline." Managing Director Simon Paull commented.
"However, defining a sizeable anomalous zone along a six-kilometre strike well exceeded the Board's expectations," he added.
Castillo Copper will now undertake geophysical surveys and combine the results with previous findings to outline future drill targets.
"The next phase of the exploration campaign for the Mkushi and Luanshya projects comprises ground geophysics surveys which should enable the geology team to formulate test-drill targets," Simon said.
Castillo Copper's share price is up a steady 12.5 per cent and shares are trading for 1.8 cents each at 1:30 pm AEST.
