How Much Are Carube Copper Corp. (CVE:CUC) Insiders Spending On Buying Shares?
We often see insiders buying up shares in companies that perform well over the long term. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So before you buy or sell Carube Copper Corp. ( CVE:CUC ), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.
Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.
We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own companyâ€™s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Chairman, Antony Manini, for CA$242k worth of shares, at about CA$0.035 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of CA$0.055, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was 58% of Antony Manini's holding. Antony Manini was the only individual insider to sell over the last year. Notably Antony Manini was also the biggest buyer, having purchased CA$385k worth of shares.
Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 7.58m shares worth CA$385k. But they sold 6910385 shares for CA$242k. In total, Carube Copper insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below.
