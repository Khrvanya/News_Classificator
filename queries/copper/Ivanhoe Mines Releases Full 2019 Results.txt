The main reason for the loss for the year ended December 31, 2018, was the exchange loss on translation of foreign operations of US$33.0 million, resulting from the weakening of the South African Rand by 17 percent from December 31, 2017, to December 31, 2018, compared to an exchange gain on translation of foreign operations recognized in 2019 of US$8.8 million.
