Three SaskPower employees have been fired after $12,000 worth of copper was stolen from the Crown utility.
The theft was included in a report released Monday on Crown corporation losses in the first three months of 2020.
The government says the scrap copper was stolen in previous years.
Because of the high scrap value, copper thefts are relatively common in Saskatchewan, although perhaps not ones involving SaskPower employees.
