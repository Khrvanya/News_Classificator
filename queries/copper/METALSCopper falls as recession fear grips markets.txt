LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Copper fell on Wednesday as moves by China’s central bank to bolster the economy were overshadowed by predictions of a deep global recession, which drove down stock markets and oil prices.
Copper, used in power and construction, has tumbled from above $6,300 a tonne in mid January to as low as $4,371 in March, but supply disruption and hopes of recovery in China, the biggest consumer of the metal, have lifted prices back above $5,000.
The benchmark contract on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 1.1% at $5,106 a tonne at 1602 GMT on Wednesday.
“I don’t think we are out of the woods yet,” said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann, predicting that a rash of weak economic data could push copper back to $4,500.
CHINA STIMULUS: China’s central bank cut a key interest rate to a record low and reduced the amount banks must hold as reserves by about $28 billion.
However, data on Friday is expected to show China’s economy suffered its first decline since at least 1992 in the first quarter. Factory data is also expected on Friday.
China reported a decline in new confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the mainland on Wednesday.
GLOBAL ECONOMY: The International Monetary Fund said this week the global economy could shrink by 3% this year - the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
U.S. FACTORIES: U.S. manufacturing output dropped by the most in just over 74 years in March.
MARKETS: World share indexes fell, oil dived 7% and investors took shelter in the dollar, driving it higher and making metals priced in the currency more expensive for non-U.S. buyers.
LME STOCKS/SPREAD: Copper inventories in LME-registered warehouses rose to a six-month high of 261,225 tonnes. The discount of cash copper against three-month metal widened to $30, its biggest since January, suggesting plentiful nearby supply. MCUSTX-TOTAL MCU0-3
