SINGAPORE, May 4 (Reuters) - London copper prices slipped to a near two-week low on Monday on fears of excess supply, as some producers looked set to resume operations and demand took a hit from the coronavirus outbreak.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell as much as 1% to $5,061 a tonne, its lowest since April 22.
The global copper market is headed for a surplus of between 200,000-300,000 tonnes in 2020, the head of miner Antofagasta told Chilean media.
Global metals demand is expected to dwindle this year, as coronavirus-induced lockdowns around the world bring economic activity to a virtual standstill.
Supply prospects for copper, meanwhile, got a boost after Peru, the world’s second-biggest-producer of copper, said on Sunday it will gradually ease virus-driven restrictions on key sectors including mining in May.
Glencore’s Zambian subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines will resume mining for 90 days following a backlash from the government, but the company still expects to go ahead with its initial plan to place operations on hold.
