CALUMET — The Public Schools of Calumet-Laurium-Keweenaw was able to conduct its 137th Graduation Exercises and Diploma Presentation Ceremony this past Saturday at Agassiz Field.
In spite of the nationwide COVID-19 pandemic, the school was able to conduct the ceremony, for which the weather cooperated with sunny skies and a refreshing breeze. Parents, relatives and friends were permitted to attend the event, with the football field providing ample room for social distancing, while still providing a great view of the stage.
C-L-K Schools can be proud of the 2020 graduating class. Of the 76 graduates, 33 were Honors Graduates, and three were co-valedictorians.
Senior Class President, Danika Billeck, who is also an Honors Graduate, offered the Welcome. While grateful for the graduation taking place in person, she could not help expressing mixed emotions. Although it is not exactly how anyone imagined it would be, she said, everyone was glad to work out the event, and having the opportunity to receive their diplomas face-to-face, rather than in the mail.
Superintendent Chris Davidson also expressed his appreciation over the turn of events that permitted the graduation to occur in person, rather than online.
Calumet High School’s Graduating Class of 2020 begins the procession to the stage area of Saturday’s Commencement Ceremony.
“We can finally celebrate in person,” he said before he received the queue for the ceremony to begin.
Davidson gave the Superintendent Address and High School Principal, Mrs. Jennifer Peters, gave the presentation of the Class of 2020.
