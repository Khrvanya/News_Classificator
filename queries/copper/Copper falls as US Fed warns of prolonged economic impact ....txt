SINGAPORE — Copper prices fell on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve chief warned of an “extended period” of weak economic growth, sparking concerns of lean demand for the metal.
The ductile metal, used in power and construction, is often seen as a gauge of economic health.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell vowed to use the U.S. central bank’s power as needed and called for additional fiscal spending to stem the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but he also brushed off plans to pursue a negative interest-rate policy.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell 0.3% to $5,211 a tonne by 0148 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) declined 0.2% to 42,900 yuan ($6,045.15) a tonne. Sentiment was also dampened after an emergencies expert with the World Health Organization said the virus “may never go away,” and called for a “massive effort” to counter it.
