Commodity-related stocks have been under a lot of turbulence since the onset of the year 2020 with some commodity-based stocks such as gold and iron ore performing strongly, while that related to consumption-based commodities such as oil and base metals tumbling.

Commodity stocks have been active in the exchanges in the wake of increased volatility on the commodity front with gold and iron ore stocks riding a bull rally over widespread economic conundrum due to COVID-19 outbreak while base metals stocks plunging considerably.

Apart from gold, iron ore has also been the top-performing commodity for the year so far with prices rallying considerably to reach a new 52-week high.

The surge in iron ore prices has fuelled ASX-listed iron ore stocks, prompting them to emerge as top-performing stocks so far.
ASX-listed iron ore stocks such as Fortescue Metals Group Limited ( ASX:FMG ) have rallied considerably to make it to the top-performing list with FMG delivering a YTD return of 46.78 per cent total return. Likewise, many ASX-listed iron ore stocks have followed the same trajectory.

In the recent past, there has been a considerable rally in copper prices, leading to a sentiment splash in ASX-listed copper stocks.
Copper prices have climbed the price ladder swiftly with copper cash surging Â ~ 30.76 per cent from the level of USD 4,617.5 per tonne (intraday low on 23 March 2020) to the current high of USD 6,038.00 per tonne (as on 30 June 2020) on LME.
The COVID-19 outbreak and weather challenges across Peru have impacted production across major mines, leading to a decline of 25 per cent in March 2020, with the first quarter production plunging by 12 per cent. This decline across Peru had a considerable impact on the global mine production, which slipped by 2.5 per cent in March 2020.
The decline in the global copper production along with falling copper inventories across LME supported the share price of ASX-listed copper stocks, which have now emerged among top performers.
On the above chart, it could be seen that copper stocks have been under an impeccable rally and strong returns from the onset of the second quarter till now with Emerald Resources NL ( ASX: EMR ) delivering a total return of 85.48 per cent, while OZ Minerals Limited ( ASX:OZL ) delivering 57.82 per cent for the same period.
In a nutshell, commodity stocks have witnessed a lot of turbulence since the beginning of the year 2020 over increased volatility on the global commodity front; however, while some commodity-related stocks such as gold and iron ore stocks have been consistently performing strongly amidst stormy market, base metals related stocks are among top performers.
