Havilah is increasing rare earth study work in South Australia after a discovery potential was confirmed by independent expert Ken Collerson.
Havilah Resources Ltd ( ASX:HAV ) director Simon Gray has purchased 100,000 shares in the company via on-market trades.
The company recently detected elevated levels of rare earth elements (REE) during re-assaying of drill samples from several deposits and prospects in northeast South Australia.
Elevated REE levels have been returned from the large Kalkaroo copper-gold-cobalt deposit and Croziers copper prospect while historical results from Eurinilla and Birksgate prospects also reveal REE.
Havilah will increase rare earth study work at several tenements in South Australia after a discovery potential was confirmed by independent expert Ken Collerson.
Collerson noted geochemical similarities with carbonatites from the largest REE deposit in the world at Bayon Obo in China to Havilah’s Kalkaroo Copper Gold Project and Croziers copper prospect, which has encouraged the company to carry out REE mineralogical and metallurgical recovery studies on drill samples over the next few months.
REE are of relevance and strategic importance given the Australian Government’s recent efforts in promoting international investment in the development of critical minerals resources within Australia.
