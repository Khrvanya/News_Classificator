Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands--(Newsfile Corp. - June 3, 2020) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) ("Talon" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that the Company has received assays from another drill hole from its winter 2020 exploration program at the Tamarack Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project ("Tamarack Project"), located in Minnesota, USA - this drill hole represents the highest nickel and copper grades intersected to date during the Company's winter 2020 exploration program. The Tamarack Project comprises the Tamarack North Project and the Tamarack South Project.
Drill hole 12TK0153C intersected 7.14 meters (23.4 feet) of mixed and massive sulphides ("MMS") grading 8.31% Ni, 3.26% Cu, 0.16% Co, 0.65 g/t Pd, 0.84 g/t Pt and 0.43 g/t Au (10.15% NiEq[1] or 27.06% CuEq[2]), starting at 578.45 meters (see Figure 1 and Annex 1);
The above includes 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) of massive sulphides grading 9.65% Ni, 3.99% Cu, 0.18% Co, 0.82 g/t Pd,1.32 g/t Pt and 0.77 g/t Au (12.00% NiEq or 32.00% CuEq) starting at 580 meters.
The primary objective of drill hole 12TK0153C was to test continuity of the high-grade Massive Sulphide Unit ("MSU") between previous drill holes 12TK153 and 13TK0171, with the distance in between these drill holes being approximately 50 meters (164 feet) (see Figure 1).
Drill hole 12TK0153 intersected 12.19 meters (40 feet) of MMS grading 6.85% Ni, 3.02% Cu, 0.12% Co, 0.50 g/t Pd, 0.49 g/t Pt and 0.12 g/t Au (8.38% NiEq or 22.28% CuEq) starting at 555.86 meters;
Drill hole 13TK0171 intersected 7.34 meters (24.1 feet) of MMS grading 8.28% Ni, 2.95% Cu, 0.15% Co, 0.55 g/t Pd, 0.39 g/t Pt and 0.19 g/t Au (9.81% NiEq or 26.06% CuEq) starting at 573.3 meters.
"The winter 2020 exploration program (which ran from January to March 2020) at Tamarack continues to deliver outstanding results," said Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon. "Of note, the 9.65% Ni that we just intercepted in the resource area is similar to the 9.95% Ni previously intercepted approximately 3 km north of our resource area,[3] and the 9.3% nickel intercepted approximately 1.6 km north-east of our resource area[4]." (see Annex 2)
Mr. van Rooyen continued, "We believe the geophysical survey results of the winter 2020 exploration program could be the turning point for exploration at the 18-km Tamarack Intrusive Complex. We are now preparing for our next exploration program at Tamarack, which will focus on cost-effectively making large step-outs from the resource area, with the goal of discovering entirely new massive sulphide bodies."
The Company looks forward to announcing the final set of assays from the winter 2020 exploration program when they are received.

Lengths are drill intersections and not necessarily true widths. True widths cannot be consistently calculated for comparison purposes between holes because of the irregular shapes of the mineralized zones. Drill intersections have been independently selected by Talon. Drill composites have been independently calculated by Talon. The geological interpretations in this news release are solely those of the Company.
The locations and distances highlighted on all maps in this news release are approximate.
Dr. Etienne Dinel, Vice President, Geology of Talon, is a Qualified Person within the meaning of NI 43-101. Dr. Dinel is satisfied that the analytical and testing procedures used are standard industry operating procedures and methodologies, and he has reviewed, approved and verified the technical information disclosed in this news release, including sampling, analytical and test data underlying the technical information.
Talon is a TSX-listed base metals company in a joint venture with Rio Tinto on the high-grade Tamarack Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project located in Minnesota, USA, comprised of the Tamarack North Project and the Tamarack South Project. Talon has an earn-in right to acquire up to 60% of the Tamarack Project. The Tamarack Project comprises a large land position (18km of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts outside of the current resource area. Talon is focussed on expanding its current high-grade nickel mineralization resource prepared in accordance with NI 43-101; identifying additional high-grade nickel mineralization; and developing a process to potentially produce nickel sulphates responsibly for batteries for the electric vehicles industry. Talon has a well-qualified mine management team with extensive experience in project management.
