Comparing the trend in Southern Copper Corp’s stock over recent months with its trajectory during and after the Great Recession of 2008, we believe that the stock can potentially gain 30% once fears surrounding the coronavirus outbreak subside. Our conclusion is based on our detailed comparison of Southern Copper Corp’s performance vis-à-vis the S&P 500 in our interactive dashboard analysis, 2007-08 vs. 2020 Crisis Comparison: How Did Southern Copper Corporation Stock Fare Compared With S&P 500?
The World Health organization declared a global health emergency at the end of January in light of the coronavirus spread. Between January 31st and March 25th, SCCO stock has lost 26% of its value (similar to 26% decline in the S&P 500). A bulk of the decline came after March 6th, when an increasing number of Coronavirus cases outside China fueled concerns of a global economic slowdown. Matters were only made worse by fears of a price war in the oil industry triggered by an increase in oil production by Saudi Arabia.
Copper mining companies’ stocks generally move in tandem with the broader market trend and economic growth trends.
With industrial activity slowing down, the demand for copper from sectors such as automobile, construction, electric appliances, etc has decreased significantly, leading to a sharp drop in copper price to $2.17/pound on March 20, 2020, compared to $2.80 at the beginning of 2020.
Lower prices and decreased shipments (due to fall in demand) is likely to put immense pressure on the company’s revenues in 2020, leading to a sharp drop in the company’s stock price.
We believe SCCO’s Q1 and Q2 results will confirm this reality with drop in revenues.
If signs of coronavirus containment aren’t clear by the Q1 earnings timeframe, it’s likely SCCO’s stock along with the broader market is going to see continued drop.
