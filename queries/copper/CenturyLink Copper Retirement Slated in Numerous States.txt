CenturyLink is asking the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to approve copper retirement in a number of states.
The retirements are due primarily to growth in the areas. CenturyLink will replace copper loops with fiber loops as customers migrate to higher speed broadband. It provides that broadband over its fiber-to-the-home overlay architecture.
CenturyLink copper retirement will happen in parts of Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah and Washington. The company scheduled the fiber implementations for September.
Randy Clarke is CenturyLink’s vice president of federal regulatory affairs. He said his company “constantly strives” to exceed its customers’ expectations.
“As consumers and the industry transition to next-generation products to stay connected, we are retiring some copper facilities that are no longer needed for the modern services our customers are increasingly relying on today,” he said. “CenturyLink transforms its networks, and provides innovative products and services our customers want, while assuring them we understand our responsibility to continue to meet all public safety needs.”
In addition to accommodating for growth, CenturyLink said road construction and maintenance problems often prompt copper retirements. The company will provide more specific information to customers affected in each location.
If no one files an objection, copper retirement notices usually go final on the 90th day after the release of the public notice of the filing. Retirements that don’t involve customers are final on the 15th day after public notice.
The retirements won’t affect rates, terms and conditions where the affected service converts to a comparable one, according to CenturyLink.
Earlier this month, analysts at MoffettNathanson , the independent research firm, said more CenturyLink business customers might drop their landline phone service if a prolonged recession grips the country.
