TORONTO, Jan. 2, 2020 /CNW/ - Doré Copper Mining Corp. (the "Corporation" or "Doré Copper") (TSXV: DCMC ) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Joe Mann gold mine ("Joe Mann") located in Québec. The mine is located approximately 50 km from the Corporation's Copper Rand mill, where mineralized material from Joe Mann was processed from 2004 until its closure in 2007, and is accessible by all season roads. Joe Mann has been privately held since 2008. The Corporation does not currently consider Joe Mann to be a material property for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101.

Production of 1.173 million ounces of gold at a grade of 8.26 g/t Au, 607,000 ounces of silver at 5 g/t Ag and 28.7 million pounds of copper at 0.25% Cu (Source: Technical Report on the Joe Mann Mining Property dated January 11, 2016, prepared by Geologica Inc.).
Mineralization remains strong and persistent at depth with Hole EE-189B intersecting 26.66 g/t Au over 1.8 m and Hole EE-188 intersecting 30.3 g/t Au and 1.3% Cu over 3.02 m extending the Main Zone 170 meters down dip.
The more recently discovered West Zone, a potential structural off-set that allows much thicker, higher-grade veins to form, remains open and is a high priority exploration target with historic intercepts including 2.44 m @ 24.62 g/t Au, 3.93 m @ 31.54 g/t Au, 2.62 m @ 24.28 g/t Au and 3.2 m @ 16.1 g/t Au.
Exploration potential remains excellent including new parallel zones identified by recent surface prospecting work that lie just several hundred meters to the south of the main mine.
Significant infrastructure in place including power and a shaft down to the 1,145-meter level.
Ernest Mast, President and CEO of Doré Copper commented, "Joe Mann was closed during a period of low gold prices. This is a rare opportunity to secure a significant high-grade gold underground asset that remains open at depth and along strike with numerous high priority exploration targets. An exploration program at Joe Mann will focus on the significant potential to extend high-grade mineralization at depth as well as defining new zones of mineralization, all accessible from the 3,775-foot shaft (see Figure 1). We believe Joe Mann may demonstrate similar potential to Wesdome's Eagle River, Alamos' Island Gold or Kirkland Lake's Macassa mine where the high-grade gold deposits not only continue at depth but with improved grades while yielding new discoveries. Joe Mann fits into our exploration and development plans, adding another high-grade gold-copper project to our portfolio to leverage our strategically located mill."
Joe Mann operated for 27 of the years between 1956 and 2007, with mineralized material processed at an onsite mill, the Principale mill, and Doré Copper's Copper Rand mill.
Joe Mann consists of 55 mineral titles comprising 1,990.2 hectares of land. Doré Copper already owns 22 claims in the Joe Mann area via its 100% owned subsidiary CBAY Minerals Inc. Four of the 22 claims were recently acquired and are currently being transferred to CBAY Minerals Inc.
Joe Mann is characterized by E-W striking shear hosted veins that extend beyond 1,000 m vertically with mineralization identified over 3 km in strike. Gold mineralization at Joe Mann occurs within deformed quartz-sulphide veins hosted in high strain shear zones affecting mafic intrusions and felsic volcanic rocks metamorphosed to lower-amphibolite assemblages.
Substantial infrastructure remains at Joe Mann with the shaft down to the 3,775-foot level (1,145 meters). Significant potential remains at Joe Mann to extend the mineralization at depth and along strike, including the West Zone and potential new zones to the North and South. Thick, high-grade gold mineralization was encountered at depth between the 2750 level and the 3450 level (see Figure 2). In 2007-2008, after the mine closed, three holes were drilled from underground to test the depth extensions of the mine approximately 170 m below the lowest level (3,450 ft below surface). Hole EE-189B intersected the Main Zone and returned 26.66 g/t Au over 1.8 m and 14.72 g/t Au over 1.2 m. Hole EE-188 intersected the Main Zone, 30.3 g/t Au and 1.3% Cu over 3.02 m and the South Zone, 9.23 g/t Au over 0.91 m. One of the holes did not reach the Main Zone. These drill holes show that the mineralization is still strong and persistent down dip with excellent potential along the entire untested strike at depth. These holes represent the latest drilling results on the property.
The plunge of the mineralized body is to the east, with the West Zone being one of the most promising areas of upside potential for thick high-grade mineralization because of the limited amount of drilling and exploration done in that area historically down dip/plunge of the known mineralization. The West Zone might be an area of structural off-set (jog) that allows a much thicker, higher-grade vein to form, with more drilling and study required to confirm. Historic intercepts include: 2.44 m @ 24.62 g/t Au, 3.93 m @ 31.54 g/t Au and 2.62 m @ 24.28 g/t Au (mined) and 5.0 m at 10.3 g/t Au, 3.2 m @ 16.1 g/t Au and 3.3 m @ 10.4 g/t Au (unmined).
New parallel zones have been identified by recent surface prospecting work that lie just several hundred meters to the south of the main mine.
A high-grade core was identified from the 2750 level down to the 3450 level including 18.4 g/t Au over 7.5 meters (0.537 oz/t over 24.6 feet) and 9.70 g/t Au over 18.1 meters (0.283 oz/t over 45.3 feet). The drill holes from 2007 to 2008 intersected the vein 170 m below the lowest level shown and indicated that the high-grade mineralization continues down dip. The shaft that was deepened in 2001 goes to a depth of 1,145 meters.
In 2017 a high resolution airborne magnetic survey was completed and several magnetic anomalies of moderate to strong amplitudes were identified. In addition to Joe Mann being open along strike and at depth, Joe Mann was poorly explored to the south, and the magnetic survey has identified numerous high-priority exploration targets at Joe Mann.
The Corporation has entered into an option agreement with the owners of Joe Mann, Ressources Jessie Inc. ("Ressources Jessie") and Legault Metals Inc. ("Legault"), to acquire a 100% interest in Joe Mann on the following terms:
A cash payment of $250,000 to Ressources Jessie and $500,000 in Doré Copper Shares to be issued to Legault on the first anniversary of the Effective Date.
A cash payment of $1,000,000 to Ressources Jessie upon completion of 5,000 meters of drilling at Joe Mann or on the earlier of the second anniversary of the Effective Date or 18 months from the commencement of drilling.
