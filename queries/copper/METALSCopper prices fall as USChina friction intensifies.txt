SINGAPORE, May 22 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Friday as mounting Sino-U.S. tensions and concerns about a rebound from the coronavirus-led economic slump curbed risk appetite and demand for metals.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.4% at $5,369.50 a tonne, as of 0120 GMT, while the most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) declined 0.9% to 43,810 yuan ($6,158.45) a tonne.
Asian shares were set for another retreat after China’s plans to impose a new national security legislation on Hong Kong drew a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington would react “very strongly” against the attempt.
Tensions stoked worries that a U.S.-China “Phase 1” trade deal could be threatened. China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, said it will not start any trouble but will not flinch from any escalation either.
