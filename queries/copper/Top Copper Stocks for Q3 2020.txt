Copper is used for a broad range of applications in electronics, construction, power generation, and transmission. Some of the big names in the sector include China-based Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd., Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( FCX ), and U.K.-based KAZ Minerals Plc. Copper stocks, as represented by the Global X Copper Miners ETF ( COPX ), have dramatically underperformed the broader market in the last 12 months, with total returns of -15.6% as compared to the S&P 500's return of 6.5%.﻿﻿ Copper prices fell drastically through the first half of the year in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have only recouped part of their losses.
