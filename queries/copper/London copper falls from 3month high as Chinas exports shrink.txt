SINGAPORE — London copper prices on Monday retreated from a three-month high hit in the previous session, after data showed top consumer China’s exports weakened in May.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell 1.2% to $5,624 a tonne by 0124 GMT, while the most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) rose 1.1% to 45,480 yuan ($6,423.00) a tonne, tracking gains in London in the previous session.
China’s exports contracted in May as global coronavirus lockdowns continued to devastate demand, although at a smaller pace than expected, while imports fell at the sharpest rate since January 2016.
Weak exports highlighted the pressure on China’s manufacturing industry, one of the major consumers of copper.
