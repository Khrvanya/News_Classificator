Copper futures’ bullish correction from the 45-month low of 1.9684 appears to have lost steam as it approaches the restrictive trend line drawn from the 8½-month peak of 2.8819. Further suggesting that positive momentum is wavering is the RSI that has dipped back below its neutral 50 mark and the stochastic lines, which have reversed ahead of the 80 overbought border.
While the MACD, in the negative section, continues to move above its red trigger line suggesting that the price may test the falling trend line, the downwards sloping simple moving averages (SMAs), specifically the 50- and 100-day ones, maintain alignment with the prevailing negative structure.
If the price extends its current losses, initial support could rest at the 2.2424 low ahead of the 2.1769 hurdle. Next, the bears would need to push under the 2.1469 and 2.1311 troughs to spark a plunge towards the 2.0184 obstacle and a retest of the multi-year low of 1.9684.
However, if the bulls manage to steer back up, the 2.3479 recent high could display initial upside hindrance. Subsequently achieving a break above the descending trend line could accumulate buying interest to challenge the 2.3974 inside swing low and the 50-day SMA at 2.4126 overhead. Overcoming these obstacles, the price may rally, finding its next restrictions at the swing highs of 2.5274 and 2.5589 prior to the 100- and 200-day SMAs currently at 2.5753 and 2.5987 respectively.
In brief, the short-term bias still paints a bearish picture below the descending line and the 2.5274 swing high.

XM uses cookies to ensure that we provide you with the best experience while visiting our website. Some of the cookies are needed to provide essential features, such as login sessions, and cannot be disabled.

Cookies are small data files. When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser.
Cookies do not transfer viruses or malware to your computer. Because the data in a cookie does not change when it travels back and forth, it has no way to affect how your computer runs, but they act more like logs (i.e. they record user activity and remember stateful information) and they get updated every time you visit a website.
We may obtain information about you by accessing cookies, sent by our website. Different types of cookies keep track of different activities. For example, session cookies are used only when a person is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the website, the session cookie disappears.
We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our website’s performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and improve our future advertising campaigns.
Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members Area to deposit funds, a "session cookie" is set so that the website remembers that you have already logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on each new page as you progress through the funding process.
In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our trading platform, and recall your preferences, such as which language you wish to see when you log in.
