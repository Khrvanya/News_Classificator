SINGAPORE, March 11 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Wednesday as worries over the unabating spread of the coronavirus erased gains fuelled by hopes for stimulus measures to cushion the rising economic damage from the outbreak.
The White House and Congress negotiated measures on Tuesday to bolster the U.S. economy against the epidemic’s impact, while Japan announced a second package of measures worth about $4 billion.
But growing scepticism about Washington’s stimulus package to fight the outbreak knocked the steam out of earlier rallies.
“We expect that in the short- to medium-term, market volatility will remain, as governments across the world look to provide firm commitments to substantial economic stimulus packages,” Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities said in a note.
“There may still be a long way before market fear is mitigated and confidence is fully restored,” Lau said.
