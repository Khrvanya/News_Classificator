LONDON — Copper prices slumped on Tuesday as investors liquidated recent bullish positions over fears that a new strain of coronavirus in China could hit economic growth in the world top metals consumer.
The metal often used as a gauge of economic health also suffered after inventories in London Metal Exchange-registered warehouses jumped by a third overnight, providing a boost to supplies in LME depots after months of erosion.
The World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday that the new coronavirus was likely to spread to other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days as the death toll in China rose to six.
China is also preparing for its week-long Lunar New Year holiday, starting on Jan. 24, with many traders closing their positions before taking time off and millions of people traveling, stoking fears of a wider spread of the virus.
“The sector is taking a bit of a tumble. Even though it’s (virus) on a relatively small scale right now, it just hits confidence, having a dampening impact on the otherwise risk-on climate that’s we’ve had so far this year,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.
Funds are net long of the CME copper contract for the first time in nine months and the speculative net long position on the LME had grown to 15% of open interest as of Friday, according to estimates by broker Marex Spectron.
“A lot of these recently established longs are potentially getting close to being out of pocket and that’s adding to the selling pressure,” Hansen said.
Benchmark LME copper had slid 1.6% to $6,161.50 a tonne by 1120 GMT, the biggest one-day loss since Oct. 31. It earlier touched $6,150, the weakest level since Jan. 8.
The most-active copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed down 1.4% at a six-week low of 48,420 yuan a tonne.
* COPPER STOCKS: LME copper inventories  surged by 38,700 tonnes to 162,925 tonnes, daily LME data showed. Until the big inflows, stocks had shed 63% from their peak last August.
* COPPER DEFICIT: The global world refined copper market showed a deficit of 33,000 tonnes in October, down from 89,000 tonnes in September, data showed.
* ZINC SPREAD: The premium of LME cash zinc to the three month contract  has increased to $22.25 a tonne, the highest since Nov. 29 and compared to a discount of $3.50 on Dec. 11. This indicates tighter availability of LME supplies.
* OTHER PRICES: LME aluminum added 0.6% to $1,823.50 a tonne, zinc fell 0.4% to $2,435, nickel shed 1.2% to $13,855, lead added 0.2% to $1,965.50 while tin lost 0.8% to $17,715 after earlier rising to $17,970, the strongest since July last year.
