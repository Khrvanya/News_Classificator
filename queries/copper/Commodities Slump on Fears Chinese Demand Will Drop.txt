Commodities including crude oil and copper fell Thursday, extending their recent slide on concerns that the worsening coronavirus outbreak would pare Chinese demand for raw materials.
Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, dropped 2.5% to $58.29 a barrel, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 8. The futures prices have tumbled 15% since their recent high on Jan. 6, a decline exacerbated by government data released Wednesday showing that U.S. inventories of crude oil unexpectedly increased by 3.5 million barrels last week.
