Similar to any other commodity, copper supply can be prone to disruption in various capacities: environmental events, worker strikes, economic fluctuations and so on. As such, it’s important to keep an eye on what’s happening in the world’s major copper-producing countries , such as Chile, Peru and China.
2019 has seen a handful of disruptive production hiccups, including a strike at Codelco’s Chuquicamata mine, known as one of the world’s biggest copper mines . The issues have contributed to big picture concerns, with some experts nervously anticipating an eventual deficit in copper supply .
While that copper deficit may not come to fruition for quite some time, copper’s long-term demand outlook remains strong. According to the Copper Development Association , copper demand driven by EVs is expected to grow by 1,700 kilotons by 2027.
Ongoing trade war issues between China and the US have also had a notable impact on copper as of late. With China being the world’s largest copper consumer, new Chinese import restrictions on copper scrap could put a substantial dent in the market.
According to Reuters , China has been working to limit scrap imports in an effort to reduce the shipment of foreign solid waste into the country; however, the outlet notes that scrap accounted for 10 percent of China’s copper use last year.
As with any metal, supply shortages can lead to jumps in price, assuming demand remains intact or rises. The balancing act of supply and demand is fickle, and investors who are curious about copper may want to get involved sooner rather than later.
