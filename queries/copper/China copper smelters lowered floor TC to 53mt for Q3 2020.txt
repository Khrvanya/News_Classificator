SHANGHAI, Jul 3 (SMM) – China’s top copper smelters have set their floor treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) for the third quarter of 2020 at $53/mt and 5.3 cents/lb, SMM learned.
The floor charges, the minimum that miners pay smelters to process their copper concentrate into refined metal, were finalised at a quarterly, virtual meeting of the China Smelters Purchase Team (CSPT) on Friday July 3.
The Q3 2020 floor TC/RC marked a sharp decrease from $67/mt and 6.7 cents/lb for Q1 of the year, as the team failed to reach an agreement for Q2 .
SMM copper concentrate index, which tracks TCs for spot trades of imported copper concentrate in China, stood at a multi-year low of $51.37/mt for the week ended July 3.
