Copper mine supply and project development expenditures are plunging just as China is unleashing massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, making a large deficit and soaring prices in 2021 increasingly likely.
With 2020 being the final transition year for FCX's Grasberg underground mine, sharply higher copper prices next year will coincide with steep production increases.
With over $2 billion in cash, no substantial debt maturities for years, and cash costs well below current copper prices, FCX is well positioned for further near-term copper price declines.
We have increasing conviction in our $34 price target as a result of recent developments; FCX's stock trades at just ~2X our 2021 EBITDA estimate, and each point of multiple expansion adds ~$5 per share to the stock.
