Oil prices climbed Friday, sending U.S. crude back near $40 a barrel with traders hopeful that global fuel demand will rebound more quickly than anticipated.
U.S. crude futures for delivery in July rose 2.3% to $39.75 a barrel, recording for their highest close since early March. Prices started the year above $60, briefly collapsed below $0 for the first time ever in late April due to a global glut of oil and are now rebounding with drivers returning to the road and producers curtailing supply.
