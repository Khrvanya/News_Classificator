Commodities from oil to copper kept dropping Thursday, continuing a recent slide as traders expect the spreading coronavirus to cripple demand.
U.S. crude-oil futures slid 3.4% to $47.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, paring some of an earlier drop, but still recording the futures' lowest close since January 2019. Prices are now 29% below a peak hit early this year. Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, closed down 2.3% to $52.18 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange.
