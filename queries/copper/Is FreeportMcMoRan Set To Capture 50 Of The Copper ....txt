The top players in the copper space generated around $21.2 billion in revenues over 2019, posting a y-o-y decline of about 17.4%.
Market size has decreased from $22.7 billion in 2015 to $21.2 billion in 2019, marking a decline of 6.7% during this period, with almost all of the decrease coming in 2019 due to a crash in output and lower pricing.
However, the market size is expected to increase by 13.5% to $24 billion by 2025, on the back of higher shipments and increased pricing.
Despite projected market growth of 13.5% from the current level through 2025, Freeport-McMoRan’s market share is likely to see a growth of ~50%, from 34% in 2019 to >50% by 2025, primarily due to higher volume with full production at the Grasberg mine and Lone Star project.
Below we explore the volume, price, and revenue forecast for major copper companies, and see how Freeport-McMoRan’s market share is rising
BHP Billiton leads the copper mining market with respect to volume sales, with about 3.4 billion pounds of copper sold in 2019, followed by Freeport-McMoRan, Rio Tinto, Barrick Gold, and Newmont Goldcorp, which posted volume sales of 2.6 billion, 0.7 billion, 0.4 billion, and 0.1 billion, respectively.
Freeport-McMoRan saw a sharp volume decline in 2019 due to negligible output from the Grasberg mine in Indonesia.
With Freeport-McMoRan’s 2-year mine transition expected to complete by end of 2020, copper output is expected to go back to the pre-transition period. Additionally, first production from the new Lone Star project is expected to come up in Q4 2020, with output addition from the project in the initial period expected to be around 200 million pounds, to be expanded later.
All companies except Freeport-McMoRan are likely to see their volume decrease from 2019 to 2025 on the back of depleting reserves, in the absence of any major deal during this period.
Thus, Freeport-McMoRan is set to outperform its rivals and increase its volume sales from 2.6 million pounds in 2019 to 3.6 million pounds in 2025.
Price realization has been volatile for all companies over the years, and has moved in tandem with global copper prices. Price realization dipped in 2019 for all companies due to the fall in global copper prices on the back of US-China trade tensions taking a toll on the economic growth outlook. BHP commands the highest price for its product due to its high-grade ores and value-added features, whereas the other companies are clustered together at a slightly lower price range.
However, price realization is expected to see a slight uptick for all copper companies in the medium term, mainly due to higher demand for electric vehicle manufacturers.
The outbreak of coronavirus has taken a toll on prices since the beginning of the year. Prices are expected to remain subdued in the near term as the spread of the virus is expected to lead to a decline in global demand and economic growth.
However, prices are expected to rebound from 2021, with easing tension between the US and China, and a decrease in the severity of the effect of the coronavirus.
With the share of output from the high-grade Grasberg mine (2nd largest copper mine in the world) in Freeport-McMoRan’s copper shipments expected to increase from 2021, Freeport-McMoRan’s price realization is expected to increase from $2.73/pound in 2019 to $3.30/pound in 2025, as the output from Grasberg is priced at a premium.
Thus, Freeport-McMoRan’s output is likely to see higher growth in prices compared to its rivals during the 2019-2025 period.
Freeport-McMoRan is expected to see revenue growth of close to 70% as its revenue is likely to grow from $7.1 billion in 2019 to $12 billion in 2025. All other major copper companies are expected to see a reduction in copper revenues during this period, on the back of lower output, partially offset by higher prices.
Freeport-McMoRan’s market share in the copper market is expected to rise from 33.7% in 2019 to over 50% by 2025.
This compares with- BHP’s market share decline from 51.2% in 2019 to 38.2% in 2025; Rio Tinto’s market share decline from 9.5% in 2019 to 7.7% in 2025; Barrick Gold’s market share decline from 4.6% in 2019 to 3.2% in 2025; and Newmont Goldcorp’s market share decline from 1% in 2019 to 0.8% in 2025.
Thus, Freeport-McMoRan, with the highest market share in the medium term, is likely to be the dominant player in the copper sector, primarily benefiting from higher output from Indonesia, the addition of a new facility in the form of the Lone Star project, and a favorable copper price outlook.
