Copper inventories in ShFE warehouses CU-STX-SGH in the week to June 5 fell 3.5% to 139,913 tonnes, their lowest level since Jan. 23, as economic activity picks up in China after it eased its coronavirus lockdown.

Aluminium stockpiles AL-STX-SGH dropped 10% over the week to 266,588 tonnes, their lowest since Feb. 7.
Lead inventories in ShFE warehouses PB-STX-SGH rose for a fourth straight week, increasing 4.7% to 9,025 tonnes.
