The Copper Country Great Start Collaborative began in April, 2008, with a grant from the State of Michigan through the Early Childhood Investment Corporation. The stated mission of the collaborative is to work together to help every child in the Copper Country be safe, healthy and ready to succeed in school and in life, and works to ensure that every child in Baraga, Houghton and Keweenaw Counties – and their parents – has the services they need for physical health, social and emotional health, quality care and early learning, as well as parent leadership and support.
Collaborative members include parents, community leaders, business owners, charitable and faith-based organizations, health and human service agencies, and educators all working toward the same goals.
• Identify community needs and services around the five focus areas of Pediatric and Family Health, Social and Emotional Health, Child Care and Early Learning, Parenting Leadership, and Family Support.
• Plan and coordinate services to meet those needs.
• Promote community awareness of early childhood issues, programs and services.
• Advocate for quality early childhood programs and services.
• Members provide overall direction in the governance and operations of the Collaborative, appoint committees, and oversee the progress on the Strategic Plan and Scope of Work. The group meets a minimum of 4 times a year.
Tasks are accomplished via standing and ad hoc committees who report to the Collaborative. Specific Committees and their tasks can be found in the Operating Guidelines.
Collaborative members include parents, community leaders, business owners, charitable and faith-based organizations, health and human service agencies, and educators all working toward the same goals.
