Matthew Miller, metals and mining analyst at CFRA Research, said: “CFRA forecasts a structurally tight copper market that could be poised for a strong recovery; for the best leverage to copper prices we highlight copper miners First Quantum Minerals, Freeport-McMoRan, Southern Copper and Teck Resources.”
Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer relied on sales of the precious metal for more than 70% of its revenue last year. In 2019 it has struggled due to lower copper prices and slow output at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, which is in transition from an open pit to an underground mine. First Quantum is one of only a few “pure-play” copper companies, while copper is set to become an increasingly important part of Teck’s diversified portfolio. CFRA also said Southern Copper Corporation had copper reserves of 68.4 million tonnes.
