Great Boulder Resources to begin drill testing priority gold targets at Whiteheads this month, shares up
With advanced copper-nickel-cobalt projects and the Whiteheads Gold Project plus the backing of a strong technical team, the company is well-positioned for future success.
Great Boulder Resources Ltd ( ASX:GBR ) is set to recommence aircore drilling at the Whiteheads project north of Kalgoorlie in WA this month with testing of priority gold targets at Arsenal anomaly.
The program, which will begin in mid-July, is designed to identify north-south trending zones of gold mineralisation within the weathering profile.
Shares have surged almost 36% this morning to 3.8 cents and are up from 2.4 cents at the close on June 24.
Great Boulder managing director Andrew Paterson said the company was excited to be drilling again at Whiteheads.
“We’ve been fairly quiet for the past couple of months, conserving cash while the coronavirus pandemic played out.
“Now that things are returning to normal in Western Australia we’re looking forward to testing these priority anomalies at Whiteheads.
Drilling will also test strike extensions to gold mineralisation at the Lindsays South area, within the newly granted tenement E27/588.
This tenement surrounds a high density of historic and recent mining areas, including the Lindsays gold mine owned by KalNorth Gold Mines Ltd ( ASX:KGM ).
With advanced copper-nickel-cobalt projects including Mt Venn and Winchester and the Whiteheads Gold Project plus the backing of a strong technical team, the company is well-positioned for future success.
