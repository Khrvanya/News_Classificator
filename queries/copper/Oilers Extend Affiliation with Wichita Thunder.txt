Yesterday afternoon, the Edmonton Oilers and Wichita Thunder announced a multi-year extension to their affiliation agreement.
Bill Scott, Director of Salary Cap Management & Assistant to the President of Hockey Operations for the Edmonton Oilers, had this to say:
“The Thunder have been first-class partners over the past three seasons and we are very confident in Coach Ramsay and the Thunder organization to develop future players for the Condors and Oilers. Furthermore, we understand the importance of having a winning environment at all levels in our organization and so we want to reaffirm our commitment to the Thunder and their fans that we will work towards achieving that success together!”
Wichita head coach Bruce Ramsay echoed Scott’s sentiments:
Thunder GM Joel Lomurno on the extension:
Wichita has struggled to find its footing after joining the ECHL from the now-defunct CHL in advance of the 2014-15 season, with only one playoff appearance to their credit.
Current Oilers prospects that spent time in Wichita this season include names like Ostap Safin , Jakob Stukel , Vincent Desharnais , and Stuart Skinner among others.
Wichita’s 2019-20 season was officially cancelled, but tickets for the 2020-21 season are on sale now in case any Kansas-based readers are interested. Click here for ticketing information.
