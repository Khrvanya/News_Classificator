Doré Copper Mining (TSXV: DCMC) announced Thursday that it has entered into an option agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Joe Mann gold mine from Ressources Jessie and Legault Metals.
Terms of the deal include a series of cash payments totaling over C$5 million starting from the effective date to the beginning of commercial production and the transfer of common shares.
A 2% net smelter return royalty will be granted to Ressources Jessie, and Doré will hold the option to buy back 1% for C$2 million and a further 0.5% for C$4 million.

The mine consists of 55 mineral titles comprising 1,990 hectares. Doré Copper already owns 22 claims in the Joe Mann area via its 100% owned subsidiary CBAY Minerals. Four of the 22 claims were recently acquired and are currently being transferred to CBAY Minerals, the company said in a press release.
at depth, the property was poorly explored to the south, and the magnetic
survey has identified numerous high-priority exploration targets.
“This is a rare opportunity to secure a significant high-grade gold underground asset that remains open at depth and along strike with numerous high-priority exploration targets. An exploration program at Joe Mann will focus on the significant potential to extend high-grade mineralization at depth as well as defining new zones of mineralization,” said president and CEO Ernest Mast.
At market close Thursday, Doré Copper’s stock was up 8%. The company has a C$36 million market capitalization.
