Mining giant Glencore is set to merge its Queensland copper and zinc operations to function under a single management structure, raising concerns for potential job losses.
"I'll be watching this very closely, and I don't give a stuff who owns the mines or what their name is," he said.
"If they start making decisions, whether it be on the CopperString project â€¦ or whether it's a decision like this, I'll quickly become a large adversary to them.

Mr Katter says he has many questions following the announcement.
"[It] certainly raises some interesting questions; I would say copper, compared to zinc locally, have a better record of supporting local initiatives," he said.
"The question raised is whether this mean less workers and that's a very important question to get answers on.
"We want to hear announcements of job creations out here so that's a deep concern with this; the job losses."
When asked, the spokeswoman said it was too "premature to comment" on job losses.
"The first step involves putting in place a consultation process to understand how best to transition to a single management structure," she said.
The restructured Glencore Queensland Metals business will be lead by the current chief operating officer, Matt O'Neill.
