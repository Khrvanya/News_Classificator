Hindustan Copper Limited ( NSE:HINDCOPPER ) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 25% in the last month. But that is little comfort to those holding over the last half decade, sitting on a big loss. Indeed, the share price is down 54% in the period. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. But it could be that the fall was overdone.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Looking back five years, both Hindustan Copper’s share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 14% per year. This change in EPS is remarkably close to the 14% average annual decrease in the share price. This suggests that market participants have not changed their view of the company all that much. So it’s fair to say the share price has been responding to changes in EPS.

It’s probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It’s always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Hindustan Copper’s earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
We regret to report that Hindustan Copper shareholders are down 37% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately, that’s worse than the broader market decline of 4.3%. Having said that, it’s inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year’s performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 14% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
