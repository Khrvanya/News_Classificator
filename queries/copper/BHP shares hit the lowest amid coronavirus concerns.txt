Share price in Anglo-Australian mining multinational BHP has hit the lowest point in a month, with London Stock Exchange stock prices dropping yesterday by 4% from £17.80 to £16.99. At the time of writing, they have fallen a further 0.54% today, with prices going as low as £16.93.
Such a steep decline in prices, analysts say, can be linked to the growing concerns over the impact of coronavirus on China’s economy.
GlobalData analyst David Kurtz said: “With tens of millions of people under lockdown, concerns over the impact of coronavirus are leading to a decline in prices of key commodities, such as copper and iron ore.
“While it is still too early to tell how widespread this disease will be, given BHP’s exposure to these commodities, it is negatively impacting its share price.”
GlobalData analyst Vinneth Bajaj told Mining Technology that China – the world’s largest importer of copper covering 43% of world imports in 2017 – has been a central source of profits for BHP and disruptions to its economy can affect the company negatively.
