SHANGHAI, Jul 2 (SMM) – The long-anticipated new standards for high-grade copper scrap and aluminium scrap metal —due to come into force on July 1–has yet to be implemented at China’s customs, as the procedure for importing material under these standards has not been finalised, SMM learned from several traders, fabricators and smelters.
That leaves the country’s imports of such materials under the restriction of the quota scheme, which would remain in place until the end of 2020.
China plans to cut imports of solid waste to zero by the end of this year, but published the new standards for high-grade copper scrap and aluminium scrap metal in January to indicate what material will still be allowed into the country after then.
High-grade copper and aluminium scrap meeting the new standards will be classed as a resource rather than waste.
SMM learned from several large fabricators and smelters who have been importing aluminium scrap for a long time that import quotas for aluminium scrap for the third quarter will be barely changed with those for the second quarter.
