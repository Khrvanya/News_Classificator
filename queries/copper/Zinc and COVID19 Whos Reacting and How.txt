“As the workforce for the project includes many contract employees who travel from other regions of Portugal and internationally, the risk is that the virus could be brought to the Alentejo region by people travelling to come to work on our project,” said President and CEO Marie Inkster.
Lundin continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and has taken other actions such as restricting travel and limiting external visitors to its sites.
Nyrstar (OTC Pink: NYRSY ,EBR:NYR) — Nystar is the world’s second largest zinc producer and has global mining and metals processing operations. It said on March 16 that it would be taking precautionary measures at its upcoming shareholder meetings due to COVID-19.
Trevali Mining (TSX: TV ,OTCQX:TREVF) — Trevali Mining produces base metals at four mines in North America, South America and Africa. It also has exploration assets in North America and Africa.
The company said on March 17 that its Santander zinc-lead-silver mine in Peru continued to operate even though a state of national emergency had been declared in the country. The government order, which was set to last for 15 days, restricted travel and required people to stay at home other than for key outings, but the rules do not apply to operations like Santander.
Ten days later, Trevali released an update on the situation after the Peruvian government extended the state of emergency for an additional 13 days. While mining and other activities will continue at Santander during that time, the company said that it will not be able to process ore during the extension.
Additionally, on March 26, activities were suspended at Trevali’s Caribou zinc-lead-silver mine in New Brunswick. According to the company, the decision was driven by market conditions, including COVID-19 and a deteriorating zinc market, as well as high concentrate treatment charges. The asset is being placed on care and maintenance to preserve its value.
