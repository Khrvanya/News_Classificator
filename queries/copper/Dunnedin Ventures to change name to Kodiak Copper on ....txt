Dunnedin Ventures to change name to Kodiak Copper on Wednesday, April 1
Dunnedin Ventures Inc ( CVE:DVI ) (OTCMKTS:OTCFF) has confirmed that its name change to Kodiak Copper Corp will officially take place on Wednesday, April 1.
In a statement, the copper-focused resource group said it has now received all necessary approvals and shares under the new name will start trading on Toronto's Venture Exchange under the ticker symbol 'KDK' on that date.
The new shares have been consolidated on the basis of one new post-consolidation share for every five pre-consolidation shares.
Last month, when the name change and share split were announced, the firm also unveiled around a C$3 million share placing.
The firm said proceeds from the placing would be used to fund exploration on its wholly-owned, advanced-stage copper porphyry exploration projects in British Columbia and Arizona, and for general corporate purposes.
In a letter to shareholders last week, Dunnedin CEO Claudia Tornquist said 2019 was a transitional year for the group as it refocused to copper exploration from diamonds.
"We acquired two porphyry projects, MPD and Mohave, and together with our Trapper project now have a portfolio of three 100%-owned copper porphyry projects, all large scale and with immediate exploration upside," she told investors.
Tornquist said that over spring and summer of this year, the company was planning a bigger drill program at MPD to follow up on this initial success and will also start exploring the Mohave project.
The resource group also announced that it will host a webinar to launch Kodiak Copper and discuss its plans moving forward.
The webinar will take place on Thursday, April 2 at 11am PDT/2pm EDT. Management will be available to answer questions following the presentation.
