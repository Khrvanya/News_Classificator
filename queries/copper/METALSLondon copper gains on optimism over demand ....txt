SINGAPORE, May 28 (Reuters) - London copper prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by hopes that stimulus measures will boost demand as more economies reopened after months of lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose 1.2% to $5,320 a tonne by 0707 GMT, while the most-traded July copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange eased 0.3% to 43,700 yuan ($6,109.24) a tonne.
“LME base metals gained ...as measures to support the economies offset the negative impact of heightened geopolitical tension,” Anna Stablum, a commodities broker at Marex Spectron, said in a note.
South Korea’s central bank cut interest rates to a record low, and Japan approved a new $1.1 trillion stimulus package on Wednesday. In Australia, the economic downturn is likely to be less severe than had been thought.
However, risks remained, with tensions rising between the United States and China after Beijing proposed directly imposing national security legislation in Hong Kong. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the territory no longer qualified for its special status under U.S. law.
