Elmer B. Stewart, President and CEO of Copper Fox stated, “The restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed execution and completion of planned 2020 activities. During Q2 2020, work on the 2019 Schaft Creek Report of Activities by the Schaft Creek Joint Venture has progressed and the report is expected to be finalized mid-July. Other activities during Q2 2020, included completion of the updated resource estimate for the Van Dyke project as well as progress on the acquisition of the Eaglehead copper project with receipt of conditional approval from the TSX Venture Exchange as well as filing notices of planned Geological Field Operation Plans on its Arizona projects in anticipation of conducting limited field operations in 2020.”
Work continued on the 2019 Report of Activities for the Schaft Creek Joint Venture. The report is expected to be completed during the Q3 2020 (see News Release dated June 19, 2020).
The Company entered into a property sales agreement with District, where District has agreed to sell to Northern Fox, a wholly owned subsidiary of Copper Fox, all of its rights, title and interest in its Eaglehead copper project located in the Liard Mining Division of northern British Columbia.
The updated resource estimate for the Van Dyke project resulted in classifying a significant portion of the resource as Indicated, a significant increase in soluble copper metal and higher soluble copper recoveries for the Van Dyke deposit.
Copper Fox closed its non-brokered private placement, to raise up to $1,800,000 in gross proceeds. The Offering raised gross proceeds of $1,723,240 through the sale of 28,720,669 units (a “Unit”) at a price of $0.06 per Unit. Each Unit consisted of one common share and one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share for an exercise price of $0.09 during the 36-month period after the closing of the Offering and $0.12 during the 12-month period thereafter. If the 20-day volume weighted average price of the common shares listed on the TSX Venture Exchange is above $0.15, the expiry date of the Warrants will be accelerated to a date that is 30 days after the first date such threshold is met.
Subsequent to the Period Ended:
