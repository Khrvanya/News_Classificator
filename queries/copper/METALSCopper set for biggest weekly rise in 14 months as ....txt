LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - Copper prices were set for their biggest weekly gain in more than a year after signs that the spread of the coronavirus may be slowing lifted risk assets.
Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) — which is closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holidays — was up 0.2% at $5,010 a tonne at 1730 GMT and 3.5% higher this week, the most in any week since February 2019.
Copper, used in power and construction, has had a torrid two years as a U.S.-China trade war, slowing global economic growth and the coronavirus outbreak pushed prices down from more than $7,000.
“Copper is moving pretty much in lock step with the S&P 500 stock index,” said Nitesh Shah, an analyst at WisdomTree, but warned that a rebound in copper consumption would be slow and prices would remain under pressure.
LME cash copper is expected to average $4,700 a tonne in the second quarter and $5,200 over the full year, according to a Reuters poll of 23 analysts, which also forecast a 337,000-tonne surplus this year.
CORONAVIRUS: Mainland China this week reported a drop in new coronavirus cases, and new infections in Italy and hard-hit parts of the United States slowed.
MARKETS: Global equities rose as governments promised more stimulus measures, and despite data showing 6.6 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits. Oil prices rose on hopes of output cuts and the dollar fell.
CHINA: China’s new bank loans are expected to have rebounded in March as policymakers urge lenders to help cash-strapped companies.
CHINA PREMIUMS: Yangshan copper import premiums have risen to $76 a tonne, the highest since November, in part due to hopes of a value-added tax cut that have lifted near-dated Chinese copper futures. SMM-CUYP-CN
DEMAND: Analysts at ANZ said copper demand would fall nearly 3.5% to below 23 million tonnes this year and prices would average below $5,000 for the rest of 2020.
“Production cost is a reasonable guide to the price floor, but this is falling due to lower oil prices ... we see the downside protected near $4,000 a tonne,” they said.
SUPPLY: Australia-based miner MMG Ltd became the latest miner to report supply disruption, declaring force majeure on copper concentrate supplies from its Las Bambas mine in Peru, sources said.
BHP confirmed on Thursday two cases of coronavirus at its Escondida copper mine in Chile. Chile’s Codelco said its production continued in line with its plans.
STOCKS: Copper inventories in LME-registered warehouses rose 20% this week to 260,275 tonnes, the highest since October, and the discount of cash metal over the three-month contract leapt to $26.75 from $14 on Monday, suggesting plentiful nearby supply. MCU0-3 MCUSTX-TOTAL
