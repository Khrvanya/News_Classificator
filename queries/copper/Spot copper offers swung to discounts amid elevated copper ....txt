Offers of spot copper cathode fell to discounts on the morning of Monday June 8 as a continued rally in copper futures sidelined downstream consumers while sellers remained keen to destock.Â Amid sluggish trades and ample supplies in the market, sellers cut offers to a discount of 20-10 yuan/mt for standard-grade copper, against the SHFE June contract. Offers of high-grade copper fell to a discount of 10 yuan/mt. These compared with premiums as high as 20 yuan/mt in early trades this morning.
