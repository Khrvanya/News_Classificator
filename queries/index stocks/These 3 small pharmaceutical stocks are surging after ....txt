Here's how much each company gained.
Amid a rout that has sent global stocks and oil prices lower,  three pharmaceutical companies saw outsize gains on Monday  because of China's coronavirus outbreak.
Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna, and Novavax surged as  the Wuhan coronavirus spread further. The companies continued  rallies that were sparked on Thursday when the Coalition for  Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a public-private nonprofit  based in Norway, announced that it would provide as much as $11 million in funding to Inovio and Moderna to develop  vaccines against the coronavirus.
As of Monday, the virus, which was first identified in Wuhan,  China, had killed at least 81 people and infected more than 2,700  others amid fears of a global outbreak. There are no vaccines or  treatments for the virus, officially called 2019-nCoV. It's similar to the virus that caused severe acute respiratory  syndrome, or SARS, which incited global panic during a 2003  outbreak.
While some of the experimental vaccines the pharma companies are  working on to target the Wuhan virus could be ready for human  testing in a few months, approval for widespread use will take  much longer, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday .
Here's how much each company gained on Monday and how much each  stock has rallied since Thursday, from the lowest to the highest  gain.
