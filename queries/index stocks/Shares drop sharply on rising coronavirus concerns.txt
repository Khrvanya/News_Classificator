Panic has spread further after China's health minister Ma Xiaowei said people were infectious during an incubation period when they could show no symptoms.
However, the US Centres for Disease Control said there was not "any clear evidence" that had occurred, although it was possible.
The rapid rise in deaths and infections over the past few days saw the Dow Jones index drop more than 500 points at one point on fears about the impact of the virus on the global economy.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 cost the global economy $US40 billion.
The Dow finished down 1.5 per cent, or 453 points, at 28,536.
The Nasdaq lost 1.9 per cent to close at 9,139 and the S&P 500 fell 1.6 per cent to 3,244.
ASX SPI futures -1.3pc at 6,913, ASX 200 (Friday's close) 7,091
US: Dow Jones -1.6pc at 28,536, S&P 500 -1.6pc at 3,244, Nasdaq -1.9pc at 9,139
Europe: FTSE 100 -2.3pc at 7,412, DAX -2.7pc at 13,205, CAC -2.7pc at 5,863, Euro Stoxx 50 -2.7pc at 3,678

Travel firms, hotel companies and other stocks exposed to China led the falls on Wall Street.
American Airlines lost more than 5 per cent; casino firms took a tumble, with Wynn Resorts fallen almost 8 per cent; and cruise company Carnival lost 4.5 per cent.
A similar pattern was also in evidence locally, with Qantas among the biggest declines falling 5.2 per cent in early trade, while Crown Resorts was down 4.5 per cent.
Wall Street analysts also issued warnings about retailers, restaurants and hotels that get revenue from China.
Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti estimated Estee Lauder and Nike make 17 per cent of their revenue from mainland China each year.
"China is now a much bigger input to revenue/EPS for global brands," Mr Binetti said.
He said the impact on retailers could be worse than the SARS outbreak.
Consumer stocks such as Nike, Apple and Disney all dropped.
In Australia, retailers such as JB Hi-Fi (1.4 per cent), Harvey Norman (2.6 per cent) and Myer (4.4 per cent) were suffering declines.
Citi said US hotel companies that have "significant" exposure to China include Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt Hotels.
McDonald's, Starbucks and Yum China have all shut down some of their stores in China in response to the outbreak.
Australia's major banks were also down between 1-2 per cent on fears about the broader economic fallout from coronavirus and China's dramatic attempts to contain it.
The VIX index, a key measure of volatility, jumped to 18.23, up by 25 per cent.
Oil producers Chevron and BP also fell on worries about global growth because of the virus, as did local oil and gas firm Woodside, which lost 3.1 per cent.
Brent crude lost around 3 per cent and spot gold rose to $US1,580 an ounce as investors looked for safe havens.
Chinese authorities announced the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets will remain closed until next Monday after they extended the Lunar New Year holiday by three days.
Concerns about disruptions to Chinese industry also prompted a big sell-off for the major miners, with Fortescue down 7.6 per cent, Rio Tinto 3.6 per cent and BHP 3.7 per cent in early afternoon trade.
The Chinese currency, the yuan, also fell in offshore trade by the most since December.
Hong Kong's financial markets are due to reopen tomorrow.
Markets also slumped in Europe with the FT100 in London losing more than 2 per cent.
The Australian dollar dropped 1 per cent on the global jitters to 67.60 US cents.
