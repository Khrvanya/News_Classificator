U.S. stock-index futures added to earlier gains after the Labor Department issued a report showing that the U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April and the unemployment rate soared to 14.7%, though the data came in better than expected. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average YMM20 rose 241 points, or 1%, to about 24,058, those for the S&P 500 index ESM20 gained 27 points, or 1% to trade around 2,907 and Nasdaq-100 futures NQM20 were up 73 points, or 0.8%. Job losses came in less than feared, with economists surveyed by MarketWatch expecting 22.1 million jobs lost and an unemployment rate of 15.2%.
