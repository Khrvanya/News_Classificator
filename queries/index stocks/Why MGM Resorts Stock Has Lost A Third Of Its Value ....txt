MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) has a highly leveraged balance sheet with a long-term debt nearly twice the company’s market capitalization - much higher than that for its peers, Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts. As the coronavirus crisis has lowered revenue growth expectations, MGM Resorts’ stock tanked from the growing pile of long-term obligations despite the multiple sale-leaseback transactions last year. As a result, the stock is down from $27 at the beginning of 2017 to below $18 now despite revenues soaring 35% over the same period.

Over the last three years, MGM Resorts has expanded its Regional and International presence
In 2018, MGM Resorts augmented its presence in Macau with another venue, MGM Cotai, and doubled its gaming arena, including tables and slots. Regionally, the company also expanded its presence outside Las Vegas with prominent venues including MGM Springfield in Massachusetts and Empire City Casino in New York. Therefore, the growing geographical diversity swelled the company’s long-term obligations (debt and operating leases) by 20% from $12.7 billion in 2017 to $15.2 billion in 2019. While the long-term debt now stands at $11 billion (lower than 2017), rental obligations associated with sale-leaseback transactions will continue to weigh on margins over the coming months - especially in light of the expected pressure on revenues.
