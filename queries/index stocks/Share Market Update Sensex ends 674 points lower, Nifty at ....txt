- The adverse effects on several sectors are already visible as most companies have shut their plants and wherever possible are allowing employees to work from home (WFH). Our calculations suggest that only 30-40% of the economy is currently operational at different intensities.
- A single day of complete national lockdown could shave off as much as 14-19 basis points (bp) from annual growth and 55-75bp from quarterly growth. With 14 days of complete lockdown in Apr'20 and assuming that things normalize from mid-May'20, real GDP could decline 12.2% YoY in 1QFY21.
- This will be the first-ever quarter of de-growth since the quarterly data became available since late-1990s, and with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the Indian economy could see its first technical recession since 1990s.
- We find that 20% of the economy ('Manufacturing', 'Hotels & restaurants', and 'Water/Air transport') is severely affected at this stage. Around half (48%) of the economy ('Agriculture', Construction', 'Railways', 'Business services', 'Education' and 'Other services') is moderately affected and the remaining 32% is only mildly affected at this stage. Accordingly, the economic effect at this stage is 'moderate.'

BusinessToday.In brings you a daily tracker as coronavirus cases continue to spread. Here is the state-wise data on total cases, fatalities and recoveries in one comprehensive graphic
- Leading global capital goods manufacturers have partially shut factories amidst Covid-19 led lockdown and weakening demand. Global supply chains are also getting impacted.
- Our coverage universe of L&T, Siemens and ABB have strong balance sheets and are well placed to endure these tough times. Players like Siemens, ABB etc have global supply chains and factories the demand has shrunk, while the supply chain is also moderately stressed. The turnaround time to normalcy may be quick in case of EPC players like L&T, as large part of the migrant labor force is still at site and reliance on global supply chain is limited.
- KEC and Kalpataru Power have large overseas presence with 40/45% ex-India order book. Dependence on India supply chain may impact overseas execution as 80-90% supply chain resides within India.
- The brokerage kept 'Buy' rating for L&T, KEC and Kalpataru Power
- The brokerage kept 'Add' rating for Seimens and ABB India.
- Amazon's and Walmart's resilient systems must have again caught the eyes of enterprises across the globe and once the dust settles other firms will look to emulate these best practices.
- While some loss of revenue will be visible in Q4FY20, majority of the impact of the Coronavirus crisis will be felt in H1FY21.
- The obvious short-term shock to revenue notwithstanding, we believe the depreciating INR may ameliorate some pain;
- We believe the current crisis will put the adoption of digital transformation practices on an accelerated path.
- Uncertainty about demand environment compels us to cut short-term growth forecasts for FY21.
- Maintain 'BUY' on Infosys, HCL Tech & Tech Mahindra
-'HOLD' on TCS & Wipro.
- Indian IT growth in FY21 could be ~3% lower, assuming recovery in H2FY21 (thus, no immediate reduction in head-count).
- Companies have responded by moving 90% delivery home, resulting in ~5% loss in productivity days.
- We reduce our FY21/FY22 EBIT estimates ~14%/9% ,but keep our target multiples unchanged for most, barring where leverage/size may lead to higher risks. The sector, overall, has shown some resilience since 1st Feb
- We expect the sector to remain defensive. Top picks: Mphasis, LTI.
- Oil demand to plunge 17%, GRMs negative as COVID-19 bites: Global oil demand is poised to plunge approx 17% YoY in April 2020 and 6% during CY20 as COVID-19 lockdowns impact at least a quarter of the world's population.
- The trend in India is similar with modest refinery cutbacks ranging from 10-30%. We believe our recent 12-21% cut in FY21E EPS of OMCs is currently adequate.
- We believe Indian refineries will structurally gain in the long term as they enhance competitiveness. Our OMC pecking order is BPCL, HPCL and IOCL.
- While the CoVid-19 situation remains fluid, we believe that Nifty correction of ~30% already factors in the impact of ~1 month lockdown and return to business normalcy by Q1 end.
- While government and RBI have announced stimulus packages, we expect further measures to tide over the crisis.
- However, if the lockdown is more severe and the business impact extends well into 2Q, we see further downsides.
- Recent sharp correction presents attractive opportunity for long term investing into high quality names.
- Our key picks include: Infosys, Bharti, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, ITC, UNSP, UTCEM, IGL, CDSL, CIFC.
- Both companies in expansion mode after a 5-year pause; growth outlook likely to see downward revision
- Operations improved on the back of better realisations:
-COVID-19 has proven to be the proverbial black swan for Indian airlines with the impact spreading from smaller international (25% of revenue) to a suspension of domestic operations till April 15.
- In the event of a full shutdown, while we estimate Indigo, with reserves, to sustain cash burn for a year, Spicejet (SJ), even post the Boeing refund, will need a bailout.
- According to press reports, the government is mulling a relief package for airlines, similar to plans announced in US and Europe.
- Factoring this, we cut FY21/22E EBITDAR 34%/18% for Indigo and 33%/6% for SpiceJet.
- Maintain 'BUY' on SpiceJet with revised price of Rs 79 as against Rs 120 earlier.
