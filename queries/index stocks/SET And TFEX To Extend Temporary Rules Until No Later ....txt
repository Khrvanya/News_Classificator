The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) will prolong its recent trading rule amendments, which are short-selling and ceiling & floor, until September 30, 2020, or before, (from June 30 previously) due to continued market volatility as well as uncertain global economy and the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Likewise, Thailand Futures Exchangeâ€™s (TFEX) daily price limit rule will be extended to the same effective end date. The period extension has already undergone the hearing from stakeholders and has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The short-selling rule has lately been tightened by allowing investors to trade only at the price higher than the last trading price (uptick), while ceiling & floor rule has been adjusted to +/- 15% from +/- 30%, in order to mitigate market disturbance caused by COVID-19 crisis.
Meanwhile, TFEX has recently announced the amended rule of daily price limit of SET50 Index Futures, SET50 Index Options, Sector Futures, and Single Stock Futures to +/- 15% from +/- 30% of the latest settlement price to be in line with underlying assets.
(no longer than Sept 30, 2020)
