The report expects the average price of the stocks, except for Zee Entertainment, to go down even in the best-case scenario. All these stocks are still down by over 30% so far this year on the National Stock Exchange.
Avenue Supermarts, the biggest contender among the stocks that are being seen as the likely replacements, so far does not have a Futures & Options contract. “As of now, DMart (Avenue Supermarts) is not part of F&O segment. If it does not get included in F&O, then it will not be added to the Nifty. In such a scenario, despite being the largest among the replacement pool, it will not be a part of the Nifty,” the report said. However, the possibility of DMart getting an F&O contract in the next couple of months can not be ruled out.
Divi’s Laboratories, HDFC Life, Dabur, and SBI Life are all included in the F&O segment. ICICI Direct, however, pointed out that Dabur and SBI Life are both almost at par, paving the way for stiff competition among the two scrips. The combined weight of likely replacement stocks is likely to be 2.9% in the Nifty against outgoing stock weightage of just 1.5%.
The rebalancing, which ICICI Direct thinks is one of the biggest in recent history could also see the pharma and FMCG sector increase their cumulative weightage on the index while that of the automobile, telecom, metals is likely to fall. The media sector’s weightage will be entirely wiped out with Zee Entertainment exiting the index.
