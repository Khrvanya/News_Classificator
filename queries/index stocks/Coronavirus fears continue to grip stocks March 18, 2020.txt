As the coronavirus crisis keeps markets in a chokehold, liquidity has gotten tight.
US Treasury bonds are normally the most liquid asset in the world, meaning they  can be converted into cash so quickly that they are cash-like. Under normal circumstances, Treasuries are "the gold standard for liquidity," said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management.
But things look quite a bit different in the new coronavirus normal:
"The demand for cash is causing investors to sell their Treasuries," Bellows said.
In line with that, the 10-year Treasury bond headed lower on Wednesday, with its yield moving back above 1.1%. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions to each other.
The sold Treasuries then pile up on the balance sheets of broker dealers, which is what is draining the liquidity from the market, Bellows said.
This is where the Federal Reserve's bond purchases to unclog the financial system comes in.
"The risks are to the upside here. The Fed can and will do more as the need for cash increases," Bellows added.
