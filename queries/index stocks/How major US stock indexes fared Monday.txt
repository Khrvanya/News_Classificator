Stocks closed broadly higher on Wall Street Monday, clawing back half of their losses from last week.
A wobbly start led way to a rally after a much healthier-than-expected report on housing market. Among big-name companies, Boeing and Apple did especially well.
Stocks of smaller companies jumped more than the rest of the market. Treasury yields were mixed and oil prices rose.
