‘As much as I hope we’ll have a rapid recovery where America swiftly gets back to normal, it’s tough to bet on it’
Time to tweak this index.
The index, which was up almost 5% as of Tuesday’s close, has lagged behind the major benchmarks amid the stock market’s big rebound. But Cramer isn’t so sure that will last.
“The market’s gotten more confident that we’ll have a speedy, V-shaped recovery ... and that makes the recession stocks less attractive,” the “Mad Money” host said on Tuesday . “But, I’ve got to tell you, I think it’s too soon to give up on the recession stocks. As much as I hope we’ll have a rapid recovery where America swiftly gets back to normal, it’s tough to bet on it.”
With that in mind, Cramer swapped 10 of the 100 stocks in the index for 10 new additions “that are better suited to this moment and more relevant,” he said. “I want to keep most of our defensive exposure. You don’t want to get rid of it all. You need to be protected in case something goes wrong.”
