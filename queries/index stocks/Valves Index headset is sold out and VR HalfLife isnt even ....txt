The company is hoping to get it back in stock beforeÂ 'Half-Life: Alyx' comes out.
Valve's Index VR headset is sold out in most regions where it's officially available, and just a few months before Half-Life: Alyx comes out. According to RoadtoVR , which checked its availability across 31 countries, you can only get a unit in Japan at the moment. Even then, you can only buy the headset or the headset with controllers bundle: the full kit with base stations is also sold out in the Asian country. On the headset's official page , the developer notes that it's "busy catching up with the demand" for the device.
Valve has added a "Notify Me" button on its page, and clicking it takes you to portal where you can choose to be notified about the availability of various Index products and bundles.
A spokesperson told RoadtoVR: "We are working hard to build more units and meet the high demand. We are targeting to be back in stock before Half-Life: Alyx ships." The full-length VR entry to the company's first-person shooter franchise is scheduled for release in March 2020. While it will work with other PC-compatible VR headsets, Valve promised that Index owners will get a copy for free.
