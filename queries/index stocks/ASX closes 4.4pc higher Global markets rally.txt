Ardent Leisure has withdrawn its 2020 financial year guidance for Main Event as the coronavirus weighs on its operations.
"The growing uncertainty of COVID-19 has resulted in the reduction in attendance and revenue at centres across the United States," the company said.
"As a result, Main Event no longer believes it will achieve the constant centre revenue growth of between 1.5 per cent - 2.5 per cent as previously stated. As a consequence, Main Event’s EBITDA margin is expected to be below the 20 per cent guidance previously issued."
Ardent added the impact of the outbreak for its theme parks was expected to be longer than initially feared.
"Given the uncertain nature and duration of COVID-19, it is not possible to provide any further meaningful guidance on the impact to the Group’s earnings for the remainder of FY20," it said.
