Join AS/COA’s Anti-Corruption Working Group and Control Risks for a discussion on the state of anti-corruption in Peru.
As Latin America’s anti-corruption wave appears to be losing steam, Peru is one of the few positive stories in the region, according to the 2020 Capacity to Combat Corruption (CCC) Index , co-developed by AS/COA and Control Risks. The continued progress in major anti-corruption investigations, as well as a strong commitment by President Martín Vizcarra to face the problem, have contributed to an increase in Peru’s score since 2019. However, enormous challenges still lie ahead for the country, from building stronger law enforcement agencies and courts to reforming its political system. What are the risks to Peru’s anti-corruption push? How is it changing the political and business environment in the country?
The program will be livestreamed on this page on Tuesday, June 30 at 10:00 a.m. ET. You can submit a question during the event via Twitter using the hashtag #CCCIndex , as well as via YouTube or Livestream .
