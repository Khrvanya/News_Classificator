The USG + U.S. Chamber of Commerce Commercial Construction Index (CCI) is a quarterly economic index designed to gauge the outlook for, and resulting confidence in, the commercial construction industry.
Recognizing a need to highlight the important contributions of this sector to the nation’s economy, USG Corporation and the U.S. Chamber partnered to produce this first-of-its-kind index.
Each quarter, contractors across the country are surveyed in order to better understand their levels of confidence in the industry and top-of-mind concerns.
The Commercial Construction Index (CCI) rebounded in Q1 2020 to 74, up three points from an all-time low of 71 last quarter.
The ratio of current/optimal backlog remained constant at 76, the same as the previous quarter. The average optimal backlog was 12.7 months, up 4% from Q4 2019, but the actual backlog was also up 4% keeping the ratio stable.
The measure of expectation for revenue in the next 12 months increased to 70 in Q1, up from 66 in Q4 2019.
The confidence in the market’s ability to provide new business opportunities rose to 76 in Q1, up from 72 in Q4 2019.
