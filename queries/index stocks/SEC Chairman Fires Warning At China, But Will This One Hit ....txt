Rubio and others in the Senate have tried to get the Thrift Savings Plan, a government pension fund, not to use an MSCI Emerging Markets Index that includes massive weighting to China. They haven’t been able to convince TSP to change their minds in allocating to the world’s No. 2 economy.
The SEC’s note yesterday, warning investors of the risks of investing in emerging markets more broadly isn’t a step in banning indexes from including China.
“We don't want to deny (investors) access,” Clayton says. “But what we do want them to understand is that the risks are different.”
If the pandemic leads to hardened relations between the U.S. and China, there is nothing stopping the SEC from demanding Chinese — and any other foreign company listed in the U.S. — abide by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Act was created in the aftermath of the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. Those that don’t comply, can’t be listed, perhaps. That doesn’t seem like a radical, or far stretch to take with China or any other country housing corporations with listed ADRs on the NYSE and Nasdaq
Chris Iacovella, CEO of the American Securities Association, a group representing small investors, praised Clayton for sounding the alarm again. Iacovella has been sounding it for at least a year now.
“The SEC can prioritize investor protection by closing the passive index loophole that fund issuers and index providers use to funnel American investor and retirement saver dollars to China, because no one knows how many of these companies are frauds,” he says.
The SEC has been complaining about China’s lack of audit visibility for years.
