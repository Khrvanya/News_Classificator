The US stock market plunged as much as 7% immediately after regular trading began on Monday, prompting the first halt since the depths of the financial crisis in December 2008.

The three major US indexes declined as equities investors digested the weekend's oil-market news. The commodity tanked the most since 1991 on Monday morning after Saudi Arabia's surprise price cuts kicked off a production war with Russia.
