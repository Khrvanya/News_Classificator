The ASX 200 closed 1.5 per cent higher at 5904.1, adding $26bn to the market cap
Bain Capital has agreed to buy Virgin Australia, and plans to help it "re-establish itself as an iconic Australian airline"
A bank-inspired rebound added $26 billion to the Australian sharemarket on Friday but the rally wasn’t quite enough for the benchmark index to finish a volatile week in the black.
The ASX finished the week down 0.6 per cent after trimming losses on Friday.
The S&P/ASX 200 gained 86.4 points, or 1.5 per cent, in the final session of the week to close at 5904.1. Overnight joy from Wall Street spilled into the Asian session after US regulators dropped a major pressure test for the banks.
That move momentarily wiped away mounting concerns of a second coronavirus wave - as well as weak jobs figures - to drive US financials and the benchmark S&P 500 index sharply higher.
Locally, the big four banks followed suit, led by a 3.3 per cent gain for Westpac to $17.99.
Commonwealth Bank added 2.4 per cent to $69.27, ANZ rose 3 per cent to $18.80, and NAB gained 2.7 per cent to $18.40.
The big miners also piled on gains with BHP rising 2.9 per cent to $36.05, Rio Tinto 2 per cent to $98.99, and Fortescue Metals 2.2 per cent to $14.18.
It wasn't enough, however, to wipe Thursday’s heavy losses completely from the board.
Despite finishing four of the past five sessions ahead, the ASX 200 closed the week 0.6 per cent lower.
There were 156 companies higher and 37 lower on Friday, with Qantas the worst of the bunch. The national airline shed 9.1 per cent to $3.81 after resuming trade following its $1.36 billion institutional placement.
Energy stocks closed 2 per cent higher after an oil price rebound and property stocks added 1.5 per cent for the session.
Woolworths and Coles gained 0.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively after announcing they would be reinstating purchasing limits on toilet paper.
Blood giant CSL weighed the health sector down with a 0.4 per cent decline to $292.74.
The United States’ handling of the coronavirus resurgence may be stealing global headlines, but Australia was also battling its COVID worries on Friday as Victoria announced another 30 cases, bringing the state’s current active total to 183.
GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller said there was also plenty else to keep investors on their toes.
“There’s the pandemic of course, and the concerning acceleration in cases we’re seeing… but in my opinion, the markets are still at reasonably elevated levels, given the risk backdrop,” Mr Miller said.
“I’m talking about the geopolitical stuff, the trade stuff that is in the background. Markets have a very strong faith in central banks and governments that they have gotten this stuff right.”
Also on Friday’s ‘cons’ side of the ledger were reports Australia's deficit ballooned to nearly $65 billion in May, with revenues plummeting and spending skyrocketing in response to the pandemic.
