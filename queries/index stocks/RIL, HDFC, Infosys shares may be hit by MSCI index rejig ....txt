Share Market LIVE: SGX Nifty signals muted start for Sensex, Nifty; Fitch cuts India growth projection for FY22
Reliance Industries, India’s largest company in terms of market capitalization on the S&P BSE Sensex, has been assigned 11.36% weightage on MSCI India, as on March 31. HDFC, the second largest constituent on the MSCI India, has been assigned 9.58% weightage, while Infosys is at 7.81%.
The change in India’s weightage on the index, according to Morgan Stanley, will result in passive inflows of over $1.4 billion (about Rs 10,000 crore) and active inflows of $5.7 billion (about Rs 43,000 crore). With foreign funds to the tune of Rs 1.1 lakh crore exiting the Indian share market in March alone — owing to a global sell-off aided by the coronavirus pandemic — the likely inflow of billions of dollars could prove fruitful in reviving the market sentiment.
The decision to increase FPI limit for listed entities was made public by CDSL and NSDL, on friday last week. The decision was a follow-up on the announcement made by the Finance Ministry in October last year. Earlier last week, MSCI in a press release announced its decision to defer the rebalancing of India’s weightage, owing to the lack of company level foreign limit data. Morgan Stanley said that the rebalancing of India’s weightage could be taken up by MSCI in a few months now that the FPI limits have been rejigged.
