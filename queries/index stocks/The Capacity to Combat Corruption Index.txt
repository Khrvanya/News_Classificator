Our first annual #CCCindex, developed w/@Control_Risks, looks at 8 Latin American countries' ability to combat corruption along 3 dimensions: 1) legal capacity, 2) institutions, and 3) civil society, media, and the private sector.  Read the report.
6.66 = Chile 6.14 = Brazil 5.36 = Colombia. Check out why these three countries have the highest corruption-fighting abilities of the eight Latin American countries evaluated in our new #CCCindex.
Which countries in Latin America are best prepared to fight corruption? How are governments, media, civil society, and the private sector fostering—or standing in the way of—a cleaner business environment?
To help answer these questions, AS/COA and the risk consulting firm Control Risks are launching the Capacity to Combat Corruption (CCC) Index, a new tool assessing Latin America’s ability to uncover, punish, and deter corruption.
Rather than measuring perceived levels of corruption, the CCC Index evaluates and ranks countries based on how effectively they are able to combat corruption. Countries with a higher score are deemed more likely to see corrupt actors prosecuted and punished.
