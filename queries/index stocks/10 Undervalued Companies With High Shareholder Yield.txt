There are two ways companies can put money back in shareholders' pockets: by paying a dividend or buying back shares of their common stock. From a shareholder's perspective, which is better?
Investors have long cherished dividends because they provide steady income. After all, "[A bird] in the hand is worth the whole arithmetic in the bush," as Hetty Green once quipped. And assuming the company pays a qualified dividend, which most U.S. companies do, the income is taxed at a preferred rate--investors in the highest tax bracket will pay 20%, while investors in the middle brackets will pay 15%, and investors in the bottom two tax brackets will not owe any income tax on dividend income.
