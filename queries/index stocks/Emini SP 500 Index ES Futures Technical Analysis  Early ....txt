Additionally, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar warned on Sunday that the “window is closing” for the U.S. to curb the coronavirus outbreak.

Early in the session on Monday, buyers showed some respect for the 50% level at 2986.00, mounting their turnaround after touching 2983.50. We’re going to be watching the 2986.00 to 2983.50 area throughout the session as we move toward the cash market opening.
A sustained move over 2986.00 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this move can create enough upside momentum throughout the session, then look for the intraday rally to possibly extend into 3072.25. That’s the nearest resistance.
The inability to even approach 3072.25 will indicate the buying is getting weaker, or the selling pressure stronger.
Crossing to the weak side of the 50% level at 2986.00 will signal the presence of sellers. Taking out the intraday low at 2983.50 could trigger an acceleration into the next support cluster at 2926.25 to 2923.75.
