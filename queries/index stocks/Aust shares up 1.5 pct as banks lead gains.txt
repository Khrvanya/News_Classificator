The Australian share market has rebounded from Thursday's plunge, with the financial sector leading the charge after the easing of some regulations for American banks.
The S&P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Friday up 86.4 points, or 1.49 per cent, at 5,904.1 points, while the All Ordinaries index was up 83.8 points, or 1.41 per cent higher, at 6,011.8.
"A good strong day for the Australian market, and it's pretty clear that the most important factor here and around the globe is sentiment," said CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy.
That sentiment turned positive after the US Federal Reserve eased capital requirements on banks while ordering them to suspend share buyback programs and keep dividend payments at current levels.
"I think that investors have taken that to mean the Fed is willing to do whatever is needed to support economies and markets," Mr McCarthy said.
