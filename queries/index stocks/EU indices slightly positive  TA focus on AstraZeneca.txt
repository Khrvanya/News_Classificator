Smiths Group, a diversified engineering group, released a trading update: "For the ten months ended 31 May 2020, underlying revenue for Continuing Operations was up +2%. (...) For the four months of the second half ended 31 May 2020, underlying revenue was up +1%. (...) The resilient overall performance of the last four months reflects the momentum of the first half and our strong orderbooks at the outset of the COVID-19 crisis. (...) The Group announces today a strategic restructuring programme (...) The programme is Group-wide and has an operating cash cost of c.£65m which will be spread across FY2020 and FY2021. Savings will substantially offset costs in FY2021 and deliver the full annualised benefit of approximatively £70m from FY2022 onwards."
