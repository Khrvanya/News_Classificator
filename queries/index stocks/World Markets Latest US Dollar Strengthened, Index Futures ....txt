The financial markets are very unstable right now. The coronavirus pandemic is having a bad effect on the global economy. There is very little activity taking place. Thus, people are facing many problems. Many countries are in lockdown right now. Due to this, many companies are not earning any money right now. Therefore, investor confidence in stock markets is also low.
But, the markets have not always been going down. During the pandemic, people are seeing that the market has also risen on a few days. This has been happening because people get optimistic if they think the lockdown is going to end, or the government is going to reduce the restrictions. This is reducing investor confidence even more because they do not like to invest in volatile markets.

Its economy is among those suffering the most. The rise, however, comes because many investors are trying to protect the US dollars. They are worried about the USâ€™s ability to recover from the pandemic, and the rise is to protect the dollar against other currencies.
