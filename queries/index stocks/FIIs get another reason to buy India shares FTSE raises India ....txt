Taking note of the increased foreign investment limits for public listed companies in India, FTSE Russell has decided to rejig the investability weighting of its Indian constituents, which will see India’s weightage increase in the headline FTSE global indices. The move could see foreign investors rush to invest in Indian stocks, resulting in healthy inflows for the stock markets. FTSE could soon be joined by MSCI ( Morgan Stanley Capital Investment) in changing India’s weightage on its global indices, a move that according to Morgan Stanley research could flood Indian stock markets with more than Rs 52,000 crore.
FTSE will look to change India’s weightage in the June 2020 quarterly review, effective from June 22, said FTSE in a press release. “Indian index constituents, with a headroom adjustment, which are impacted by this update, will have their respective FOL increased in two 50% tranches, subject to the headroom remaining at 20% or above, in accordance with Foreign Ownership Restriction and Minimum Headroom Requirement policy,” FTSE said. The projected change in weightage would see India’s weightage jump to 1.18% in the FTSE Global All Cap index, while the FTSE All World index is projected to see India’s weightage go up to 1.17%. On the emerging market index, India is projected to jump up by 1.43% to increase its weightage to 10.38%. FTSE Emerging All Cap index will see India’s weightage reach 10.56% from the current 9%.
