In  this article, we look at the long-term view of IBM which we believe  ended an Elliott Wave Grand Super Cycle from all time the low and is  currently correcting that cycle. We will look at the preferred structure  of the pull back, where we are within the correction, what is the swing  sequence suggesting and also highlight an area that could be interest  to the long-term investors. Lets start by taking a look at the  quarterly chart of IBM below.
Chart  below shows a complete 5 waves move up from its all time low when wave  (I) ended at 43.97 in 1987, wave (II) completed at 10.16 in 1993, wave  (III) completed at 139.19 in 1999 and wave (IV) completed at 54.01 in  2002, wave (V) was extended and completed at 215.90 in 2013. According  to Elliott Wave Theory , once a 5 waves move is complete, market should correct the 5 waves move and this corrective move could take different forms.
Chart  below is the weekly chart and provides a closer look at the structure  of correction which started way back in 2013. Initial decline from March  2013 peak to February 2016 low was a Zigzag Elliott wave structure.  This was followed by a 3 waves bounce to 182.79 (February 2017) after  which stock dropped below February 2016 low creating an incomplete  sequence against February 2017 peak.Stock then saw another recovery  which ended in February 2020 and we have now seen a breach of December  2018 low, if we count the number of swings down from blue (x) peak, we  can count 5 swings down and its not an impulse or a diagonal because  the biggest correction is in the middle. This means the swing sequence  down from blue (x) peak is incomplete and while below February 2020  peak, stock should ideally make another push lower to complete 7 swings  down from blue (x) peak. Ideal target area is between 82.73  59.15  which is 100  123.6% Fibonacci extension area of blue (w)-(x) cycles.  161.8 Fibonacci extension comes at 21.05 and as its a corrective  decline we would expect it to stay above this level and then stock would  have a chance to resume the rally in the next leg of the Grand Super  Cycle.
