NEW DELHI: As Nifty closed above the 10,750 level on Monday, it also formed higher high and low for the fifth straight session.
Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said Nifty has to hold above 10,600 level to extend its move towards 11,000 level while on the downside support has shifted higher to 10,550 and then 10,450 levels.
Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities said technically Nifty has kept on surpassing one resistance after the other. The 10,827-10,943 zone will be its next resistance now.
Ruchit Jain of Angel Broking said Nifty has approached resistance in the 10,800-11,000 zone, which coincides with the ‘200 SMA’ on the daily chart. “So far, there are no signs of any trend reversal and, hence, one should avoid taking any contra bet,” he said.
Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities says the market is receiving one or the other booster dose every day in terms of positive news flow, which has been keeping the bullish trend intact. “However, Nifty is leaving un-filled price gaps that would cause negativity in the near term. Stay stock specific for the time being and buy Nifty if it corrects to support levels, which exist at 10,700 and 10,650,” he said.
That said, here’s a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday’s market action:
Wall Street's major indexes climbed on Monday as data showing unexpected growth in the U.S. services sector last month and optimism over China's economic revival helped investors look past a surge in new cases of COVID-19 at home. At 7:48 pm (IST), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 322.73 points, or 1.25 per cent, at 26,150.09, the S&P 500 was up 41.08 points, or 1.31 per cent, at 3,171.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 187.95 points, or 1.84 per cent, at 10,395.58.
European shares headed towards a one-month high on Monday, with a rally in China's markets setting an upbeat tone as investors banked on the world's second biggest economy to lead a recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump. The pan-European STOXX 600 climbed 1.6 per cent, as stocks exposed to China, including carmakers, industrials , energy firms and luxury goods makers, gained strongly. The German DAX, London's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 all rose about 2 per cent.
Nifty50 on Monday climbed for the fourth session in a row and in the process breached 10,750 level on a closing basis. This was also the fifth consecutive session when the index formed higher high and low, suggesting that supports have shifted higher. That said, Monday was the third straight session when the index formed an indecisive candle.
India VIX fell 2.22 per cent to 25.19 level. A gradual decline in volatility, which is falling for last three consecutive weeks and also at lowest levels in last four months suggests an overall bullish stance. On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 10,000 level followed by 9,000, while maximum Call OI was at 11,500 followed by 11,000 levels. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 10,400 and 11,000 levels.
