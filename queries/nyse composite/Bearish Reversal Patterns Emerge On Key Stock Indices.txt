Bearish Reversal Patterns Emerge On Key Stock Indices!
Transportation Index, Russell 2000 Index NYSE Composite, and Mid Cap Index – “monthly” Price Charts
Today’s 4-pack chart looks at the long-term “monthly” charts of the Transports, Small Caps, Mid Caps, and the NYSE Composite.
Month-end (for June) was yesterday so these charts provide a clearer picture of the latest monthly price bars (and setups)… and, let’s just say “a picture says a 1000 words”!
As you can see, each of these important market cogs produced a monthly bearish reversal pattern at each (1).  The market may be sending an important message to investors here… especially if selling resumes in July. Stay tuned!
