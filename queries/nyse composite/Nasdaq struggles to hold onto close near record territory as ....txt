U.S. stocks Monday afternoon slipped off their highs of the session and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite drifted around a new closing record, after reports signaled that President Donald Trump was on the cusp of signing an executive order that could limit workers applying for a wide array of jobs in the U.S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA,
was up 0.4% at 3,108, off its Monday peak at 3,120.85, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP,
was trading 0.7% higher but off its intrasession peak at 10,057.27. If the Nasdaq finishes at a level above 10,020.35, it will mark a fresh closing record for the benchmark. The Trump order would introduce restrictions on skilled work visas used widely in the U.S. technology industry. The order could impact visa types, including H-1B, H-2B, and L-1 and would last until the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported . The action is being taken, the administration says, to focus hiring on domestic investors and away from workers outside of the U.S., as the domestic economy attempts to recover from worst pandemic in nearly 100 years.
Wearing a mask has become a uniquely hot-button issue in the U.S., which finds itself in the throes of viral pandemic that appears to be drifting out of control by the day.
