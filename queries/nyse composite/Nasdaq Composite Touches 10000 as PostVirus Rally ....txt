The Nasdaq Composite stock index briefly topped the 10000 milestone for the first time Tuesday, the latest sign of the resilience of the big technology companies that have powered the stock market over the past decade.
The index, which is dominated by Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc., has surged 45% since late March. Investors are increasingly betting those companies will emerge even stronger from the pandemic, taking the broader stock market along with them.
