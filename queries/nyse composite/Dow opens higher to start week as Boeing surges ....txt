Dow opens higher to start week as Boeing surges, highlighting shares staging coronavirus rebounds
U.S. stocks opened higher Monday, with New York , one of the hardest-hit cities by coronavirus, set to re-open, on the heels of a May employment report that showed that labor-market damage from lockdowns may not have been as longlasting as originally feared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA,
opened 8 points, 0.3%, higher, near 3,202. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP,
, which on Friday closed just 3.1 points shy of an earlier all-time high, opened near 9,823, up 9 points and 0.1%. Airline stocks and others that took the biggest hit during stay-home orders looked set to continue rallying: shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL,
also seemed to receive a boost from optimism emanating from the airline industry.
There will be very little useful guidance from U.S. corporations in the earnings reporting season starting mid-July on what the rest of 2020 will look like for the stock market and analysts are very divided on the outlook
