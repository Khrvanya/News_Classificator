Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma has warned that conflict between the world’s two largest economies could last 20 years, raising concerns about the toll that tensions would have on Alibaba and its core customers.
Yet the Hangzhou-based company managed to record 54% revenue growth, from 55.12 billion yuan ($8.00 billion) to 85.15 billion yuan ($12.40 billion), by adjusting its e-commerce formula and expanding into newer businesses like cloud computing. Alibaba owns and operates Taobao and Tmall, which hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Internet Retailer 2018 Online Marketplaces . It’s core commerce revenue from those and other sites grew 56% year over year, from 46.46 billion yuan ($6.75 billion) to 72.48 billion yuan ($10.55 billion).
The trade war is starting to hurt the Asian nation, depressing the consumer spending that the online giant relies on to drive much of its growth. Domestically, it’s grappling with a migration of smaller merchants to cheaper platforms such as JD.com Inc. (No. 5 in the Online Marketplaces) and Pinduoduo Inc., both backed by nemesis Tencent Holdings Ltd.
“China’s e-commerce sector will feel the drag of the economy slowdown even more next year,” said Steven Zhu, an analyst with Pacific Epoch. “Platforms like Pinduoduo are charging much lower in commissions, posing significant competition to Alibaba.”
Heightening the uncertainty, Chinese regulators are clamping down on the country’s internet sector, reining in everything from gaming apps and travel sites to ride-hailing. That’s exacerbating already slowing growth in Alibaba’s business. The Hangzhou-based company is trying to counter that by stepping up its marketing services and investing in its own grocery stores and delivery to boost sales.
