I am reviewing global stock market charts and data for our Technical Tuesday report to clients and wanted to share a “long” trading idea.
Here’s a “weekly” chart of the Nasdaq Composite.
The index tested down into its MFU-2 price target zone (based on the weekly time frame). The index also hit a MOB band of support and produced an Ellipse buy signal.
I believe the reward to risk zone for a long trade is favorable. I will use the recent low as a stop.
It’s a bit early for an upside target to get generated at this point, but I will share that once a move to the upside gets going.  Note much of this will depend on your timeframe. Note as well that this is a tactical trade and I fully expect a retest at some point.
