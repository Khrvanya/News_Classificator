"Investors will be pleased to see that October has started on a positive note with buyers coming to the market," Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based bitcoin and crypto exchange Luno, wrote in a note.
"There is a growing consensus that the recent loss in value was directly linked to the physical contracts being offered through Bakkt. As the cryptocurrency market develops, changes to structure or new products will always have the potential to upset the price, but this is all part of the growing process."
Bitcoin and cryptocurrency watchers had hoped Bakkt's launch, a much-hyped platform that boasts software giant Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks among its partners, would herald the next big leap higher for bitcoin.
Bakkt, owned by New York Stock Exchange parent company Intercontinental Exchange, allows traders and institutional investors to swap so-called "physically" settled bitcoin futures contracts, meaning traders and investors are not able to sell more bitcoin than they actually have.
The bitcoin price has added around $500 per bitcoin over the last few hours.
The bitcoin price has rallied hard so far this after a disastrous 2018, adding over 150% since January as some of the world's biggest technology companies eye bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain.
