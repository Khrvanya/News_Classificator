Litecoin continues on bearish run; Zcash and BAT follow suit
March was bad for all the cryptocurrencies coins while April was a relief as several altcoins recorded significant gains. Starting May, however, coins like Litecoin , Zcash , and BAT are on a downward run, and, as per the price indicators, they might continue the bearish run for a couple more days.
Litecoin, the seventh coin as per Coinmarketcap, had a wild run throughout April and has continued the same pattern in May as well. The coin after recording a major loss in the second week of April with the price reaching as low as $39, saw a rise by 13% on April 21; the coin saw another rise on April 30 by 13%. However, this bull run did not last long. The coin moved downwards since the start of May and experienced a 13.6% drop on May 9. By the looks of it, the coin might continue on its downtrend in the coming days as confirmed by the CMF indicator.
