Will LTC/ USD bears take charge?
On Tuesday, Litecoin rallied to an over four-week high at $49.90 yet the price pulled back later as some bulls seemed to cut back. Therefore, the weekly candlestick closed with a Doji candlestick reflecting the market’s indecision at this stage.
This week, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained flat above 50 highlighting a paused bullish momentum.

In late April, Litecoin failed to rally to the higher trading zone signaling that bulls were losing momentum. Later on, the price traded in a sideways move creating a set of lower highs with higher lows. Last week, the price rebounded around the high end of the current trading zone $35.92- $50.20 yet remained above the 50-day moving average,indicating that bulls may retake the initiative.
Hence, any successful close above the high end of the aforementioned trading zone may trigger a rally towards $60.20, and a further close above that level may extend the rally towards $74.55.
On the flip-side, any close below the 50-DMA signals that LTC/USD could fall towards the low end of the zone, and a further close below that level may send the price even lower towards $22.30.
That said, the daily and weekly support and resistance levels marked on the daily chart should be kept in focus in both scenarios.
