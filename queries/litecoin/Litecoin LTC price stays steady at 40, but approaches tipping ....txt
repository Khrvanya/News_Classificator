Similarly, David Smith has noted that the Litecoin LTC price has been rejected from the upper boundary, so retesting the lower boundary has become a possibility. However, the analyst has suggested that it would likely be a better option to trade the horizontal resistance, set at $41.60, or the horizontal support, set $39.20, whichever way the LTC price decides it wants to go.
Well, known analyst, Willy Woo has stated that, despite Bitcoin recently slipping over 40%, it has been a better safe-haven asset than stocks and even gold. In a tweet, the analyst posted a chart comparing the performance of gold, the S&P 500, and Bitcoin over the last five years. This is added to the list of other reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin.
