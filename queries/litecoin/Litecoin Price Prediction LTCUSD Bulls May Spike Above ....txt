Litecoin price remains in the strong hands of the bulls following a reversal from $40.80 to $43.96.
LTC/USD is just as bullish as the other major cryptocurrencies today. From an opening value of $41.59, the coin reversed a little bit to touch a $40.80 level. At the moment, LTC/USD has grown by 3.2% to trade at $43.96. The strongly bullish trend hints that buyers are just getting started. Looking at the daily chart, the Litecoin price has already crossed above the 9-day and 21-day moving averages.
However, the bullish action is supported by the technical indicator as the RSI (14) pushes towards 54-level, there is a possibility that $45 will only be stepping stone for the next rally eyeing $50. Meanwhile, initial support lies at $34, $32 and $30 levels.

Furthermore, any attempt by the buyers to re-power the market, the coin may likely cross above the moving averages to break out of the channel in order to reach the nearest resistance level at 6300 SAT and above. Meanwhile, the Litecoin price is currently changing hands to 5748 SAT.
