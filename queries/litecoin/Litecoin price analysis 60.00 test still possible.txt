Litecoin is starting to trade in a narrow price range around the $40.00 level as the cryptocurrency struggles to find a clear short-term directional bias.

Once above the $47.00 level, the LTC/USD pairâ€™s key 200-day moving average is key resistance, around the $52.00 level.
Looking at the downside, a sustained loss of the $37.00 level could prompt a test of the $33.00 and possibly the $30.00 support level.
