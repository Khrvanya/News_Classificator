The public Bitcoin fund was launched by 3iQ, the first investment fund management company in Canada, which is compliant with regulations of the country’s securities authorities. On the first day, the public bitcoin funds were sold at about $11 per share.
Meanwhile, the Canadian fund manager appointed Gemini, a digital currency exchange and custodian to manage the bitcoin funds. One of the founders, Tyler Winklevoss, confirmed the appointment in a tweet on the 9th of April.
Gurbacs said in a tweet that he is happy with the outcome of things. Bitcoin critics had claimed that Bitcoin is not a thing for Institutional traders. However, the recent development stands out as another evidence to prove that the deep-pocketed Investors are highly interested in BTC and its products.
In reiteration to Mike Novogratz’s statement earlier today, it’s evident that Bitcoin’s upcoming halving is going as predicted. Mainly, its current price actions are attracting new friends for the largest cryptocurrency. Apparently, among these new friends include institutional investors.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at the price of $7,542, according to the information on Coinmarketcap. It now has a total market capitalization above $138 billion.
