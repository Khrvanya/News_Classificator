Once again, Litecoin is exhibiting signs that it may have found a local bottom and is ready to target new highs.
According to one crypto analyst, Litecoin has just finished an ABC correction following a five-wave impulse upward. The analyst uses Elliott Wave Theory to predict future price movements in assets.
If this is the case, Litecoin would theoretically be ready for another five-wave impulse upward once again, this time setting another new local high, and potentially the first higher high since the crypto market bottomed in December 2018.
starting to think $ltc may have bottomed, am cautiously long, a break above $69 and id say the bottom is in and new highs on the cards and obviously if ltc bottomed it means corn did aswell.
