Crypto lender BlockFi has added support for USD Coin (USDC) and Litecoin (LTC) across all of its offerings.
Announced Wednesday, users of BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA) can now deposit these two currencies to either earn monthly compounding interest on them or take out U.S. dollar-denominated loans against the crypto collateral. The company offers an initial interest rate of 8.6% for USDC and 3.8% for LTC, according to a press statement shared with The Block.
The two coins were also added to BlockFiâ€™s new trading platform. Launched in Dec. 2019, BlockFi Trading allows users to trade between the following cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Gemini Dollar, and now, USDC and LTC.
BlockFi has seen significant growth since its founding in 2017. Its valuation doubled in a roughly two-month period, as The Block previously reported, and BlockFi founder Zac Prince said last month that the platform was seeing 1-2% daily growth across key performance indicators. BlockFi raised $18.3 million in a Series A funding round last summer.
Editor's Note: This report has been amended to clarify information about BlockFi's valuation.
