Many of the marketâ€™s altcoins recovered quickly following the crash in March, with most of them recording significant gains over the month of April. However, come the start of May, altcoins like Ethereum Classic , Litecoin , and Zcash have trended downwards. That being said, a closer look at the charts would suggest that these alts could be in for a bull rally over the next few weeks.
Ethereum Classic, as seen in the attached chart, had been trending downwards even before the market crash. However, following the 54% drop on the 12th of March, the coin has been doing fairly okay. Towards the end of April, the coin saw another rise worth 43%. Further, while the coin incurred a loss of 17% on 11 May, it quickly went on a bull rally.
The MACD indicator hinted at a potential bullish crossover, indicating a continuing bull run. Additionally, the widening Bollinger Bands hinted at increased volatility over the next few days.
