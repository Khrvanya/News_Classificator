It’s another bearish start to the day. While Litecoin managed to move back into the green, holding on could be a different story…
Bitcoin Cash ABC slid by 5.69% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 4.10% gain from Saturday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the week down by 23.8% to $202.44
A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early morning intraday high $214.66 to an early morning low $208.68.
Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested before partially recovering to $213 levels.
Going into the afternoon, the bearish sentiment ultimately weighed, however. Bitcoin Cash ABC tumbled to a late afternoon intraday low $201.00.
Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the first major support level at $205.61 before finding support.
Through the latter part of the day, Bitcoin Cash ABC found support to move back through to $206 levels before wrapping up the day at $202 levels.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 1.15% to $200.10. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early morning high $204.50 to a low $196.54.
Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the first major support level at $197.41
For the day ahead, a move through the morning high to $206 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $211.07 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin Cash ABC to break out from $200 levels.
Barring an early breakthrough to $206 levels, however, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely fall well short of $210 levels.
Failure to move through to $206 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC take another tumble. A fall back through the first major support level at $197.41 would bring the second major support level at $192.37 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer well clear of sub-$190 levels.
Litecoin slid by 8.91% on Sunday. Reversing a 1.64% gain from Saturday, Litecoin ended the week down 25.8% to $43.95.
A relatively bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall from an early morning intraday high $48.34 to a late morning low $46.54.

Litecoin fell back through the first major support level at $46.82 and the second major support level at $45.51.
Through the latter part of the day, Litecoin moved back through to $45 levels before a late pullback through the second major support level.
At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 0.52% to $44.18. A choppy start to the day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning high $45.36 before sliding to a low $42.63.
Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
For the day ahead, a move through the morning high $45.36 would bring the first major resistance level at $47.00 into play.
Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through to $46 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $45 would likely pin Litecoin back on the day.
Failure to move through the morning high could see Litecoin slide back into the red.
A fall through the morning low $42.63 would bring the first major support level at $42.24 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$42 levels on the day.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from the first major support level.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $0.23 would likely limit any upside on the day.
Failure to move through to $0.2260 levels could see Ripple’s XRP struggle throughout the day.
A fall back through the morning low $0.20256 would bring the second major support level at $0.2100 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.21 levels.
