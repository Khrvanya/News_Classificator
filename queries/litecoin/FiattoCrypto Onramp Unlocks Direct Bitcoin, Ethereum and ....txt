Celsius Network members on the go can now buy Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and other leading cryptocurrencies on their credit cards using the platform’s mobile app.
The crypto interest income platform has partnered with leading cryptocurrency payment processing firm Simplex to give consumers the ability to make BTC, ETH, LTC and other crypto purchases using credit and debit cards directly from the Celsius app for a fee of 3.5%.
Cryptocurrencies currently supported by Celsius Network include Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, XRP, ZCash, Bitcoin Cash and Dash.
The integration allows users to save 50% on applicable credit card transaction fees.
Says Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky,
The integration provides another onramp for crypto buyers. Celsius Network joins exchanges such as Binance that use Simplex to connect investors’ traditional credit cards to their Bitcoin and crypto portals.
Simplex, founded in 2014, has emerged as a key player in enabling crypto merchants to introduce credit card purchasing to mainstream users worldwide.
