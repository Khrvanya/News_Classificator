Litecoin trading is now live on P2P exchange LocalCryptos.
The exchange held a vote in February among its users to find out what coin they most wanted to trade.
Dash, EOS, and Litecoin were the options, with LTC coming out on top.
The Bitcoin and Ethereum peer-to-peer trading platform, LocalCryptos, today announced that Litecoin trading is now live on its exchange.
LocalCryptos was formerly known as LocalEthereum before it rebranded late last year and added support for Bitcoin. Now, it's expanding its offerings even more.
In mid-February, the exchange put its next move up for a community vote, allowing its users to determine which coin it would list next: Dash, EOS, or Litecoin—with LTC coming out on top.
Lucky for LocalCryptos, the similarities between Bitcoin and Litecoin make adding it to the platform an easy transition: “Because Bitcoin and Litecoin are so similar, we can port our non-custodial BTC escrow script to Litecoin without any major changes,” the firm explained in an email to users. “LTC escrows on LocalCryptos will be on-chain P2SH transactions.”
In other words, LTC users won’t have to worry about any pesky centralization. Their Litecoin wallets on LocalCryptos will be self-custodial and SegWit-enabled. "Your keys-your coins,” the exchange assured.
