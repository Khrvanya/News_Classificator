Litecoin price analysis shows that the bears have fully gained control of the market following a sharp decline near the $30 level. Will the bearish trend continue?
For the past 6 days, the price of Litecoin (LTC) was unable to break above the $60 resistance level. As a result, LTC price declined below the $50 and $40 support level.
Today, Litecoin price has dipped further since yesterday. At the time of writing this Litecoin price analysis, the coin has slumped to $34 level. It is noteworthy that the crypto market has collapsed with over $30 billion wiped out from the market in a matter of minutes. In the meantime, it is still unclear what might have caused the massive sell-off across the board.
On the downside, if support at $30 caves in, Litecoin price could drop further toward the next support level at $25 and $20 level. On the upside , if more buyers emerge, the price could recover towards the $40 and $50 resistance. The main resistance is now near the $55.
Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) line and the signal line are below the zero line which indicates a sell signal.
