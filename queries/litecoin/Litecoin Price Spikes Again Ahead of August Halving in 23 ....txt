Even a tweet of a Litecoin-hating influencer could not stop it from registering its most profitable day in three weeks.
The world’s fourth-largest largest cryptocurrency established an intraday top of $95 after ballooning by more than 23 percent in the previous 24 hours. The surge appeared after American football team Miami Dolphins made Litecoin (Ticker: LTC) its official cryptocurrency . The collaboration will allow fans to pay for the team’s 50/50 raffle via Litecoin, and as well via Bitcoin.

The announcement escalated Litecoin’s bullish bias as the cryptocurrency prepares to undergo a supply cut on August 6 this year. The so-called halvening event will reduce the blockchain reward on Litecoin blockchain by half – from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. That would prompt miners to add less LTC units to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The deflationary nature of the entire process makes Litecoin an ideal asset to hold.
Mati Greenspan of eToro discussed the impact of halvening events on cryptocurrencies in a Bloomberg interview . The senior financial analyst recalled the exponential upside actions in both the Bitcoin and Litecoin markets following their supply rate cuts.
“So, if that pattern continues, what we’ve seen so far is small potatoes in comparison,” he added. “This is quite normal for the crypto market.”
