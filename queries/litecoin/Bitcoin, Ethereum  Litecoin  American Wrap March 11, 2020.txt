A few financial commentators are shouting about the support zone in BTC/USD in the chart below marked by the black rectangle.

Now the market needs to see if the level is important enough to reject to the downside and the bulls may come in to push the price higher.
Ethereum (ETH) is changing hands at $197.70, down 1.4% since the beginning of the day and -2.65% on a day-to-day basis.

Litecoin Price Analysis: Where are the support levels? Maybe 46.00 will work
Litecoin is looking bearish again and the price is trading another 5% lower on Wednesday. This comes after a heavy fall over the weekend.
