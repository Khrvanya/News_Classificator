LitecoinÂ (LTC) is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies in existence and launched in October 2011 as a fork of Bitcoin. It shares many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin but strives to be lighter and faster and as a result, exhibits shorter block generation times of approximately 2.5 minutes. This allows for both faster transaction clearance and in turn, lower transaction fees than Bitcoin.
