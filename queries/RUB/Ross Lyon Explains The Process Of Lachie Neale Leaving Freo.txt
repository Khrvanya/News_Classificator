Ross Lyon gave some great insight into Lachie Neale's departure from Fremantle back in 2018.
Neale has since emerged into one of the premier on-ballers in the AFL and is the current Brownlow medal favourite.
Ross said he didn't want to let Neale go and revealed his biggest regret while coaching Neale.

He also explained some of the dealing with Lachie Weller leaving for Pick 2 to the Suns.
