A Leeds restaurant is offering the opportunity to dine with celebs when they reopen for business and the guestlist is pretty epic!
You could end up sitting with David Beckham, Julia Roberts, The Rock, Johnny Depp, Jennifer Lopez, Leonardo Dicaprio and Angelina Jolie...or at least cardboard cut-outs of them!
This is the bright idea from Indian restaurant Mumtaz, based at Leeds Dock, which is trying to make social distancing fun. Ahead of reopening on Saturday, July 4 the curry house has brought in a strict set of measures to help combat coronavirus .
As well as cleanliness and hygeine rules, the celebrity cut-outs are spaced out around the restaurant filling chairs that must not be sat in! This will ensure customers sit far enough apart.
Asad Arif, Mumtaz customer and business relations manager, said: “We’ve come up with a clever way to retain our title as ‘the selfie restaurant’ and maintain social distant seating without making our 300 seat capacity restaurant look half empty.
“We are hoping people will see the funny, but clever, side of it and take the opportunity to take loads of pictures and build happy memories.”

Ahead of reopening, Mumtaz will be handing out free meals for residents in LS1 and LS10 to come and collect.
Between 6pm and 9pm, on Friday, July 3 they will prepare 500 chicken biryanis and 500 vegetable biryanis. This is the second time the restaurant has given away free meals, with a previous giveaway being a smash hit - with 600 meals prepared, even though they only estimated 200 would take up the offer.
