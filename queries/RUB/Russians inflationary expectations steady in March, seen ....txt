Russians' inflationary expectations steady in March, seen rising in future - c.bank
MOSCOW, March 25 (Reuters) - Russian householdsâ€™ expectations for inflation in the year ahead stood at an average of 7.9% in March, the same level as in February, the central bank said on Wednesday based on a regular poll.
Inflationary expectations, which were hovering near their lowest levels ever recorded, were measured in early March before a rapid slump in the rouble that is now seen spurring consumer inflation in the next few months, the central bank said.
