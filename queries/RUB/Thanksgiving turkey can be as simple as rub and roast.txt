Position a rack in the lower third of the oven (remove the upper racks); preheat to 350 degrees. Place a flat rack inside a shallow roasting pan (with sides no higher than 2 or 3 inches).
Stir together the salt, thyme, sage, paprika, black pepper and mustard in a small bowl.
Pat the turkey dry, inside and out. Rub it with the oil, then coat it with the dried seasoning blend, making sure to scatter some in the cavity of the bird as well.
Place the turkey on the rack inside your shallow roasting pan, then pour in about 1 cup of water. Roast (lower rack) for 2 1/2 hours, turning the pan from front to back a few times to promote even browning. (If it begins to look too dark, you can partially cover the bird with aluminum foil.)
The turkey is done when the internal temperature of the breast meat registers 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, and the thigh meat registers 165 to 175 degrees (taken away from the bone).
Let rest for at least 30 minutes before serving; strain the pan juices for serving as is or for making gravy.
