CZ said at this event:
In about two weeks or so, we should have support for Russian rubles trading directly. So you can buy cryptocurrencies on Binance.com using rubles.
Just nine days later, Binance announced that it hadÂ enabled RUB deposits and withdrawals viaÂ Advanced Cash,Â a payment platform powered by Gibraltar-based ADV Project Ltd that claims to be "faster than conventional money transfers, cheaper than a regular bank account, and easier to use than other e-currency systems."
