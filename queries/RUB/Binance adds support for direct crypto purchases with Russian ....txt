Binance, the second-largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume, has enabled immediate purchases of four major digital currencies with the Russian ruble.
The development allows Binance users to link their Visa bank card and buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP with the ruble, according to a Feb. 5 announcement. The stock market claims that users can complete a purchase in less than a minute and do not have to make deposits prior to a purchase.
Binance plans to launch Mastercard support and other currencies in the near future.
Binance quietly launched the ruble trade at the end of October 2019, allowing users to deposit on the platform and withdraw into the national currency of Russia. At the time, Binanceâ€™s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, revealed that Russia was one of the top 10 markets on the stock market.
Indeed, a survey by Forklog of Russian-language crypto news outlets published last summer indicated that Binance was the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, with nearly 60% of respondents claiming they prefer Binance to others global crypto exchanges.
In December Binance further expanded the trading opportunities for the Turksh lira and added a new trading pair for the lira and the ruble. The community manager of Binance Turkey said that the stock market has added order book trade for all its Turkish lira trading pairs: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, Binance USD (BUSD) and Tether (USDT). Previously, these trading pairs were only available as buying or selling with one click directly to and from the stock exchange.
Binance recently launched peer-to-peer trading for the Vietnamese dong, allowing its users to buy and sell large cryptocurrencies using the latest versions of the Binance P2P mobile app on iOS and Android using dong.
