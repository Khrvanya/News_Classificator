England’s Eoin Morgan hailed the diversity of his World Cup-winning team after the hosts beat New Zealand in the final at Lord’s.
Morgan, who was born in Dublin and switched allegiance from Ireland to England a decade ago, was asked: “Do you think the luck of an Irishman got England over the line?”
His response has since gone viral on social media.
