Make the rub: In a large bowl, combine all rub ingredients and mix well.
Prepare the ribs: Rinse the pork ribs then pat dry and place on a medium sheet pan, fat side up. Coat the ribs all over with the dry rub. Place in the fridge uncovered for at least 7 hours or overnight.
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top. Transfer ribs to rack and cook, uncovered, 1 1/2 hours. Cover with foil and cook for an additional 1 hour. The ribs will be done when they have an internal temperature of 180 degrees and the meat pulls away from the bone.
Let rest for 30 minutes before slicing into individual ribs. Garnish with crushed peanuts, if desired.
