Dublin Gazette has teamed up with Dogs Trust to help find homes for lost and abandoned dogs.
This week’s dog of the week is Ivy, a sweet and affectionate five-year-old Husky cross girl who loves belly rubs from everyone she meets.
She can form strong attachments with people – so, ideally, she is looking for a home where there is someone always there to keep her company.
Ivy has a lovely, playful personality and had great fun with her toys.
She would benefit from positive reward-based training to help her behave calmly around other dogs, and also with handling by vets.
If you have room in your heart and home for Ivy, then please contact Dogs Trust on 01 879 1000. They are based in Finglas, just off exit 5 on the M50. Map and directions can be found on their website www.dogstrust.ie.
You can also find them on Facebook or Twitter @ DogsTrust_IE . Remember: Always have your dog on a lead when in public.
