2 pounds large clusters of black oyster mushrooms or lion’s mane, or portobello mushrooms
Make the rub: In a large bowl, combine all rub ingredients and mix well. Reserve 1/4 cup rub for the mushrooms and put the rest in an airtight container for another use, such as chicken, salmon or cauliflower.
Prepare the mushrooms: Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a slightly damp kitchen towel, wipe the mushrooms to remove any dirt. (Don’t rinse the mushrooms or submerge them in water.) Carefully cut or tear the mushrooms into 6 large pieces about the size of a hand.
Place the mushrooms on a large sheet pan and drizzle them with the oil and Worcestershire sauce. Gently massage the reserved 1/4 cup dry rub into the nooks and crannies of the mushrooms.
Roast the mushrooms on the top rack until deeply browned and crisp at the edges, about 40 minutes.
