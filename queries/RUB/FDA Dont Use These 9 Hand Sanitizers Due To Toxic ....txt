“CleanCare” and “NoGerm” may sound like great things to strive for as opposed to “MakeBlind” or “HandsStillDirty.” Nonetheless, FDA testing revealed, for example, that samples of the Lavar Gel product contained not one, not two but 81 percent methanol. How about the right type of alcohol, ethyl alcohol? Zero percent. Don’t give that product or any of these nine products a hand.
It’s been five days since the FDA contacted Eskbiochem with the recommendation that the company remove the nine products from the market. But lo and behold the products remain on the market. Getting a message from the FDA is not like getting a message from someone on Tinder. You shouldn’t ignore it.
So now the FDA is going public and telling people to not use these products and get rid of them. By the way, “get rid of” doesn’t mean put in in the trash so that junior can rub it on to his hands or tongue or put in down the drain or toilet so that lots of other people can enjoy this toxic substance. It means disposing of it safely. Besides being toxic, methanol is quite flammable as well. So don’t put it anywhere near flames such as your birthday cake.

Getting Covid-19 is not good but falling into a coma simply because you used the wrong hand sanitizer ain’t good either. Be careful when using hand sanitizer. In the words of Britney Spears, it’s not that innocent. There are bogus or even dangerous products out there. Washing your hands with soap and water is typically better and more effective at cleaning your hands. But if you can’t access soap and water, make sure that the hand sanitizer that you are using is legit and has at least 60 percent ethanol. After all, you do want hand sanitizer to actually do something like sanitize your hands.
