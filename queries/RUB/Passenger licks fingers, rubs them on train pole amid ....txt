A drunken straphanger went off the rails on a Belgian subway train amid the coronavirus crisis — licking his fingers and wiping them on a pole, according to a report.
The passenger was captured on video lowering his face mask and sticking two fingers in his mouth before rubbing his hand up and down the pole, according to the UK’s Metro .
Twitter user @SoufOff posted the footage Monday, writing in French: “Stop touching the bars.”
The sicko “was arrested by the police and our security service. The subway train has been removed from service for cleaning,” the Brussels Intercommunal Transport Co. said in a statement.
There have been 314 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death in Belgium, the news site reported.
More than 115,000 have been infected by the bug globally and about 4,300 have died.
