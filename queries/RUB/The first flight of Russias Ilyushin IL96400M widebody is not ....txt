The base IL-96-300 made its maiden flight in 1988, with Russian flag carrier Aeroflot becoming the first airline to operate the type in 1993. The first IL-96-400T freighter was delivered in 2009 to Polyot Airlines, the now non-existent subsidiary of VASO. Up to now, VASO has built four of the four-engine freighters, with two (RA-96101 and RA-96103) stored at VASO, and the other two (RA-96102 and RA-96104) utilised by state customers in refurbished passenger versions.

The project’s main disappointment is the absence of any firm orders, with no sign of real – not declarative, politically motivated – interest from commercial airlines. In 2017, Ilyushin announced that the upgrade would require a financial injection of more than 53 billion roubles (US$0.85 billion), including 10 billion roubles for research and development, 1.5 billion roubles for upgrading VASO’s manufacturing facilities and 42 billion roubles for topping up the capital of the state-owned leasing company, which would act as the aircraft’s customer. In 2018 the Russian government allocated 1.32 billion roubles to UAC for the programme.
UAC previously confirmed plans to build six serial aircraft before 2025 at the rate of two or 2.5 units per year.
