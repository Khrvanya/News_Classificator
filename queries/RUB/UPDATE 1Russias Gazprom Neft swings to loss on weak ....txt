MOSCOW, May 28 (Reuters) - Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom, swung to a first-quarter loss of 13.8 billion roubles ($194 million) because of weakness in the rouble and oil prices, the company said on Thursday.
The loss compared with a profit of 107.9 billion roubles in the same period last year.
Global oil producers have had to contend with overproduction, weak demand and low oil prices amid the economic fallout from coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Gazprom Neft, based in St Petersburg, said the current market environment does not affect long-term objectives outlined in the company’s strategy to 2030.
The company also said its revenue in in the first quarter declined 12% year on year to 515 billion roubles.
Its first-quarter hydrocarbon production, including Gazprom Neft’s share in joint ventures, rose to 184.13 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7.3% year on year.
