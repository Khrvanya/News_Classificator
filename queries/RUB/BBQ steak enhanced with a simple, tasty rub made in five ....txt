1. Crush all your spices roughly using a pestle and mortar; rub the mixture gently into the meat; avoiding rubbing too hard.
2. Wrap your joint in clingfilm and chill overnight. If you don't have time to leave your rub overnight, just prepare as far in advance as possible.
3. When it comes to grilling, remember that beef does not need to be cooked all the way through if you like it rare; we recommend the tactile test to see if your meat is done to your liking.
4. Once the meat is brown on the outside, take it off your grill and rest. Then, simply prod the meat with your index finger: if it feels like your cheek, it's rare; if it feels like your chin, it's medium done; your forehead – your meat is well done.
This makes enough for three to four people.
