After his third back surgery, Harvey Dicks of Eagan noticed tension in his back that wasn't going away. Rather than seeking physical therapy, Dicks heard about a Rasmussen College massage clinic that charges $20 an hour, half the price of his co-pay for a session with a physical therapist. "I've gotten major relief," he said. "It's so relaxing I fall asleep most of the time."
With plenty of accredited massage schools throughout the Twin Cities, relief isn't far away. Two clinics even offer free services. You'll wait the longest to nab those appointments, but even the most expensive student massages top out at $45 an hour, a $20 to $50 savings over most massages.
If you feel a bit vulnerable about being nearly naked in the hands of a student, the newbie generally has nine to 18 months of instruction before working on paying clients. School clinics offer a wide range of massages from Swedish to reflexology, said Terry Clements, program coordinator and instructor at Rasmussen College in Eden Prairie.
The ease of getting an appointment depends on the school's calendar and the number of students near graduation. Clients are asked to fill out a health questionnaire before the first massage. If you're fantasizing about unlimited free massages, dream on. Schools that don't charge a fee limit the number of visits per quarter. When making an appointment, specify a student massage to get the discounted rate.
