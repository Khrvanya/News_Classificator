In a medium-sized pot, add chicken breast and thighs and cover with 2 quarts of water. Bring water to a boil, then simmer until fully cooked about 20 to 25 minutes.
Remove cooked chicken from pot, allow to cool, then shred into small pieces. Cover and set aside.
In a large pot, combine ½ cup unsalted butter and ½ cup flour. Cook over medium heat, frequently stirring with a whisk to make a dark brown roux, about 15 minutes. In the last 5 minutes make sure to continuously stir so the roux does not burn.
Add onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic. Sauté until vegetables are tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.
You may add more water depending on how thick you want the gumbo.
Simmer over medium-low heat, for approximately 30 minutes with pot loosely covered, stirring occasionally.
Add cooked shredded chicken and simmer an additional 15 minutes.
Turn off heat, and slowly stir in the gumbo file. Do not re-boil after adding as this tends to make the gumbo stringy. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired.
