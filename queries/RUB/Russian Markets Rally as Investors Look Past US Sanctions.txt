Russian Markets Rally as Investors Look Past U.S. Sanctions
Russian markets have soared this year as the threat of U.S. sanctions has waned and investors have turned their attention to signs of an improving economy.
Equities in Moscow are poised for their best annual performance in three years: The MOEX Russia Index, the main ruble-denominated stocks benchmark, has rallied over 27% so far, while the dollar-denominated RTS Index is up over 40%. The benchmarks have outstripped most other emerging markets and kept pace with the S&P 500.
