One of the south side’s best smoked meat spots is no more.
Popular Coorparoo barbeque spot Special Rub has closed. The restaurant announced the news via a Facebook post on Monday.
At the time of writing there are more than 330 comments on the Facebook post expressing disappointment at the restaurant's sudden closure.
Special Rub opened in April last year and immediately turned heads with its ironbark-smoked barbeque, burgers and southern fried chicken. Opened by Popmega (Remy’s, Hai Hai, King Tea, Superfly Funk Eye), it was a departure from the Asian-style menus the restaurant group is perhaps better known for.
Broadsheet reached out to Popmega co-owner Dane Huitfeldt for comment for this story. We were yet to hear back at the time of publication.
