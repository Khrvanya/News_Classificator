A group of DIY mums have revealed how to banish the stubborn black stains from the back of an iron by using Panadol tablets.
Members from the popular Australian Facebook page, Mums Who Cook, Clean and Organise, shared the tip after a woman wrote a post seeking advice for removing the stains.
'Remind me how to clean this [stain] off, do you just wipe it with vinegar while it's still warm?' the mum wrote alongside the photo of her stained iron.
Hundreds of mums replied, advising her to use tweezers and rub Panadol tablets onto the stain while the iron is still hot.
After trying the simple trick on the iron once it heated up, the woman said the hack worked amazingly well and removed the stain completely.
'It worked, amazing! How does someone come up with this?,' she said.
'I used two Panamax [tablets], wiped it off with a damp cloth, then did a final wipe with vinegar and a scrubbing brush to get into the holes.'
The woman said her husband will be impressed too, as he irons his own shirts every morning before going to work.
A chemical reaction is said to take place when the Panadol tablet is applied to the hot iron.
