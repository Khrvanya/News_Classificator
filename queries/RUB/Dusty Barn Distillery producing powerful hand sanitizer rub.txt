Several organizations took Matt up on the offer, so he was just sealing the heads in water jugs or cleaned beer or wine bottles to donate.
Then, the Tobacco Trade Bureau (formerly the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) loosened regulations so that distillers could begin producing hand sanitizer to sell. The World Health Organization published a recipe on how to use denatured spirits — that is, a high-alcohol mixture not made for drinking — for hand sanitizer by adding glycerin and hydrogen peroxide.
Matt and Dusty Barn social media manager Laura Sills based their own recipe on this one.
Most purchased hand sanitizers have about 60% alcohol. The higher the alcohol content, the better the disinfection action, but ingredients added to give the gel-like texture dilute the alcohol.
As whiskey heads usually distill at over 80% alcohol, the finished product, even after adding other ingredients, winds up being 80% or close to it. And it’s not thick.
“We recommend using it in a spray bottle,” said Sills. “You can dip a finger into it or just pour some in your hand, but it’s easier to control in a spray bottle.”
At home, you can even add a drop or two of fragrance extract.
The hand rub is available in half-pint ($5), pint ($6) and quart ($11) sizes. If you bring back a Dusty Barn pint or quart jar for refill, you’ll save a dollar.
Best of all, a half-pint will be given free with any purchase of $50 worth of Dusty Barn’s spirits, including Hoosier Moon unaged corn whiskey, Casked Corn aged corn whiskey, Rye, Bourbon, Nocino made with walnuts from the farm, and others.
At this time, quantities are limited to two jars of any size per customer, as Dusty Barn only produces about 10 gallons of heads a week.
Note, methanol is not meant to be consumed and can cause blindness, so don’t drink this hand sanitizer. Also, do not use it near an open flame as it is flammable.
Dusty Barn will continue to produce the product as long as there is a need for it.
