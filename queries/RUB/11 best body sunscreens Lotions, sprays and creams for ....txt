If your sunscreen has the letters UVA in a circle, the British Association of Dermatologists states that this shows the level of UVA protection in the product meets EU recommendations.
When it comes to applying sunscreen, Lisa advises doing it “ideally 20-30 minutes before going outside, then reapply at least every two hours. Reapply again after swimming, sweating or towel drying. If your sunscreen says: ‘once a day’ better to reapply every two hours just to be on the safe side as sporting activity, swimming or sweating can all cause it to wash or wipe away.”
Before you reach for that sunscreen at the back of the bathroom cabinet, “bear in mind that if your sunscreen is out of date it will no longer be effective”.
Always remember that “sunscreens should be used in conjunction with other sun safety measures such as seeking shade between 11am-3pm when the UV index is highest, protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses”.

Ultrasun offers full solar spectrum protection from UVA, UVB, blue light and infrared rays. It also protects against heat rash and prickly heat. Family-friendly, we loved this for its perfect gel texture (neither too sloppy nor too thick) and ease of application: even wriggly children didn’t mind putting it on. We liked the environmentally-friendly way the instructions are printed on the inside of the box and loved the diagram showing how many fingers of sunscreen for each body part – so simple and easy to remember. Although we are a little sceptical about “once a day”, this would be a great option for applying to children before the start of the school day or on school trips.
