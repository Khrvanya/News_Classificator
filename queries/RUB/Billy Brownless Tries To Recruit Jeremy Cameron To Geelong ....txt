GWS star forward Jeremy Cameron joined the Saturday Rub this afternoon after the Giants knocked off Collingwood in a thriller last night.
Billy Brownless couldn't help himself and asked ifÂ Cameron had signed a new contract yet. After he revealed that he hadn't recommitted to the Giants, Bill tried to lure him to the Cats!
This ended up being a pile on from the team about how ordinary the town of Geelong is!
The Coleman medalist also spoke about last night's win, the breakout game of 'The Tractor' Tom Green & fishing during isolation!
