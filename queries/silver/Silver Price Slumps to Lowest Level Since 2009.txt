The white metal has not been below US$13 since mid-2009; for context, its highest price ever was in the 1970s at nearly US$50.
Precious metals like silver are seen as safe havens, and generally become more appealing when interest rates fall. That’s because lower rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding metal.
The abnormal response recently, which extends to gold, has been blamed on investors hunting for liquidity in the form of cash.
“Everything is being sold, market participants are throwing in the towel just leaving the exits,” Commerzbank (OTC Pink: CRZBF ,ETR:CBK) analyst Carsten Fritsch told Reuters . Silver is also suffering from lower industrial demand.
Interestingly, some have pointed out that while the spot price of silver is low, demand for physical silver is so high that dealers are having trouble meeting it.
Bought gold and silver. Not because of price but because dealers cannot get supply. Prices dropping but nothing available to buy. Gold and silver being hoarded. Floating supply disappearing. Good news or bad news?
The spot silver price refers to the amount that the white metal could theoretically be sold for at a given time and is determined using a formula based on futures contracts. The price of physical silver is generally higher due to premiums put in place by sellers; these can rise during times of high demand .
It’s also worth noting that some silver stocks fared better than the metal itself on Monday.
While pure-play silver companies are few and far between, major names include First Majestic Silver (TSX: FR ,NYSE:AG), which was up 10.81 percent on the TSX at close of day Monday, and Pan American Silver (TSX: PAAS ,NASDAQ:PAAS), which finished the day up 5.58 percent on the exchange.
