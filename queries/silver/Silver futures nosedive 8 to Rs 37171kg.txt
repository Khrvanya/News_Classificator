Commenting on the March 16 fall, Navneet Damani, Vice President, Motilal Oswal, said ‘there is no specific reason why silver price have fallen’.
The gold/silver ratio currently stands at 108.19 to 1, which indicates the amount of silver required to buy one ounce of gold. The ratio has jumped from 99 to 116 in the last five trading session.
Speaking on the road ahead for the precious metal, Motilal Oswal said it may further test its lower support zone of Rs 37,500/kg. "MCX Silver traded on a negative note last week and closed lower by around 13.80 percent. It has broken its important support level of Rs 43,400 and has given a weekly close below the same, which indicates that the bearish momentum in the commodity is likely to continue."
The brokerage advises traders to sell on every rise. On the technical charts, Rs 43,700 remains critical resistance, while intermediate resistance is placed at Rs 42,500 levels.
On the London Metal Exchange, spot silver has strong short-term support at $13.50, whereas resistance is seen at $15.90 levels. At 10:05 (GMT), the precious metal fell 8.7 percent to $13.23 an ounce in London trading.
Damani sees prices falling further to $12.5 per ounce, where it could find some stability.
