New Delhi, Mar 3 (PTI) Silver prices declined by Rs 157 to Rs 42,025 per kg in futures trade today as speculators reduced their exposure, tracking a weak trend overseas.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, silver prices for delivery in March contracts traded lower by Rs 157 or 0.37 per cent, to Rs 42,025 per kg in business turnover of 90 lots.
Similarly, the white metal prices for delivery in far-month May contracts slumped Rs 123, or 0.29 per cent, to Rs 42,520 per kg in business volume of 4,725 lots.
In the international market, silver fell by 0.11 per cent to USD 17.70 an ounce in London.
Analysts attributed the fall in silver prices in futures trade to a weak trend in global markets on strengthening dollar amid concern that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates this month, reducing demand for precious metals.
