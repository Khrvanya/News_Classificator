Silver prices edged higher by 0.43 per cent to Rs 45,320 per kg in futures trade today after speculators enlarged positions on a firming trend overseas.
At the Multi Commodity Exchange, silver for delivery in September was up Rs 194, or 0.43 per cent, to Rs 45,320 per kg in a business turnover of 133 lots.
July silver added Rs 164, or 0.37 per cent, to trade at Rs 44,800 per kg in 133 lots.
Analysts attributed the rise in silver prices at futures trade to a firming trend in the precious metals overseas as investors assessed the outlook for US borrowing costs.
Meanwhile, silver traded 0.40 per cent higher at $21.18 an ounce in Singapore, the highest since March 18.
