Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - June 30, 2020) - Silver One Resources Inc. (TSXV: SVE) (OTCQX: SLVRF) (FSE: BRK1) ("Silver One" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the initiation of trading on the OTCQX. The OTCQX Best Market provides value and convenience to U.S. investors, brokers and institutions seeking to trade Silver One shares under the ticker symbol SLVRF. The OTCQX Best Market is OTC Markets Group's premier market for established, investor-focused U.S. and international companies. To be eligible, companies must meet high financial standards, follow best practice corporate governance, demonstrate compliance with U.S. securities laws, be current in their disclosure, and have a professional third-party sponsor introduction.
"We are pleased to reach the milestone of advancing from trading on the OTCQB to the OTCQX. This will make it easier for our U.S. investors to participate in Silver One, by reducing the requirement of having a Canadian trading account," said Greg Crowe, the CEO of Silver One. "With three highly prospective silver properties in the safe mining jurisdictions of Nevada and Arizona, Silver One is well positioned as a potential silver investment. This is becoming increasingly important for those who are concerned with operators in less secure areas of the world. Silver One has attracted a significant number of investors in the U.S. since it began trading on the OTCQB in May 2019 and the advancement to the OTCQX will only make investing easier for many of our current and future Silver One shareholders.
Silver One is focused on the exploration and development of quality silver projects.
The Company holds an option to acquire a 100%-interest in its flagship project, the past-producing Candelaria Silver Mine, Nevada. Potential reprocessing of silver from the historic leach pads at Candelaria is being investigated. Additional opportunities lie in previously identified high-grade silver intercepts down-dip and the possibility of increasing the substantive silver mineralization along-strike from the two past-producing open pits.
The Company has staked 636 lode claims and entered into a Lease/Purchase Agreement to acquire five patented claims on its Cherokee project located in Lincoln County, Nevada, host to multiple silver-copper-gold vein systems traced to date for over 12 km along-strike. The property also has potential for limestone related polymetallic plus silver and gold and/or other intrusive related systems at depth.
Silver One holds an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Silver Phoenix Project. The Silver Phoenix Project is a very high-grade native silver prospect that lies within the "Arizona Silver Belt", immediately adjacent to the prolific copper producing area of Globe, Arizona.
In addition, the Company also holds a 100% interest in three significant silver assets located in Mexico - Pe√±asco Quemado, Sonora; La Frazada, Nayarit; and Pluton, Durango, acquired from First Mining Gold, one of the Company's largest shareholders.
