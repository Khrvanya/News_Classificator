SILVER BAY, MN-- The Minnesota Veterans Home in Silver Bay hasn't seen the impact other assisted living homes throughout the country have from Coronavirus.
In fact they're not even close.
"We have not had any staff or any residents with COVID in our building, and we think it's because of our pretty strong protocol," said Joyce Scott, the home's Public Relations Manager.
Those protocols include health screenings where staff get their temperature taken before they can start their shift. Meanwhile, Scott said, "Then of course we have our garb, we have the infamous infection control we wear. We have to wear surgical masks and everybody all day on their shift has to wear a face shield."
Staff purchased iPads for residents when visiting was put on hold.
It's helped Veteran Mike Doden him keep in touch with loved ones.
"I've got a few friends from Sioux Falls, South Dakota and some friends in LaVerne," he said.
Visitors were recently allowed to come back, but there are requirements.
Visitors have to stand on the outside of the patio where a piece of plexi-glass separates guests from residents.
While the precuations are all for good measure, it did mean cancelling the 28th annual fishing trip with the American Legion Post 109.
Jim Latvala, a Legion member said, "Safety first. You know you can't have the residents on a boat, on a charter boat. There's no social distancing whatsoever, so it's sad."
While it may be disappointing, keeping our country's heroes safe is the first priority.
