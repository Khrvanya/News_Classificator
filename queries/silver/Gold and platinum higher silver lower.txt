On Thursday, gold was on its way to breaking out and bringing $1,800 into play but a  late-day sell-off kept it in a trading range and still in danger of failing.  Thursdayâ€™s inside day was disappointing, although it appears gold may make  another attempt to run today. There are still concerns with gold; $1,725 in the  August futures is a key level to hold and over $1,775 would be considered a  breakout.
Silver is  either consolidating on the lower end of support or getting ready to reverse to  the short side. The $17.75 level in the September futures is a major level that  must hold or there could be a reversal to the short side. A breakout above  $18.50 should lead to new highs. At this point, we are long and will assume  higher but are extremely cautious.
Platinum reversed to short the other day and was lower Thursday with a minor rally  today. Our next target to the downside is $800 in the October futures.  Resistance is $875 in the October futures. We are looking to sell rallies in  platinum.
The picture  in metals is murky; silver and gold are bullish but at key levels. We remain  long both but need to see more buying to convince us they are going much  higher. Platinum is clearly lower and we are short.
