SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 14, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Monetary Metals® announced today the first tranche of its program to offer an instant yield to clients who have coins and small bars. The market currently offers a historically high premium on these products. But until now, retail investors have not had a way to capture the gain without also selling their gold and silver. Monetary Metals offers them a way to earn this premium in the form of more metal while keeping their investment in metal.
"Monetary Metals' promise is 'A Yield on Gold, Paid in Gold®,' and we are pleased to offer a new way to pay a yield," said Keith Weiner, CEO of Monetary Metals.
An investor with 100 ounces in gold Eagles got 104 ounces of bulk gold bullion. An investor with 100 ounces in silver Eagles ended up with 121 ounces of bulk silver. This gain comes even before they put their metal to work and start earning interest.
Due to the government's policy response to the virus, people are turning to gold and silver. This has led to tight market conditions for retail products such as gold and silver coins and small bars. The premium on these products is high and Monetary Metals is uniquely positioned to offer investors the best way to have their cake, and eat it, too—i.e. profit from the high premiums and still keep their precious metal.
The opportunity is still open for new and existing clients.
