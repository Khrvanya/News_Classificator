This morning  at about 5 a.m. EDT, gold , silver and platinum and copper spiked. Then 10 minutes  later, they collapsed. August gold rallied to $1,750, September silver $18.07  and October platinum $840, and now are all near the lows of the day. Silver is  still higher while gold and platinum have turned negative on the day.
Not much has  changed in gold, which reached resistance this morning at $1,750 and is now  failing. The key levels remain $1,725 support and $1,750 resistance. The  pattern is still ugly. Although we are still long, this morningâ€™s spike was  more bearish than bullish. Obviously, we would love to see a breakout higher.  There is a big move coming and the odds favor lower; however, we will stay long  until our signal changes.
Silver is in  a similar pattern and must hold $17.75 in the September futures. We are long in  silver as well but have the same concerns. The pattern is weak, and the next  move has a higher probability of being down. We are short October platinum, and  the pattern suggest the next support is $800 in the October futures.
