The gold related markets were outstanding in 2019. Gold shares were especially strong, leading the way for the entire sector, observe resource sector specialists Mary Anne and Pamela Aden, editors of The Aden Forecast.
The XAU gold share index, for example, surged nearly 50%. It more than doubled the gains in gold and the Dow Jones Industrials. It also outperformed Nasdaq and, overall, it was the top performer.
There’s no question that gold and gold shares are in major bull markets. The same is true of silver. Most interesting, these major bull markets are still in their early stages.
That is, they have a lot further to go on the upside. They’ll likely outperform stocks and bonds and they’re set to be top performers as 2020 unfolds.
The gold related markets have many factors in their favor, like low or zero interest rates and a U.S. dollar that’s beginning to weaken. Global uncertainty, central bank buying, and a mature stock market are also very positive. Plus, investor sentiment is now shifting toward gold.
As these markets head higher, gold shares will probably continue to outperform gold, which is usually the case during bull markets, but we recommend buying both.
An easy way to invest in these markets is by buying the SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ). For gold shares we like the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ( GDX ). And for silver, which is also poised to outperform, we like the iShares Silver Trust ( SLV ).
