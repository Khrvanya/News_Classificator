Now that the reality of last night’s bizarre events have well and truly sunk in, we turn can turn our attention to whom the Ottawa Senators might select with the 3rd overall pick. It seems a foregone conclusion that Alexis Lafreniere will go 1st overall to the Unknown Team , but after that there are some questions about who the Los Angeles Kings might take with the second choice. Most rankings have Quinton Byfield second, but recently Bob McKenzie had Tim Stutzle in the second slot on his big board. Byfield fell to third. McKenzie himself is not a minor hockey aficionado, but instead builds his rankings based on discussions with scouts and other NHL executives. Historically he’s been one of the most accurate prognosticators when it comes to the draft order; no one is as plugged in as McKenzie.
All of this to say that there appears to be real horse race for the second and third spots. Lafreniere will go first, but after that things might get complicated. From a Sens perspective, there’s reason to be excited about both Stutzle and Byfield though they are contrasts in style. Byfield is a huge centre with a big loping stride, soft hands and careful consideration. Stutzle, on the other hand is an absolute buzzsaw, using his speed to get defenders on their back foot before attacking one-one-one or unleashing his lethal shot. Since both play a position where the Sens are lacking, there will be no question of drafting for positional need. Whoever is left after the Kings pick will be a lot more than just a consolation prize.
So, this week’s question then: who do you want the team to end up with their 3rd overall choice? Are all in on the promise of the hulking centre in Byfield? Or would you rather see the roadrunner go to work in Stutzle? Or do you have someone else in mind altogether?
