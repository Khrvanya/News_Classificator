It's quite simple, really, and it requires no scrubbing or hard labour and all you need is aluminium foil,  bi-carb soda and some hot water - and you probably already have these at home.
Tik Tok user Jo, known as Lifestyle of Jo on the video platform, demonstrated the hack in a few short minutes and it really is a game changer.
She started by lining a kitchen bowl (of any size) with aluminium foil and placed the discoloured jewellery in the centre.
Her jewellery was dark in colour and had lost all its shine and glory.

She then poured boiling water to fill the bowl, making sure the jewellery is completely submerged.
Whipping out the bi-carb soda, she proceeded to pour a generous amount into the water until it starts to bubble.
Then wait it out for five minutes and watch as the magic unfolds.
In the clip, the water appeared to be murky and greyish in colour - a clean sign it's working hard to remove any discolouration from the jewellery caused by exposure to air over time.

After a few short minutes, it's time  to remove the jewellery items from the bowl, but the content creator advises against using anything metal and opted for plastic tweezers instead.
She then laid the pieces out flat on kitchen towel to soak up any residue, and after a deep clean, the jewellery appeared shiny and new again.
To finish off, gently polish the silver with a jewellery cloth, or any microfiber cloth, to reveal the newly transformed silver.
For heavily tarnished items, you might need to soak it a couple of times before getting the jewellery clean, but that's ok, because a hack this easy is well worth the result in the end.
