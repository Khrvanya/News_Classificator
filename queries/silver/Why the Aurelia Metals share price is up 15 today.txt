The Aurelia Metals Ltd (ASX: AMI) share price has surged 14.95% higher today on the back of its Q4 FY20 update.
The group is an Australian gold and base metals mining exploration company. Aurelia has a landholding in New South Wales’s polymetallic Cobar Basin and operates the Peak and Hera Mine projects.
The company has reported preliminary production increases in gold, copper, lead and zinc. However, the standout performer was in its gold production figures with gold increasing from 14.3 thousand ounces (koz) in Q3 FY20 to 32.8 koz in Q4 FY20. For FY20, preliminary gold production totalled 91.7 koz.
In addition, Aurelia’s cash balance at 30 June 2020 is $78.6 million which is an increase from $51.4 million at 31 March 2020. The group had no debt other than usual creditors.
On 9 June, Aurelia Metals released a Maiden Resource Estimate (MRE). The Federation deposit contains 197,000 tonnes of lead, 348,000 tonnes of zinc, 67,000 ounces of gold and 755,000 ounces of silver.
Drilling is ongoing to test the prospects of the mine with mineralisation ranges from 80–550 metres in depth and remains open in multiple directions.
A scoping study has commenced to evaluate project development options and the company is anticipating processing at the existing Hera Mine plant.
As stated in the introduction, the group operates the Hera Mine and Peak Mine.
Aurelia purchased Hera Mine as an undeveloped gold, lead, zinc and silver deposit in September 2009. The NSW government approved the development in July 2012 after extensive exploration and a feasibility study in September 2011.

After Aurelia Metals share price gain today, the company’s market capitalisation is worth $515 million.
