The NBA is scheduled to end its coronavirus -induced hiatus near the end of July. The site for the league’s return, Florida, is in the midst of spike in coronavirus cases. Regardless of that increase, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver delivered a measured response to the NBA’s decision to press ahead with an Orlando-based return.
In a report from ESPN , it was revealed that Silver acknowledged Florida’s spike in cases and the NBA’s plan to push ahead in a recent call with league executives.
In at least one recent call with high-level team executives, NBA commissioner Adam Silver has acknowledged the spiking numbers in Florida. Team sources described the general tone of that call, including the questions asked of Silver on it, as tense. Another called Silver’s tone “resolute but somber.” He expressed a resolve to go on — a confidence in the NBA’s bubble concept — while recognizing the seriousness of the coronavirus spike, sources said.
Silver’s bubble plan does not fully account for the non-NBA support staff employed on the Disney properties. NBPA executive director Michele Roberts explained to ESPN that enhancing the restrictions on third-party employees is an item on the union’s radar.
Of the rising figures, NBPA executive director Michele Roberts told ESPN: “Can’t say I am surprised, given the state’s approach to reopening. We are obviously clearly monitoring the situation. While we take some solace in knowing our players will not travel commercially to get to Orlando, that access to the campus is severely limited and, of course, all of the other health and safety protocols in place, the numbers will keep our attention. If necessary to add further restrictions respecting those third parties having access to the campus, we will seek to implement them.”
