The silver contract for September delivery plunged 11 percent suddenly overnight.
The futures quickly made back most of that decline.
The drop in silver is the latest in a series of flash crashes in the last 12 months.
Silver futures suddenly dropped before quickly bouncing back in another "flash crash" that renewed fears that computer-driven trading has gone too far.
Around 7:05 p.m. ET Thursday, the contract for September delivery plunged 11 percent from $16.14 per troy ounce to $14.34, according to FactSet. Silver traded near $15.87 per troy ounce Friday morning.
Traders could not name a fundamental reason for the drop, but considered it another case of computer-driven trading that disrupted markets during a period when few were actively trading. Like most other recent flash crashes, the drop in silver occurred outside of New York business hours and in the early hours of Asian market operations.
Silver futures are traded on the Nymex exchange, run by CME Group. In an emailed statement Friday, CME's senior director of corporate communications Chris Grams said that "last night just after 18:06 CST [7:06 p.m. ET], CME Group's front month Silver futures contract experienced increased volatility."
Grams added that, "Our markets worked as designed, with velocity logic pausing the market for 10 seconds at 18:06, allowing liquidity to come back into the market. Per our rulebook, prices were adjusted in the September and December Silver futures contracts and several mini futures contracts."
