In our humble opinion we are now entering a bullish phase for the precious metals sector. The scene is set for this sector to outperform the others. The stock markets in general are undergoing a major correction and currencies are being devalued as interest rates move to zero or negative.
The precious metals sector has been battered and has spent 6 years in a bear phase which has forced the producers to adapt and cut costs across the board. The result is that there are now a number of companies that are leaner and slimmer than ever before, and they are generating profits.
As gold prices head towards forming new record highs some of these producers will be revalued at much higher price levels than they are today. The top-quality stocks will outperform this sector significantly so do the due diligence before putting your hard-earned cash at risk.
