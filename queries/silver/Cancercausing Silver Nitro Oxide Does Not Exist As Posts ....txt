The claims about a new type of cancer are false; experts told AFP Fact Check that "silver nitro oxide" does not exist.
"There is no such chemical called, 'silver nitro oxide'," a spokesperson for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told AFP Fact Check in an email on June 13, 2020.
AFP Fact Check ran a search of the database of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an intergovernmental agency run by the World Health Organization (WHO) that coordinates research into the causes of cancer.
Dr William G. Cance, the chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, also told AFP Fact Check that "there is no valid evidence that 'silver nitro oxide' is carcinogenic based on searches of the IARC and EPA databases".
The claims about risky radiation are equally false; the peak radiation power for mobile phones is only about 2 watts -- which does no harm to the body.
According to the WHO, mobile phones are "low-powered radiofrequency transmitters, operating at frequencies between 450 and 2700 MHz with peak powers in the range of 0.1 to 2 watts".
"A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use".
It is true that PPA, which stands for phenylpropanolamine -- not "Phenyl Propanol-Amide" as the post claims -- has been linked to haemorrhagic stroke among young women. The US Food and Drug Administration said in a 2015 bulletin that "the risk of hemorrhagic stroke is very low, even with phenylpropanolamine use".
Claim Review : Scratch cards contain silver nitro oxide which causes cancer.
