He was responding to a call about an incident on the Main Street in Castlerea, Co Roscommon.
The 49-year-old had only recently been stationed in the town and transferred to the detective unit.
Before the move, he had been based at the garda station in Ballaghaderreen.
Earlier today the town stood in silent tribute as his remains were brought through the town on route to Charlestown.
The cortege, flanked by a number of Gardai on motorcycles, stopped for a couple of moments outside the garda station before moving through the town.
The streets were lined with people who clapped as the hearse made its way to the Charlestown road.
The Mayo man will be buried on Sunday in his native Charlestown after a State funeral in the town at 11.30am.
