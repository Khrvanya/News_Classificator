After auctioning off a signed unreleased pair of Off-White™ x Air Jordan 4 “Sail” sneakers for the Black Lives Matter movement, Virgil Abloh ’s titular streetwear-meets-luxury fashion label is continuing to bolster its SS20 catalog with a new Silver-tone Key Chain Necklace.
The new brass-constructed accessory features a polished texture, a key and keyring pendant, and an intricate chain. The piece keeps branding to a minimum, with Off-White™’s signature logo emblazoned on the key.
Take a detailed look at Off-White™’s Silver-Tone Key Chain Necklace above. They are currently available via The Webster’s webstore and Trading Post for $615 USD.
