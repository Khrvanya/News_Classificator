ECHO PARK-SILVER LAKE, CA — Independence Day events across the country, particularly in Los Angeles County, will not look the same this year, thanks to the coronavirus.
Due to regional health orders and an L.A. County ban on organized fireworks, cities and organizations canceled their traditional Fourth of July extravaganzas, including near Echo Park and Silver Lake.
But the patriotic spirit persists, nonetheless, throughout the area and Greater L.A., as several communities are hosting live aerial flyovers, virtual fireworks and parades, decorating contests and fun, Independence Day activities to do from home.
And if you're up for a drive, there are a smattering of fireworks shows set to go off in Riverside , Orange and San Diego counties and in Rancho Cucamonga — although most come with viewing restrictions.
Peruse the list to see what's on tap and what's canceled for 2020. Stay safe, and have a Happy Fourth of July, from Patch!
