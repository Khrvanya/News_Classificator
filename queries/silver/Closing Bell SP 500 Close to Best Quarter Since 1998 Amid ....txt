According to Marijuana Business Daily , those sales could be as high as $37 billion by 2023 as spending on adult-use cannabis in markets not driven by tourism has increased.
Medical marijuana sales are booming in Florida, Maryland, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, which is offsetting sales in markets like Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan, where recreational cannabis is legal.
