OCEANA COUNTY, MI â€“ The annual July Fourth fireworks display at Silver Lake have been canceled this year.
Because the Silver Lake State Park day use areas will close at 10 p.m. Saturday, July 4, there will be no safe place to discharge fireworks, nor for visitors to safely view them, according to a statement releaed by Scott Beal, executive director of the Silver Lake Sand Dunes-Hart Visitors Bureau, that was sent on Wednesday, July 1.
The visitors bureau had announced on Facebook earlier this week that it was trying to find an alternate location to shoot off the fireworks.
Restrictions on large gatherings due to the coronavirus impacted the decision to cancel the annual display, according to Beal.
Many community fireworks displays typically held on Independence Day have been canceled due to COVID-19.
In addition to washing hands regularly and not touching your face , officials recommend practicing social distancing, assuming anyone may be carrying the virus.
Health officials say you should be staying at least 6 feet away from others and working from home, if possible.
Use disinfecting wipes or disinfecting spray cleaners on frequently-touched surfaces in your home (door handles, faucets, countertops) and carry hand sanitizer with you when you go into places like stores.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has also issued an executive order requiring people to wear face coverings over their mouth and nose while inside enclosed, public spaces.
