The Company has carried out extensive exploration and resource definition drill programs on its Silver Sand Project since acquisition in 2017.  In total the Company has completed 97,619m of drilling in 386 drill holes.  On April 14, 2020, the Company released the inaugural NI 43-101 Mineral Resource estimate for the Project:  Using a 45 g/t silver cut-off-grade the estimate reported Measured & Indicated resource tonnes of 35.39 Mt at 137 g/t Ag for 155.86 Moz and Inferred resource tonnes of 9.84 Mt at 112 g/t Ag for 35.55 Moz (see News Release dated April 14th for details).  Highlights of the Resource Estimate are as follows:
Mineralization starts at or near-surface and is amenable to potential open-pit mining extraction:  Approximately 70% of the resources are within 200 m of the conceptual open pit surface.
Favourable initial metallurgical test work indicates laboratory-based recoveries of up to 97% for the various oxide – transition and sulphide mineral domains (see news release dated August 23, 2019 for details).
Resource estimate excludes the recently discovered Snake Hole zone where drilling intercepted 72.4 m grading 279 g/t Ag (see news release dated January 13, 2020 for details).
Mineralization remains open to the North and South and at depth. No feeder zones or source intrusions have been discovered to date.
During the first quarter of 2020 the Company’s field operations were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Company took immediate steps to protect the health and safety of its employees and to ensure full compliance with the applicable rules and recommendations.  During this period, the Company developed and implemented protocols to protect its workforce and is continuing to provide assistance to the communities neighbouring the Project by donating medical, hygiene and food supplies as part of our ongoing social responsibility program.  The 2020 drill campaign was suspended in  late March and the Project placed on care and maintenance. A total of 2,388m of drilling had been completed at Silver Sand during the quarter prior to the suspension. Field operations are expected to resume following receipt of authorization from the government of Bolivia.
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, total expenditures of $2,395,286 and $10,932,321, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 - $1,040,108 and $7,634,047, respectively) were capitalized under the project for expenditures related to the 2019 drill campaign, site and camp service and construction, and maintaining a regional office in La Paz, a management team, and workforce for the project.
In December 2019, the Company announced the acquisition of a 98% interest in the Silverstrike Project from an arm’s length private Bolivian corporation (the “Vendor”) by making a one-time cash payment of US$1,350,000.  Under the agreement signed between the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary and the Vendor, the Company will cover 100% of the future expenditures of exploration, mining, development and production activities.  The agreement has a term of 30 years and renewable for another 15 years without any payment and is subject to an approval by Bolivia’s Jurisdictional Mining Administrative Authority (Autoridad Jurisdiccional Administrativa Minera or “AJAM”).
The Silverstrike Project is located approximately 140 kilometres (“km”) southwest of La Paz, Bolivia at an elevation of 4,000 to 4,500 m.  The Silverstrike Project consists of nine ATEs with an area of approximately 13km² currently in the process of conversion to Mining Administrative Contracts before AJAM.  The Vendor has also applied for exploration rights over areas surrounding the Silverstrike Project as part of the transaction.
For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, total expenditures of $421,925 and $427,127, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 - $nil and $nil, respectively) were capitalized under the project for expenditures related to camp construction/rehabilitation, maintaining a management team and workforce for the project and initial field work.
