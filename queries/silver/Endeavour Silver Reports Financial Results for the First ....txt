VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May  08, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE: EXK; TSX: EDR) released its financial results today for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company operates three silver-gold mines in Mexico: the Guanaceví mine in Durango state, the Bolañitos mine in Guanajuato state and the El Compas mine in Zacatecas state.
Bradford Cooke, Endeavour CEO, commented, “We are gratified to see that our operational performance improved significantly in the First Quarter, compared to both Q1 and Q4, 2019, in-line with our guidance prior to the government mandated suspension of mining operations. Notably, consolidated cash cost declined 37% year on year, reflecting the success of our operational turn-around and transition to higher grade orebodies at Guanacevi. All-in sustaining cost fell 5%, reflecting the elevated sustaining capex we invested to achieve a similar turn-around at Bolanitos over the next three months.”
“Almost half of our net loss was due to the 25% devaluation of the Mexican peso, which devalued our receivables and caused a deferred income tax expense.  Other extraordinary items included elevated care and maintenance costs at El Cubo which will decline going forward, and high mine depletion due to short reserve lives. Since the Mexican government has decreed that suspended businesses located in municipalities with low or no COVID-19 cases can start up again May 18, and each of our three mines are located in such municipalities, we are looking forward to putting our mines back into production in May.”
Revenue: Total $21.9 million from the sale of 665,500 oz of silver and 7,454 oz gold at average realized prices of $15.33 per oz silver and $1,633 per oz gold.
Cash Flow: Negative $5.0 million cash flow from operations before working capital changes as the Company accumulated finished goods, invested in exploration activities and incurred a significant foreign exchange expense from the depreciation of the Mexican peso.
Net Income: Loss $15.9 million ($0.11 per share) due to reduced sales, increased depreciation and depletion related to current short reserve lives and significant foreign exchange expense as the depreciation of the Mexican peso impacts the value of VAT receivables and other working capital accounts. EBITDA(1) was negative $6.7 million.
Balance Sheet: Cash position $15.0 million and working capital $27.2 million.  Only term liabilities are equipment loans of $11.5 million to upgrade mobile fleet.
Metal Production: Produced 857,659 oz silver and 8,476 oz gold, in line with guidance prior to government mandated suspension of mining operations, for 1.5 million oz silver equivalent (AgEq) at an 80:1 silver:gold ratio (January) or 1.8 million oz AgEq at 110:1 ratio (current).
Operating Costs: Cash cost(1) $7.85 per oz payable silver and all-in sustaining cost (AISC)(1) $18.38 per oz payable silver, both net of gold credits. Cash cost was substantially lower than Q1, 2019 due to reduced operating costs at Guanacevi, partly offset by increased operating costs at El Compas and the suspension of El Cubo.  AISC was slightly lower than Q1, 2019 a result of lower operating costs partly offset by, increased exploration costs and elevated capital expenditures at Guanaceví and Bolanitos.
Guanacevi Outperformed Plan: Operating costs declined and productivity improved with rising production, tonnes and grades due to the operational turnaround and transition to mining the new, higher-grade El Curso, Milache and SCS orebodies.
Advanced Terronera Project: Conducting a final PFS optimization in-house working with an independent engineering firm to achieve enhanced economics.
(1) Mine operating cash flow, cash costs and all-in sustaining costs are non-IFRS measures. Please refer to the definitions in the Company’s Management Discussion & Analysis.
In Q1 2020, revenue decreased 22% to $21.9 million as a result of 18% lower silver equivalent production year on year due the suspension of operations at the El Cubo mine and the accumulation of metal inventory partly offset by higher gold prices compared to 2019.  As a result of the lower production, mine operating cash flows, operating cash flows and EBITDA all decreased compared to Q1, 2019. The Company recognized a loss of $15.9 million compared to a loss of $13.3 million in Q1, 2019.
Cost of sales for Q1, 2020 was $24.8 million, a decrease of 27% over the cost of sales of $33.8 million for the same period of 2019.  The 27% decrease was primarily related to the 20% decrease in tonnes processed, carrying larger finished goods inventory and implementing cost cutting and efficiency measures in 2019.  The goals of the 2019 remedial actions were to reduce operating costs and generate free cash flow at current metal prices.  Management notes that these actions have had a very positive impact on Guanacevi mine operating performance and a similar turn around is underway but not yet finished at Bolanitos. Management continued to invest in long term viability of the mines with additional equipment purchases, accelerated mine development and increased site exploration.
The Company recognized a foreign exchange loss of $4.9 million in Q1, 2020 compared to a foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million in Q1, 2019 due to the depreciation of the Mexican Peso which resulted in lower valuations of peso denominated tax receivables and cash balances. The Mexican Peso depreciated more than 25% due to the global COVID crisis.
For the period ended March 31, 2020, the Company generated net revenue totaling $21.9 million (Q1, 2019 - $28.0 million). During the period, the Company sold 665,500 silver oz sold and 7,454 oz gold at realized prices of $15.33 and $1,633 per oz respectively, compared to sales of 1,069,385 oz silver and 9,559 oz gold at realized prices of $15.50 and $1,315 per oz respectively in the same period of 2019. The Company increased its finished goods silver and gold inventory to 279,320 silver oz and 1,452 gold oz, respectively at March 31, 2020 compared to 95,028 oz silver and 587 oz gold held at December 31, 2019.
After cost of sales of $24.8 million (Q1, 2019 - $33.8 million), mine operating losses amounted to a $2.9 million (Q1, 2019 – loss of $5.8 million) from mining and milling operations in Mexico.
Excluding depreciation and depletion of $6.0 million (Q1, 2019 - $7.1 million), stock-based compensation of $0.1 million (Q1, 2019- $0.1 million) and the inventory write off of $1.1 million (Q1, 2019- $3.2 million) mine operating cash flow before taxes was $4.3 million in Q1, 2020 (Q1, 2019 – $4.6 million). Operating losses were $8.6 million (Q1, 2019 – loss of $12.2 million) after exploration expenditures of $2.4 million (Q1, 2019 – $2.3 million), general and administrative expense of $2.0 million (Q1, 2019 – $3.0 million) and El Cubo care and maintenance costs of $1.3 million. Net loss amounted to $15.9 million (loss of $0.11 per share) compared to a net loss of $13.3 million (loss of $0.10 per share) in Q1, 2019.
Direct production costs per tonne in Q1, 2020 decreased 4% compared with Q1, 2019 due to improved operating cost at Guanacevi, offset by the higher cost of El Compas and the suspension of El Cubo.
Consolidated cash costs per oz, net of by-product credits (a non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute) decreased to $7.85 primarily due to lower operating costs per tonne, higher gold grade and the higher realized gold price compared to the same period in 2019.  All-in sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) compared to Q1, 2019, decreased 5% to $18.38 per oz in Q1, 2020.  This decrease in all‑in sustaining costs was a result of lower operating costs partly offset by increased exploration at each operation and increased capital expenditures at Guanaceví and Bolanitos.
