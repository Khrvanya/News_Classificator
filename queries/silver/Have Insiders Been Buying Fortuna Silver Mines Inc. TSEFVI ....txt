Have Insiders Been Buying Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. (TSE:FVI) Shares?
Simply Wall St February 23, 2020
It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. ( TSE:FVI ).
It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company. However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.
Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. As Peter Lynch said, ‘insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.
President Jorge A. Ganoza Durant made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$589k worth of shares at a price of CA$3.55 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of CA$5.21. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn’t tell us much about what they think of current prices.

I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. From our data, it seems that Fortuna Silver Mines insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about CA$7.5m. Overall, this level of ownership isn’t that impressive, but it’s certainly better than nothing!
