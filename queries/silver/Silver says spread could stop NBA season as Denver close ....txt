Nuggets coach Michael Malone said this month that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus in March, while center Nikola Jokic tested positive in Serbia last week.
The New Orleans Pelicans said on Tuesday that three of their players had also tested positive for COVID-19.
"They're not in 'quarantine'. They're in self-isolation and they test daily," Pelicans executive vice president David Griffin said. "When they can have two negative tests – or rather tests that are good results for us – they can return to activity with the team."
Last week, the league said 16 of 302 players had tested positive for COVID-19 and were in self-isolation.
Serbian centre Nikola Jokic reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 last week.
When the season resumes July 30 at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex, the Nuggets will start with a 43-22 record, placing them 1.5 games behind the second-placed Los Angeles Clippers and 1.5 games ahead of fourth-placed Utah in the Western Conference play-off race.
The Pelicans, who had a 28-36 record before the season was suspended, will kick off the season restart July 30.
NBA commissioner Adam Silver, meanwhile, says any spread of the coronavirus would prompt him to shut down the season.
"I'll say of course when we designed this plan, we were not seeing the kind of increases in cases, frankly not just in Florida and Texas but at least of the last few days, the majority of states in the United States are seeing increases in COVID cases," Silver said.
"Our model was designed for this. Our model was designed to protect us and our players from the cases in the outside community. Maybe at the time we designed it, we didn't think it would be as necessary as it is now but at least we are preparing for it."
