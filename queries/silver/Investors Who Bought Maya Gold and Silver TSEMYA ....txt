The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. For instance the Maya Gold and Silver Inc. ( TSE:MYA ) share price is 231% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! Meanwhile the share price is 1.2% higher than it was a week ago.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company’s share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During three years of share price growth, Maya Gold and Silver moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.

We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Maya Gold and Silver’s earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
Maya Gold and Silver shareholders are down 28% for the year, but the market itself is up 5.7%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn’t be so upset, since they would have made 13%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we’ve discovered 4 warning signs for Maya Gold and Silver (1 doesn’t sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
