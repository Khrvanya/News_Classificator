“In the first quarter of 2020, Maya saw significant operational challenges at its flagship Zgounder Silver Mine. With new management arriving in Q2, a review of the Company’s assets is ongoing. A turnaround plan to optimize operations and an aggressive drill program at the Zgounder Silver Mine over the next 24 months is being implemented. We believe that Zgounder holds tremendous potential, but we continue to manage operational challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic,” said President and CEO Mr. Benoit La Salle.
The following includes some of the financial highlights for the quarter:
Revenue from silver sales totaled $525,062 in Q1/2020 including an adjustment of silver concentrate sales, compared with $2,067,397 in Q1/2019. Revenue was down as a result of logistical issues ancillary and related to the COVID-19 pandemic. An additional 14,884 oz were stolen and could have otherwise contributed $254,574 to revenue.
Net loss of $435,733 in Q1/2020, compared to a net gain of $304,745 in Q1/2019. Net loss for the quarter was attributable to reduced gross margin and an increase in management and administration expenses.
Operations generated a negative gross margin of $49,946 in Q1/2020, compared to $556,534 in Q1/2019.
Comprehensive loss of $3,727,902 in Q1/2020, compared to a net gain of $1,061,225 in Q1/2019. The majority of this loss or $3,292,169 in Q1/2020 was attributable to a foreign currency translation loss compared to a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 756,480 in Q1/2019.
Cash flows from operating activities of $93,531 in Q1/2020, compared to $2,652,083 in Q1/2019.
Cash position of $14,831,283 as at March 31, 2020 compared to $16,621,291 at March 31,2019.
A total of 1,3076.6 m of DDH and 378 m of RC drilling was done at the Zgounder property for exploration purposes.
A total of 899 m of DDH was done at the Boumadine property, all in the North pit starting at surface. Analyses are pending.
The Company several issues at its Zgounder Silver Mine, which affected the production and sale of silver. The flotation plant was shutdown for the entire month of January because of an issue at the Company’s old tailings facility. The new tailings facility was only commissioned in March, which allowed the Company to return to normal production after commissioning. Given the flotation plant was temporarily shut down, all ore was treated at the cyanidation plant. Given the Company intended to produce mainly silver concentrate, maintenance at the cyanidation plant had been significantly reduced. This caused silver recovery to be 45.6% in Q1/2020 compared to 65.3% for Q1/2019. As maintenance was re-initiated, recovery subsequently improved. Silver grade fed to the mill was 223.1 g/t Ag in Q1/2020 compared to 219.8 g/t Ag in Q1/2019.
On January 20th, 14,884 ounces of silver ingots were stolen at the mine site. Local authorities were notified, a full report was conducted, and suspects were identified. The Company is currently in discussions with insurers to recover the value of the stolen goods. Discussions with the insurer have been slow due to COVID-19 related restrictions in Morocco. Authorities have since increased security at the mine site and management estimates a low probability of reoccurrence. No employees or contractors were seriously injured as a result of the robbery.
Silver sales in Q1/2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ground transportation and customs were significantly slowed during the quarter and as such only 21,110 ounces of silver ingots were sold.
Exploration at the Zgounder Silver Mine continued in Q2/2020, but slowed toward the end of the quarter because of COVID-19 restrictions. Exploration restart is planned for Q3/2020.
The ongoing exploration and drilling program at the Zgounder Silver Mine has three main objectives including: i) to continue to define the eastern portion of the deposit, ii) to determine the existence of a mineralized extension to the east of the deposit and iii) to determine mineralization at depth of the current mining areas. Both RC and DDH drilling are being used. In Q1/2020, 378 m of RC were drilled in the far eastern part of the deposit – including three holes totaling 850 m of DDH drilling from surface in the eastern part of the deposit, and four holes totaling 456.6 m of depth from DDH drilling. Two additional holes were drilled in the eastern zone resulting in high grade intervals with ZG-19-07 intercepting 3.5 m at 614 g/t and ZG-19-08 intercepting 5 m at 592 g/t.
“We are transitioning to the next phase of development and growth and continue to review our operations and implement a plan to optimize operations and maximize value at both the Zgounder Silver Mine and the Boumadine Polymetallic Project” said Benoit La Salle. “We are integrating internal policies and have added a highly experienced team to improve performance and deliver value for our shareholders.”
