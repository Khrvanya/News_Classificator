"My friends at @tudorwatch just released a new Black Bay," he wrote in the caption. "Love the blue details on the #BB58 #BornToDare."
In recent posts, the Inter Miami CF co-owner has rocked a shaved look akin to what he wore years ago.
But in his latest picture, he appeared to have switched it up with a longer, dyed style.
"New hair?" asked one follower.
"Nice hair," said another, alongside a pair of fire emojis.
"Looks quite smart on him," a third observed.
Your hair is looking on point!
"I love the silver hair," another wrote, adding: "Suits you lots."
David's style often comes under scrutiny on Instagram.
Last week, he drew attention to it himself by telling fans about his latest disagreement with his wife, Victoria .
The ex Manchester United star posted a snap taken during a relaxing walk through the countryside near his Cotswolds home.
It showed him looking happy and relaxed in a pair of brown trousers, a loose green polo shirt and a comfortable-looking cardigan featuring a bold, colourful pattern.
He also wore a flat cap and leaned on the tall stick he likes to take out on his walks.
