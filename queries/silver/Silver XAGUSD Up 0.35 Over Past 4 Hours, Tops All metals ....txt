The silver price increase is causing a substantial price increase. I am also going to get help from a jeweller to polish them due to currently being on maternity leave which also pushes the price up a bit.
@Dioclet54046121 @2020Upstream @goldmarketgirl @DebraG_Robins Have lately been wondering whether $silver price movement is more insightful about the future than gold. If silver can break out sustainably above $19 then it’s all roses for gold. Until then something is holding all #preciousmetals back?
