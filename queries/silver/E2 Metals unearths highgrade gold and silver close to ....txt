E2 Metals identified 8m at 7.64g/t gold and 216g/t silver at the Mia prospect which is on trend of Cerro Vanguardia.
During a short scout drilling program, E2 Metals (ASX: E2M) has unearthed up to 36.8 grams per tonne gold and 1,108g/t silver at the Mia prospect within its Conserrat project, which is close to AngloGold Ashanti’s Cerro Vanguardia mine in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province.
E2 carried out a five-hole scout drilling program at Mia, which is 15km along trend of Cerro Vanguardia.
The program unearthed 8m at 7.64g/t gold and 216g/t silver from 76m, including 1m at 36.8g/t gold and 1,108g/t silver from 78m.
E2 noted the drill hole terminated in mineralisation with the final reverse circulation drill sample grading 4g/t gold and 22g/t silver.
Mineralisation at Mia has now been defined over 280m of strike and remains open to the north-west.
“The Mia results are outstanding at this early stage of exploration, displaying grades and thickness typical of a high-grade ore shoot,” E2 managing director Todd Williams said.
“The results underscore the potential of Mia and the host structure that extends for over 2km to Patricia and Florencia, in addition to the district veins at Conserrat that remain untested.”
E2 noted that planned drilling to test mineralisation at more favourable depths had been halted due to COVID-19 restrictions.
E2’s priority Conserrat project encompasses 8,696 hectares and is 130km north-west of Puerto San Julian.
According to E2, Conserrat is centred on the same structures that host the Cerro Vanguardia operation which has historical and current reserves of 8.9 million ounces of gold and 137Moz silver.
During the March quarter, E2 completed a 10-hole reverse circulation program at Conserrat, which identified mineralisation at the Veta Blanca prospect.
Better results at this zone were 3m at 4.43g/t gold and 49g/t silver from 38m, including 1m at 10.2g/t gold and 91g/t silver from 39m; and 9m at 0.85g/t gold and 7.5g/t silver from 21m, including 1m at 3.66g/t gold and 14.2g/t silver from 23m.
