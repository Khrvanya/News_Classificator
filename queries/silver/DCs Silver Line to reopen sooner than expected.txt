Friday morning rail transit news:
DC Metro Silver Line service to resume Aug. 16
DC Metro will restore Silver Line rail service and reopen six stations in Fairfax County, Va., as of Aug. 16, weeks ahead of the original September estimate for reopening. The agency announced Thursday that the earlier reopening reflects progress on station platform repairs that will allow trains to pass through the East Falls Church station by mid-August, and work will be complete on the portion of the “phase 2” extension project to Dulles Airport that required temporary suspension of rail service. Stations to reopen are McLean, Tysons Corner, Greensboro, Spring Hill, Wiehle-Reston East, and West Falls Church.
Sacramento Regional Transit will begin enforcing California’s face mask requirement , notifying customers on its website that, as of Monday, June 29, anyone without a qualifying exemption will be denied service if they attempt to use light rail or bus service without a mask. The Sacramento Bee reports that the agency has started giving out masks to those who request them, is passing them out at major stations, and has plans to make them available upon boarding.\
Houston’s Metropolitan Transit Authority is now requiring masks for riders on its light rail and bus system, a requirement approved unanimously on Thursday by a vote of Metro’s board of directors. The rule follows an order issued on June 19 by Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo requiring everyone over the age of 10 to wear masks when working at or visiting a business or commercial property. That order is in effect through June 30. In the wake of the mask rule and other safety measures, Metro also announced it would resume collecting fares as of July 12.
