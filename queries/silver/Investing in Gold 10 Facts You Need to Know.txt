Gold can soar in value during hard times, when investors are fearful and uncertain and seek safety. Just look at the rise in prices amid the spread of COVID-19. Gold has appreciated by roughly 9% from the start of 2020 through April 22, while stocks have delivered a 12.4% loss with dividends included.
The 21st century has given gold several opportunities to shine. The turmoil that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and continuing through the 2008-09 economic meltdown was bullish for gold investors.
Concerns about the health of many European economies and soaring budget deficits and political uncertainty in the U.S. pushed goldâ€™s price to an all-time closing high of $1,895 in September 2011.
