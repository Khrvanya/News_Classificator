Moreover, the fact that the world’s population is increasing is a good thing from an economic point of view, according to Rule.
“More people, and more people becoming slowly or rapidly more prosperous, increases demand for natural resources,” he said. “So that’s the good news — the ascent of man and particularly the ascent of the bottom of the demographic pyramid.”
But from a macro perspective, there is plenty of bad news to consider. For Rule, the economic expansion that the world enjoyed after the 2008 liquidity crisis was a 10 year expansion that is very long in tooth.
“I would suggest to you that that expansion was due to come to an end anyway, as a consequence of its age, as a consequence of its artificiality … that 10 year economic expansion was driven as much by excess liquidity, by quantitative easing and by artificially low interest rates as it was by any expansion in world trade or individual productivity,” he explained.
That’s why in Rule’s opinion the coronavirus pandemic was more of a catalyst than a cause of the current economic situation.
“My own sense is that the V-shaped recovery that we have seen in equity, and particularly (in) debt markets, is more a consequence of manipulation and in fact outright purchases by the Fed, than it is any sense of economic strength,” he added.
For investors interested in jumping into the markets, Rule said the place to start is precious metals because right now “the wind is in the sails” of precious metals.
“Gold markets traditionally have moved for many reasons, but in my 45 year experience the most important reason is a decline or a lack of faith in government securities,” he said. “And that lack of faith has manifested itself, and so the gold price has begun to move.”
Looking back at prior recoveries from oversold bottoms, gold has moved first and gold equities have moved later. “Silver also moves after gold, but generally moves further and faster,” he said.
