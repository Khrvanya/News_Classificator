The story in gold remains the same: prices  appear to be headed much higher. The breakout from consolidation about a week  ago continues to hold; support has not failed yet. Gold is forming a cup and  handle pattern, which indicates a much bigger move is coming. We expect that  move will be higher and gold should break through $1,800 August futures as it  prepares to make a run at the all-time highs.
Silver is setting up a similar pattern to gold,  just not quite as bullish but with the possibilities of breaking out big. The  key for silver is a close above $18.20 September futures, which would probably  take the metal to $20. Of course, there is work to be done, but silver is  bullish. It would be no surprise to see soon silver start to outperform gold.
After rallying the last couple of days, platinum looks ready to head lower once again. The high for this move would be  $840 October futures, which would keep platinum in a downtrend. Our first  target on the way down $800 support that breaks $770 and then $750 October  futures.
Our algorithms have been dead on the charts,  which keeps us long gold, silver, and short platinum. All three appear to be solid  patterns and should see a continuation in their current direction.
Saturday Micro Mini Recording: Saturday did a great  webinar on our micro mini futures portfolio models. I have attached the  recording for your viewing pleasure.
