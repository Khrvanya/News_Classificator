If we are going by the leaks, Even Blass coined that the Galaxy Watch 3 will hold a price tag between $400 to $600. Since Samsung is competing against the likes of Apple Watch, the pricing does make sense. Moreover, previous models of the watch also saw an increase in price year over year. However, if this is true, the jump this year is significant.

The original Galaxy Watch featured a price tag of $329 for the 42mm version and $349 for the 46mm. It could be possible that Samsung is differentiating its Galaxy Watch Active 2 pricing scheme with the Galaxy Watch 3.
Apart from this, we heard about the Galaxy Watch 3's firmware and most of the watch faces that will be coming with it. You can check out the leaked watch faces as well. Other details include a preloaded Spotify app, Microsoft Outlook instead of Samsung's Mail app, a new weather app, revamped music widget, "Information Edges", and more.
What do you think about the Samsung Galaxy 3 price? Do you think it will compete with the like of the Apple Watch?
