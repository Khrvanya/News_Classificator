Today we look at Silver Mines’ recent reply to an ASX price query and the relationship between gold and silver.
The ASX sent a price query letter to SVL yesterday which said:
‘We note the change in the price of SVL’s securities from a low of $0.045 on 15 July 2019 to a high of $0.062 today, 18 July 2019. We also note the significant increase in the volume of SVL’s securities traded from 16 July 2019 to 18 July 2019.’
It was a sharp increase but one which Silver Mines says can be explained by the recent movement in the silver price.
They note that, ‘The silver price has increased by approximately US$1.50 per ounce (10.3%) since 16 June 2019. Since 16 July 2019, the silver price has increased from approximately US$15.30 per ounce to a high of approximately US$16.32 per ounce (6.7%).’
You can see what has been happening with the gold/silver ratio recently:
It has come down from as high as 93 with silver’s recent charge, but is still well above the long-term average.
With silver demand in the auto sector (EVs) and solar cells projected to increase, there could be something more sustained behind silver and Silver Mines’ recent rise.
