The price of gold jumped 2.14 per cent to reach a record high on Tuesday on the expectations of further monetary easing by developed countries to prevent their economies from going into recession. This is supporting the yellow metal’s safe-haven appeal amid falling interest rates, and thereby returns from other asset classes.
