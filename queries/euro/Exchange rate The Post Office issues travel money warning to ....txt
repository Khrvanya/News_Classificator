Coronavirus in Belarus: Is it safe to travel to Belarus?
A Post Office spokesperson added: “Whilst travelling abroad is not at the forefront of people’s minds right now, we want to remind Travel Money Card holders who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic that they may have foreign currency sitting on their card right now that can be transferred to Pounds to help with day to day expenses.
“For Britons who are stuck abroad at the moment and who already have our Travel Money Card it can still be loaded with foreign currency to help navigate expenses incurred trying to get home.

However, for those Britons who hold foreign currency in cash, experts have said it’s best to simply hold on to the money at this time.
Ian Strafford-Taylor, CEO of Equals (formerly known as FairFX), said: “We’ve found that on average people return from holiday with around £177 worth of leftover currency.”
“For those using prepaid currency cards, they can spend their money back in the UK online or in stores, keep it for their next trip, or change it to a different currency altogether.”

Sacha Zackariya, CEO, Change Group International Plc, also agreed exchanging money may not be wise right now.
“Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to change your foreign currency at this point.
“I would, therefore, recommend holding on to this leftover currency until your next holiday or if it is somewhere you are unlikely to travel again then exchange it at a later date.
