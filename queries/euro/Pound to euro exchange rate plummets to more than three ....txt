THE POUND to euro exchange rate plummeted to a three-month low yesterday as it struggled with plans for economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic. But is it set to improve today?

“It fell to a more than three-month low as month-end flows and concern over how the UK will fund the significant fiscal stimulus programmes involved in the economic recovery mounted.
“Those stimulus measures will be the primary focus today, with attention centring on a keynote speech from PM Johnson on the post-covid economy.”
Currently, foreign holidays are still not allowed.
