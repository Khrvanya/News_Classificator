Against the euro, the dollar has risen by 3.5 per cent since Jan 1.
And collapsing oil prices have helped the dollar appreciate against the Russian ruble, Canadian dollar and Norweigan krone, economies all deeply reliant on petroleum.
The US dollar already was already highly valued thanks to the health of the economy - to the annoyance of President Donald Trump, since a strong currency also makes American exports more expensive against competitors.
Trump felt that made it more difficult for US firms compete with China as the two countries fought a trade war, and he relentlessly called on the Federal Reserve to cut the benchmark interest rate.
With the onset of the crisis and the shutdown of huge portions of the economy, the Fed last month cut the rate to zero.
Some observers believe the upheavals caused by the coronavirus could reshuffle the cards dealt to the world's two largest economies and jepardise the dollar's position.
"The supremacy of the greenback will come into question in the weeks ahead," said BK Asset Management's Kathy Lien.
Investors have been betting that the global recession will be deeper than the US downturn, and that other countries won't emerge as quickly as the US.
"While that may be true, we've seen data turn south for many countries weeks ago. In the US, we're only beginning to see the Covid-19 impact on national data and in some cases, the numbers are still dated," Ms Lien said.
While a jobless report for March saw unemployment tick up to 4.4 per cent, that data does not capture all of the jobs destroyed in the month.
Weekly data released showed an alarming 10 million people applied for unemployment benefits in the second half of March, as the pandemic slammed the US.
