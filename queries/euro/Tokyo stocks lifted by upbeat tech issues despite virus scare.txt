TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo shares ended higher Friday as gains led by chip-related issues pushed aside concerns about the economic impact from a resurgence of coronavirus infections in the capital.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 160.52 points, or 0.72 percent, from Thursday at 22,306.48. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 9.57 points, or 0.62 percent, higher at 1,552.33.
Gainers were led by precision instrument, miscellaneous product, and information and communication issues.
In the currency market, the U.S. dollar steadied in the mid-107 yen zone on expectations of a U.S. economic recovery after data showed overnight a record increase in nonfarm payrolls in June following the initial impact from the pandemic. But concerns remain about another setback given a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
At 5 p.m., it fetched 107.48-49 yen compared with 107.45-55 yen in New York and 107.47-49 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Thursday.
The euro was quoted at $1.1234-1236 and 120.75-79 yen against $1.1234-1244 and 120.77-87 yen in New York and $1.1280-1281 and 121.23-27 yen in Tokyo late Thursday afternoon.
Japanese government bonds drew buying as investors fled to the relative safety of the debt on persistent fears about a further escalation in the pandemic, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond 0.020 percentage point lower from the previous day's close to 0.020 percent.
Tokyo shares advanced throughout the day, helped by robustness on Wall Street after the strong jobs data.
They met some selling in the afternoon on media reports that new infections with the virus in Tokyo topped 100 for the second consecutive day. But the Nikkei held out in positive territory.
"The scale of the outbreak in Tokyo is much smaller than in the United States and other countries," said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co.
On the First Section, advancing issues outnumbered decliners 1,333 to 759, while 78 ended unchanged.
Technology issues drew strong buying as they are seen as resilient even during the pandemic because people are spending more time online, brokers said.
Semiconductor equipment makers notably gained ground. Screen Holdings soared 170 yen, or 3.4 percent, to 5,120 yen, Tokyo Electron grew 790 yen, or 2.8 percent, to 28,720 yen, and Advantest was up 130 yen, or 2.1 percent, at 6,330 yen.
SoftBank Group climbed 148 yen, or 2.6 percent, to 5,778 yen after shares of Lemonade, the U.S. insurance startup the Japanese investment giant backs, more than doubled in value on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Panasonic, the battery supplier to Tesla, fell 0.70 yen, or 0.1 percent, to 942.00 yen as profit-taking kicked in after it briefly rose 1.5 percent on strong vehicle sales in the second quarter reported by the Silicon Valley carmaker, brokers said.
Trading volume on the main section fell to 982.46 million shares from Thursday's 1,357.25 million shares.
