The Euro 2020 version of eFootball PES 2020 will allow gamers to play their own version of UEFA's European Championship and they will be able to do so with any of the federation's 55 member teams.
All the latest kits and squads were to be made available in the official download, with additions such as Saint Petersburg Stadium and Wembley Stadium, the latter of which is due to host the semi-finals and final.
As part of the immersive experience, the game update will have the official matchday ball of Euro 2020, as well as a realistic representation of the tournament trophy - the Henry Delaunay cup.
How can I get the eFootball PES Euro 2020 game?
In order to play the Euro 2020 eFootball PES game, gamers are usually required to download a free update and that may still be the case for eFootball PES 2020.
However, with eFootball PES 2021 expected to launch at some point in 2020, it is possible - even likely - that Euro 2020 will be an integral feature and selling point of the new game.
Konami had also committed to making a retail version available to purchase, but that was cancelled following the postponement of Euro 2020.
When will Euro 2020 take place?
Euro 2020 will now begin on June 11, 2021 and conclude on July 11, 2021.
The tournament had originally been scheduled to take place in June and July 2020, but UEFA was forced to postpone due to the severity of the global coronavirus pandemic.
