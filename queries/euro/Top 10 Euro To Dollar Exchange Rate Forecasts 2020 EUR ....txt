The Euro-to-dollar exchange rate is seen trading 0.7pct higher on the day, quoted at around 1.08746  on Tuesday, April 7.
"The US dollar was broadly softer as risk sentiment improved, while the euro focus is on today’s Eurogroup meeting." say Lloyds analysts.
Exchange Rates UK Research team have compiled a roundup of expert FX views on the current EUR/USD outlook from 10 leading FX analysts.
"The EUR/USD short-term technicals are neutral - The common currency has taken a break from its recent slide to settle around the 1.08 mark since early-Friday, which has acted as a key level since the start of the year and will likely limit further declines for the moment. A clear, sustained, break below this support would likely see the EUR aim for its year-to-date low of 1.0636. Upside action looks limited for the euro and it may not gather the momentum to cross above 1.0850 soon. Resistance is 1.0835.."
"After failing to hold our upper support region, prices extended towards the last line of support around 1.0745 before the 1.0635 previous lows. A rally back through 1.0870-1.0910 resistance is needed to suggest a higher low over 1.0635 is trying to develop, for a move back to 1.1170 and maybe 1.14-1.15. Otherwise, risks remain to the downside, but 1.0635-1.0600 is still seen as strong support for now.
While we had hoped to see a broader recovery from 1.0635, current price action is not conducive at this stage, as such, we need further evidence that a longer-term base is trying to form. A break of 1.0600 opening a move closer to the 1.0340 previous lows from 2017."
"While Europe is starting to see some results from the lockdown measures, the question about the policy response to the economic impact remains very open. Today, EU members will hold another conference call where the “Southern bloc” (led by Italy and Spain) will once again push for a common debt instrument. With EUR/USD enjoying a rebound thanks to some dollar weakness (why may linger, as highlighted above), EUR bulls will hope EU members can offer a catalyst for a more extended rally. For now, the Dutch and German reluctance to eurobonds seems to be a key obstacle, so it remains to be seen whether any alternative options will convince markets to eventually price out the risk of another European debt crisis."
"The USD is losing ground again as demand for safe-haven currencies is declining for the time being. Markets are expecting the virus to spread at a noticeably slower pace, so the focus is gradually shifting towards finding any glimmer of hope. Currently, the focus is on the spread of the virus and the death rate, i.e. any decline in the numbers increases the willingness to take risks. However, excessive optimism would be entirely inappropriate as the peak of abysmally poor economic data is far from being reached."
"It could be argued that (almost) all major central banks are printing the bottom out of their own currencies currently, why the Fed would need to “out-print” the rest of the pack to really weaken the USD. The total fiscal policy response from the US is likely to be bigger as a percent of % US GDP, than e.g. the comparable response from Spanish, Italian and French authorities, which will allow the Fed to print at a higher pace of GDP than ECB. On the other hand, it could be argued that investors are not convinced that e.g. Italy and Spain will at all be able cope with the economic consequences of prolonged curfew scenarios. At least the EUR didn’t take it well, when Spain prolonged the lock-down until 26th of April. Corona bonds would in our view be a massive EUR/USD buy signal. We think the USD will be markedly weaker 9-12 months from now, but we aren’t overly convinced of selling USD versus EUR right now as curfews are likely to be tightened rather than eased in major economies in the next few weeks still."
"Lockdown measures continue to be more likely to be extended than shortened. An agreement on a joint-EU economic reponse could support sentiment, and prevent EUR rates following their USD peers lower."
"The highly valued dollar is vulnerable after the loss of its interest rate advantage, EUR/USD should appreciate in the medium term."
"Next Tuesday next test for EUR – we have discussed the political risks in the EU Rising on its response to the Covid19 crisis in recent days – the next key test is the Eurogroup meeting (of EU finance ministers) next Tuesday.  EURJPY and EURUSD perhaps equally viable options for testing risks of existential cracks opening up again the in euro, even if the ECB is keeping the evident risk in sovereign bond spreads within the EU, etc. very orderly at the moment. The EURJPY pair is a bit closer to the key cycle lows over the past couple of sessions down around 116.00-25."
"Monthly forecast, April 2020 Downtrend The downtrend may be expected to continue, while pair is trading below resistance level 1.1235, which will be followed by reaching support level 1.0793 and if it keeps on moving down below that level, we may expect the pair to reach support level 1.0605. Uptrend An uptrend will start as soon, as the pair rises above resistance level 1.1235, which will be followed by moving up to resistance level 1.1502 - 1.1632."
"Euro/dollar continues its fall lower this morning as traders angst about the upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls report. So much for the choppy range trade we were expecting earlier this week. The market has been one directional ever since the 1.1140s buyer failure we saw last Sunday night. Monday and Tuesdays EURUSD sales were blamed on month end/quarter end flows; its all been about new coronavirus-induced economic fears since then, and traders are totally ignoring the glut of dollars that have been created in the swap/repo markets. We think a NY close below the 1.0770s would be very bearish for EURUSD heading into next week. Over 1.3blnEUR in options expire between the 1.1750 and 1.1775 strikes at 10amET this morning."
"The euro is the worst performing of the forex majors in the past week. It remains under pressure today and looks to be set for further weakness. We have spent much of this week talking about downside breaks, and lower highs and lower lows. Once more today, the story is the same. Momentum indicators have turned corrective across the board, with bear crosses on Stochastics (around 50) and MACD lines (under neutral) whilst RSI is falling into the low 40s. A run of decisive negative candles is growing and intraday rallies are a chance to sell. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement (of $1.1492/$1.0635) at $1.0835 is an initial basis of support/consolidation point, but if this were to be breached decisively then a full retracement back towards $1.0635 should not be ruled out. The hourly chart shows the top completion under $1.0950 which implies a target area of $1.0750/$1.0760 which is the next support area. With support around $1.0900 breaking yesterday, this has been retested and held as resistance, so there is a key area of near term sell-zone for any technical rallies now between $1.0900/$1.0950. This week’s downtrend sits at $1.0930 this morning. The hourly RSI suggests rallies are failing between 50/60 now, again sell-zone territory. Initial support under yesterday’s low at $1.0820 is at $1.0785 and then towards $1.0750."
