FCP Euro to miss Virginia, Sonoma
Front-running outfit FCP Euro has announced that it will sit out the next two rounds of the TC America season.
The Volkswagen team, which took both the drivers’ and teams’ championships last year, hs taken the decision to miss the season restart at Virginia International Raceway in July and Sonoma Raceway in early August.
The move comes as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with most of the race team being made up of employees from FCP Euro’s core car parts business.
“We’re disappointed to have to make such a decision,” Nate Vincent, FCP Euro Director of Motorsport – and driver of the #72 Volksagen – said. “Ultimately, the health and safety of our employees, partners, and team members are paramount.
“We have been extremely fortunate to be able to continue operating throughout this pandemic thanks to our dedicated employees and loyal customers. Servicing our customers and keeping our employees safe is our number one priority, and as soon as we feel there is minimal risk to our employees and customers, we will return to racing.
“We will continue to take each race on a case-by-case basis, and we hope to see our fans and rejoin our fellow competitors on track in TC America soon.”
A further three rounds of the season are scheduled to take place after the Sonoma weekend.
