Euro poised to overcome early-2020 downtrend, exposing the 1.12 mark
The Euro is flirting with breaking its 2020 downtrend after launching a recovery from a three-year lowagainst the US Dollar ,as expected . A daily close above support-turned-resistance in the 1.0992-1.1009 area would violate the series of lower highs set from the beginning of the year,
In this scenario, EUR/ USD seems likely to have scope for a test of back-to-back resistance levels running up through the upper bound of recently broken upward-slowing support set from October 2019, now recast as resistance. Closing above that – now just below 1.12 – appears to be a pre-requisite to make the case for lasting upside follow-through.
Zooming out to the weekly chart, the longer-term downtrend in play since mid-2018 remains firmly intact. This paints recent gains as broadly corrective, at least for now. Traders may thus treat the rise as a selling opportunity if concrete signs of topping appear to take shape at trend resistance.
