Currently, foreign exchange volatility looks low. A combined long Guggenheim currencyshares Japanese (FXY), short Guggenheim currencyshares euro trust (FXE) pair looks compelling.
• It looks like SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) trust will be stuck in a $248-$287 range until clarity emerges on the coronavirus treatments and/or economic normalcy. That does not appear to be happening anytime soon. With the VIX still in the 40s, expiries need to be kept short and spreads make sense. Because the VIX is currently range bound and staying elevated, it is likely a friend as it is confirming that risks remain high.
• In the fixed income space, iShares Barclays tips bond fund (TIP) trailed iShares 20+ year Treasury bond ETF (TLT) in Q1 by about 21%. However, since the equity trough on March 23, iShares Barclays tips bond fund (TIP) is outperforming 3.14% to 2.28%. iShares Barclays tips bond fund (TIP) is a medium duration asset that gets almost all its return from inflation. The Q1 underperformance was likely the idea that inflation would go to zero. Remember, there are no negative provisions in inflation protected securities. There is hope that states reopening might continue to give inflation protected securities an advantage over regular treasuries, as activity pick up and prices recover. The Fed, and global demand for treasuries, could keep US nominal rates low while a return to inflation from very accommodative monetary policy and a rebound in the economy could support iShares Barclays tips bond fund (TIP) returns. I think you must be long iShares Barclays tips bond fund (TIP) here given that scenario. The market seems to agree and leans slightly bullish at 0.61 std deviations below its mean.
• With gold having its best run since 2011, SPDR gold trust (GLD) looks to be getting a second wind. Investors should take note of the metal’s surge away from its DMAs. Global stimulus packages and monetary profligacy got juiced yesterday, with the reports that the ECB is considering a 2.2 Trillion Euro support program. The ECB will likely be using high yield bonds as collateral under their program, similar but different to the Feds step into the high yield space. These steps look to weaken the Euro and are part of a what looks to be a coordinated global central bank trend to enhance liquidity. Liquidity is just another word for dilution. When fiats expand, gold has the tendency to shine. SPDR gold trust (GLD) is up 10.55% since 3/23, and while ISHARES SILVER TRUST has outperformed SPDR gold trust (GLD) in that time, ISHARES SILVER TRUST’s greater correlation to industrial activity with much higher realized (30 day) volatility (SPDR gold trust (GLD) -34 vs ISHARES SILVER TRUST-65) makes SPDR gold trust (GLD) a better bet.
• The Guggenheim currencyshares Japanese (FXY) long combined with Guggenheim currencyshares euro trust (FXE) short looks set to expand its gap. The long Yen short Euro trade has earned 2.51% since the 3/23 equity trough. One look at the charts confirms that safety investors are more comfortable with Japan’s risks than the EU’s, a hypothesis we agree with. A target of Guggenheim currencyshares euro trust (FXE) $99 and Guggenheim currencyshares Japanese (FXY) $94 by year end looks to be suitable from these levels. Options trades in the short- to medium-term set up well as noted above, as extending the maturities too long is too expensive to justify. Guggenheim currencyshares Japanese (FXY) leans bullish at 0.88 std devs below its mean, while Guggenheim currencyshares euro trust (FXE) hints at some downside risk (1.41 std devs above its mean).
