The analysis illustrates how important it is to have a properly diversified portfolio of investments around the world rather than focusing on your home market.
Currency movements have a significant impact on investment returns, so spreading a portfolio across different regions helps to protect against a big decline in one currency, and can deliver additional gains when the domestic currency falls.
If you succumbed to the temptation of 'home bias' and lumped most of your money in UK shares then you would not see these benefits.
Sacha Chorley, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, explained further: 'When your own currency weakens the natural instinct is often to assume this will have a negative impact on your investment portfolio.'
'As this analysis shows that isn't always the case and in fact it can be beneficial for globally diversified investors. While the pound has fallen rather spectacularly as the threat of a no deal Brexit looms large, investors with sterling denominated overseas assets have enjoyed a "Brexit boost" to their returns.'
'What this data does show is that it is crucial investors don't have a home market bias, and instead look to diversify their portfolios with a healthy allocation to global equities,' Chorley continued.
'Just as international companies offer exposure to a diverse range of business opportunities, international currency exposure can offer exposure to a wide range of economic opportunities and help reduce unintended domestic biases. As proven, the difference in returns can be hugely significant.'
