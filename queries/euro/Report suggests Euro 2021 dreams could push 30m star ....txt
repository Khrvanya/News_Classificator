Julian Draxler could leave Paris Saint-Germain to fulfil his Euro 2021 dream with Germany, with BuzzSport giving Arsenal fresh hope of signing one of the game’s finest playmakers.
If Mesut Ozil is unwilling to get his act together at the Emirates, then there is a another World Cup-winning schemer who could be ready to take the place of his bench-warming, dust-collecting compatriot in north London.
Fussball Transfers reported in May that Arsenal are big fans of £30 million PSG ace Draxler.
And while you might scoff at the idea of leaving the dominant force of French football for a team sitting tenth in the Premier League, things are not as simple as ‘my club is better than your club’.
Draxler is fully aware that, if he wants to play a key role for Joachim Low when the European Championships finally get underway next summer, he needs to strut his stuff on the football pitch far more regularly.
The former Schalke and Wolfsburg wonderkid started just seven Ligue 1 games this season.
And with Kai Havertz, Julian Brandt, Serge Gnabry, Marco Reus and more threatening to keep him out of the Germany side, a repeat of 2019/20 must be avoided.
Arsenal would certainly give Draxler, who captained his country to Confederations Cup glory in 2017, the stage such a talented thespian requires.
But, as BuzzSport pointed out last month, his £120,000-a-week wages and sizeable transfer fee might just leave him stuck in limbo at the Parc des Princes.
Arsenal are not exactly flushed with cash these days either.
