Currency pairs are the foundation of forex trading. Whenever you purchase one currency you sell another. Every pair has a base currency, in this example EUR (Euro) and a quote currency, or USD (US Dollar).
A currency pair represents how much quote currency, or USD (US Dollar), that needs to be spent in order to purchase one unit of EUR (Euro), the base currency. In the current example you would need to spend 1.129184 of USD (US Dollar) in order to purchase 1 EUR (Euro).
Forex pairs can be broadly separated into three categories; the majors, the commodity currencies, and the cross currencies:
Major currencies are the most traded currencies on the market. Which currencies make the cut will vary, but almost all lists will include EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF
Commodity currencies are currency pairs where their value is closely tied to a commodity such as oil, coal, or iron ore. Examples include AUD/USD and USD/CAD
Cross currencies are currency pairs which don’t include USD. Examples include EUR/GBP and EUR/JPY.
