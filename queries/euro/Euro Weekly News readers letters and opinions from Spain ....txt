I am a UK citizen, resident in Spain for a number of years. Spain has dealt well with the pandemic, instructions to the public have been brief and clear and from what I have seen locally the public has been abiding by them.
The medical system appears to have done their job and I have no complaints though I know some have complained about how strict lockdown is and was. The point is they took action to get the job done no matter if some of it was unpopular they made the hard decisions.
In contrast, the UK is a shambles. I am a Conservative supporter but the Govt has been totally inept and cowardly in their decisions, it is not a popularity contest, making the tough decisions and leadership seems beyond them.
The UK is now in the position of more deaths in a week than all 27 EU countries combined.
The blame lies at the feet of an impotent, incompetent Govt.
Those who may think I am being “disloyal” to my home country need a reality check. It would be stupid to praise Boris and co for this mess just because they are British.
If the cap fits etc.
I just hope this dithering and lack of decision making doesn’t cost more lives.
Clarity, brevity and make the tough decisions, that’s what they are there for.
