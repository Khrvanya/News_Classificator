The match schedules for the Men’s U19 WFC 2021 European Qualifications have now been published.
The European qualifications will be held in two tournaments, in Italy and Poland, from 11th – 15th November 2020. Details of both events can be found by clicking on the group name below (EUR1 / EUR2).
For the final round, 3 teams from these European events will qualify – the winner of each group plus the best 2nd placed team.
The Asia-Oceania qualification is scheduled to be held in Singapore from 12th – 17th October 2020, however, COVID-19 travel restrictions are still in place throughout the region so alternatives are being discussed with the organiser and participating teams.
USA & Canada will play in the Americas qualification at a time and place yet to be confirmed. Originally, the event was to be played in Birmingham, Alabama, in August, but COVID-19 restrictions have made this not possible so alternative plans are being looked at.
A total of 28 teams have registered for the 11th Men’s U19 WFC to be played from 28th April – 2nd May 2021 and hosted by defending champions, Czech Republic. The event will be held in Brno, in Vodova Arena – the same venue that hosted the Women’s WFC in 2013. In the qualifications, Singapore will play their first Men’s U19 event since 2005, while China will compete in their first.
Nine teams (all from Europe) are directly qualified based on results from U19 WFC 2019 , while the remaining 7 spots will be decided in regional qualifications – with 3 from Europe, 3 from Asia Oceania, and 1 from the Americas going through to the Final Round.
The Final Round will be played with 16 teams and there is no longer A- & B-division. The teams will be divided into four groups in one division based on ranking and a ballot. Groups A/B and C/D are divided according to ranking (based on results from U19 WFC 2019) and a group ballot will be held after the qualification events to decide the final four groups.
