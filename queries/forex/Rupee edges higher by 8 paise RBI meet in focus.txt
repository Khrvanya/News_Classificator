India's GDP growth hit an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent in July-September 2019, dragged mainly by deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity, according to official data released on Friday.
"This week, market participants will be keeping an eye on RBI Policy statement and could consider cutting rates for sixth time this year. We expect the USDINR(Spot) to quote in the range 71.70 and 72.20," Somaiyaa added.
Bankers and experts believe the Reserve Bank may cut interest rates for the sixth straight time on December 5 to support growth that has continued to slip.
The RBI has cut interest rates on every single occasion the monetary policy committee (MPC) has met since Shaktikanta Das took over as the Governor in last December.
