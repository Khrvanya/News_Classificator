Despite the market turmoil , the London-listed broker continued to execute its share buyback program.

Therefore, from Monday until Thursday this week, Plus500 has purchased 112,077 shares in total and spent an approximate amount of £1,254,343.60. For the whole week, these figures are likely higher, as any purchase of shares for today has not yet been made public.
Since February, when Plus500 first announced its latest share buyback program, the company’s shares have been on a general upward trend, largely due to the fact that the broker has been benefitting from heightened volatility in the financial markets as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Today, however, the company’s share price has dropped.
As Finance Magnates reported , Plus500 achieved strong revenues for the first quarter of 2020. In particular, when comparing Q1 of 2020 revenues, which was $316.6 million, against the same period of the previous year, this is a 487 per cent yearly increase. The latest share buyback program of Plus500 follows the completion of the firm’s previous buyback program , which commenced in August of last year, in which it repurchased $50 million worth of shares. The original announcement of the buyback program came on the heels of a poor set of half-year financial results for the retail broker.
