As reported by Finance Magnates Plus500 is currently thriving, with the coronavirus pandemic providing a boost to its operations, as volatility has caused a surge in trading activity.
In the first quarter of 2020, Plus500 achieved “exceptional Q1 revenues”, according to the company. When comparing Q1 of 2020 revenues, which was $316.6 million, against the same period of the previous year, exceptional might just be the right word, as this is a 487 per cent yearly increase.
Because of this solid performance, Plus500 shares have been on the rise since the middle of March this year, rising from GBX 731.20 on the 16th of March, to GBX 1162.50 as of the 16th of April, 2020.
