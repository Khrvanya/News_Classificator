Thomas Book was appointed as Member of the Management Board of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange by the Exchange Council. He will take over the Chairmanship of the Management Board, succeeding Hauke Stars, who will leave Deutsche Börse on 30 June and resign from the Management Board.
Book has worked for Deutsche Börse for 25 years and is Executive Board Member for Trading & Clearing, which includes the derivatives exchange Eurex, Eurex Clearing, the foreign exchange trading platform 360T and the energy and commodity business of EEX Group. As of July 1, the cash market business, including the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, will be added to his responsibilities. This will bring together all Deutsche Börse’s trading and clearing platforms in one division.
The further members of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Management Board are Martin Reck (Deputy Chairman), Cord Gebhardt and Michael Krogmann.
The Management Board of a stock exchange acts as a management body for the public administration assigned to the stock exchanges. It ensures compliance with the regulations of stock exchange laws and, in particular, the orderly conduct of stock exchange trading. It can issue administrative acts and is therefore an authority in the sense of administrative law.
