Cassini, from Valenza, a city of about 20,000 in northern Italy, has been living in the western Grand Forks County town of Larimore since the beginning of the school year.
Cassini had planned to leave Larimore in early June but now will stay until July because he doesn’t want to return to his native country until the coronavirus pandemic has quieted.
Cassini chose to stay the extra month at the advice of his father, who is a physician in Italy.
“He told me ‘You can’t even imagine the situation here,’" Cassini said. ‘“He told me, if I came back to Italy, I could get the coronavirus."
