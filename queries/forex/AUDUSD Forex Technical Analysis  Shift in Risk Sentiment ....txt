Based on the early price action, the direction of the AUD/USD is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the 50% level at .6877.
After drifting lower shortly after the opening, the Australian Dollar reversed to the upside to move higher for the session in reaction to a jump in shares in Europe and the United States. The early pressure was fueled by stock market weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. The catalyst for the early selling pressure was concern over the jump in U.S. coronavirus cases.
At 09:10 GMT, the AUD/USD is trading .6887, up -.0052 or -0.76%. This is up from a low of .6811.
Fears of a second wave of COVID-19 in Australia also led to the early weakness. A spike in coronavirus infections pushed Australia’s second-most populous state, Victoria, to extend its state of emergency for four more weeks to July 9 on Sunday.
The rebound rally in the Aussie was primarily driven by a shift in risk sentiment. This occurred when U.S. stock index futures turned higher after a weaker opening.
