It explained that there is a law against such practices, but business owners in Ghana continue to flout such directives.

Per a report by citibusinessnews.com, he added that such violations would be punished in accordance with the law.
People found guilty could be convicted and fined up to 700 penalty units or imprisoned for up to 18 months, or both.
