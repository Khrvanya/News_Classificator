Positive Trump comments on potential trade deal.
Forex markets could react positively at opening on Monday.
Phased deal looks the most likely. Phase one to be signed soon.
US President Donald Trump has delivered the most positive news in quite some time to the forex market . This comes in the form of his Tweet regarding a productive talk with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant trade deal” came the news from the President’s Twitter account on Friday.
This development would be substantial and very positive in terms of how the USD forex market and economy, in general, could react. The two sides have been deadlocked on a potential deal for some time. Both superpowers have instead engaged in tit-for-tat sanctions in what is seen as generally negative for both sides.
How will Monday’s forex market react?
Views from around the sector are all pretty much unanimously of the view that the USD forex market will react positively to the news. There has been little in the way of good news lately for the market. The GBP/USD pair saw it’s biggest losses in many years before markets closed for the weekend. This is despite the positive signs shown when Boris Johnson’s conservative party romped to victory in the previous week.
All things considered, most traders and analysts alike will be expecting a risk-on rally to take shape when the markets open for business Monday. This type of rally is often seen when investors anticipate a high risk/reward payoff and the market sentiment is showing positive signs.
It is fair to say that the reaction coming from Beijing and Xi has been much more muted. Although phase one of a deal has been all but agreed, the Chinese leadership still had some causes for concern during the call. President Xi noted the continued US interference in issues surrounding Hong Kong, and Taiwan in particular. These are issues which Beijing considers to be Chinese domestic affairs, something which was made clear.
“US behaviors have interfered in China’s internal affairs and harmed China’s interests, which is detrimental to mutual trust and bilateral cooperation.” This was the word quoted from Xinhua Chinese state news agency. That aside, this is the first step of cautionary progress.
This is phase one of the deal which looks set to hold off at least $160 billion of tariffs on Chinese made consumer goods which has already been implemented. Both sides are said to have agreed on further phases of the deal. This will no doubt be positive news for the forex market and general economies of both. Many are skeptical though of any true deal actually emerging. The general thought is this announcement serves the political interests of both at the moment. Trump, of course, has his reelection campaign on the horizon. China, on the other hand, has the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. The next chapter is poised to play out.

Major currencies in the forex market are trading slightly lower today. Both the Euro, and Pound have dropped back against the Dollar as concerns over a spike in Coronavirus numbers persist. The final UK GDP figures for the first quarter released today, were also worse than expected. Meanwhile, US markets are looking quiet after a strong rally to open up the week on Monday. This may change as the day progresses and today’s testimony from the Fed Chairman is digested.
Forex trading in the GBP/USD market today was struggling below the 1.23 mark for a number of reasons. One of the major points which seems to have rocked trader confidence in Sterling is the release of GDP figures for the first quarter today. These show a 2.2% drop in GDP, worse than had been expected.
This GDP drop is the largest the nation has seen in more than 40 years. It is compounded by the fact that a double digit drop is expected in the next quarter, and also the fact that a new spike in cases has led to local lockdown in at least one British city. British leader Boris Johnson is due to speak later today where he will introduce plans to inject more than £5 billion into infrastructure in a bid to bolster the economy.
The EUR/USD is looking to end the quarter in successful territory today although that has been threatened by negative pressure which has pushed the pair down at the beginning of the day. Forex brokers noted that traders are appearing to favor a move back toward the safety of the US Dollar.
This move has largely been led by the uncertainty of the US economic situation as several states have now moved to impose renewed restrictions, or halted their reopening plans as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise again in many areas. This has been the case in New York who have slowed reopening, as well as in Texas and Florida where renewed closures have been put in place on many bars and restaurants after cases in those states showed a heavy increase.
Today’s market opening on Wall Street would appear to have hit a lull following yesterday’s great surge to begin the week. The Dow Jones rose more than 500 points yesterday to get the week off to a very positive start. The picture today, pre-market numbers have indicated, is much less active. Many could be awaiting the remarks of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who will address the House Financial Services Committee later today.
These remarks are expected to raise more questions than answers though, with Powell set to comment that the path forward remains very uncertain, and reliant on successfully containing the virus.
As you gain experience trading the forex market , you will come across an increasing number of terms. One such term is a currency swap. These kind of transactions actually make up for a large amount of the volume traded on the markets, and they are commonly applied in a few situations when you are trading forex . Here we will explain in more detail exactly what currency swaps are, how they usually occur, and why they can be beneficial to certain types of traders in the sector.
In the most simple of terms, a currency swap does exactly as the name implies. It is an exchange of currency between two parties of the equivalent amount of money in another currency. There is then a contract in place to repay this money at a specified date, and exchange rate in the future. In essence, this is a currency swap. A currency swap can bear some similarity to that of currency futures, though they differ in the sense that they are held until settlement, and considered to be a large part of forex trading , whereas currency futures are traded on other exchanges.
Party A, and Party B enter an agreement to swap €1,000,000 for $1,150,000. This fills the need for the counter currency for both parties, and creates an implied EUR/USD exchange rate of $1.15.
The transaction is then completed at a future defined date, using either the original exchange rate of $1.15, or another agreed upon exchange rate. Essentially, the two parties are loaning a particular foreign currency to each other. In some cases with currency swaps, this can include the payment of interest or principal amounts on loans, though this will depend on the details of the individual agreement.
Who Typically Engages in Currency Swaps?
Currency swaps used to be the preserve of those in countries where the foreign exchange rates were extremely volatile, or as where they could be used as a mechanism to overcome currency restrictions.
While this is still the case on a more limited basis, the use of currency swaps has increased around the world as investors and companies become increasingly multinational. Here are a couple of examples of where currency swaps are most often used to good impact in today’s forex market.
Companies Doing Business Abroad: Currency swaps may be particularly beneficial to businesses who have interests abroad and need to borrow in order to conduct this business. They may not necessarily benefit from favorable loan terms from banks outside their home country. Therefore, if they can borrow money in their home country at the best terms, and conduct a currency swap with a similar company in the country they are seeking to invest, then this trade could be of benefit to all involved.
Volatile Currencies: A currency swap may be beneficial, an almost essential in some cases, for institutional and retail investors in nations where the local currency is known to be volatile. This is one of the main purposes behind engaging in a currency swap, to guard against currency risk with more volatile currencies. By engaging in a currency swap, both parties can set the terms, and have a certainty around the cost of their trade.
As we can see with these examples, currency swaps are most often used by companies, and other types of institutional investors. This is certainly a more common situation than the use of currency swaps by retail investors, although in some situations, retail forex traders can be impacted.
While currency swaps can be beneficial in the most part for the points noted above, just like any form of trading, they are not completely without risk. If you are engaging in a currency swap, here are a couple of the primary risks you can expect to encounter.
Interest Rate Fluctuation: One of the main purposes of engaging in a currency swap may be to take advantage of better interest rates in the currency that you are borrowing as part of the deal. These interest rates though are often left floating in contracts. Therefore, there is a chance that a change in the exchange rate could negate any of the cost-saving benefits you hoped to derive from the currency swap in the first instance.
Exchange Rates: With currency swaps, perhaps the most important element is the exchange rate. This is often pre-defined within the swap contract to be a set rate at the future time when the deal reaches maturity. Here again, there is a chance that the future rate is worse for one party than the original or current rate. In this case, there may be a slight loss on the swap.
The term swap fee, or forex swap is something you will also encounter if you are an online forex trader. This can also be known as the overnight fee, or rollover fee, and may sometimes be confused with the currency swap.
This is a “fee”, though it can be either positive, or negative, that is applied to positions you hold open overnight when trading through your forex broker . This amount is constantly changing, and basically represents the difference in interest rates on the currency pair which you are holding. Therefore, holding a long position in certain currency pairs will see you credited with the positive interest difference, while short positions will see this fee deducted from your balance.
Although it is typically an area of more concern for more experienced, and institutional traders, the currency swap still plays a huge role in forex trading overall, and is a very useful trade to be aware of. This is particularly true if you are looking for one of the most secure ways to deal in a large amount of foreign currency and in a situation where you wish to add some degree of security or control to the trade over a long period of time.
