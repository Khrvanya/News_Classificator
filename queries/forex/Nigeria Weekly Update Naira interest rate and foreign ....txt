The Monetary Policy Council (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) met last week and decided to leave its Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) on hold (see below). What matters is not the MPR but one-year market interest rates, which the CBN effectively sets. These rose in mid-August and, we believe, are likely to stay above 14.50% for some time.
The CBN’s gross foreign exchange reserves stand at US$42.46 billion. These have been falling at around US$400 million per week (this data comes from August and early September) as the CBN has entered the NAFEX market to supply US dollars. Spending precious FX reserves is not to the CBN’s liking, which accounts for the recent (mid-August) rise in market interest rates. A commitment by the World Bank to lend Nigeria a further US$2.5 billion is obviously welcome
The yield on a Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) Naira bond with 10 years to maturity rose by 9bps to 14.38%, and at 3 years fell by 37bps to 14.13% last week. The yield on a 364-day T-bill fell by 9bps to 15.10%. The yield on a T-bill with 3 months to maturity fell by 7bps to 12.17%.
Following the MPC meeting, headline interest rate was maintained at 13.5%, and all other metrics remained constant. A recent 1-year T-bill yield is 15.10% per annum compared with rates in July as low as 11.89%. Note that market interest rates have been rising while inflation was trending slightly down. Inflation is stubborn with the August print at 11.02% compared with July at 11.08%.

The price of Brent rose by 6.74% last week to US$64.28/bbl. The average price, year-to-date, is US$64.86/bbl, 9.53% lower than the average of US$71.69/bbl in 2018, but 18.47% higher than the US$54.75/bbl average seen in 2017.
Following the attacks on Saudi Arabia last week, there were expectations that the disruption was going to push oil prices as high as US$100.00/bbl. A rather ambitious assumption, especially as oil demand is still weak and the growth outlook of the global economy is waning. US President Trump announced on Friday that sanctions will be imposed on the Central Bank of Iran, which his administration blames for the attacks. He stated:
“These are the highest sanctions ever imposed on a country. We’ve never done it to this level.”
While this is likely to be yet another supply disruption, it is unlikely to lead to a sustained rally in oil prices, in our view.
The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index fell by 0.29% last week, pushing the year-to-date return to negative 11.87%. Last week Stanbic IBTC (+22.43%), PZ Cussons (+19.49%) and Dangote Sugar (+15.10%) closed positive while Sterling Bank (-7.23%), Forte Oil (-3.32%) and UBA (-3.17%) fell.
Although there has been a slight uptick in investors’ appetite towards equities, overall buying interest is still weak. Barring any positive catalyst, and with a year-to-date return of negative 11.87%, we expect investors to still maintain a cautious stance towards equities. However, we note that bargain hunters are in a good position to take advantage of a selected stock trading at their historical lows.
The minutes of MPC meetings, in which members give their reasons for voting several weeks after each bimonthly session, are revealing of the CBN’s motivations. At one level the CBN has a remit to develop the economy, and this can argue for low-interest rates. It also has a target range for inflation of between 6.00% and 9.00%, so an inflation print (e.g. for August) of 11.02% year-on-year remains out-of-range and may justify high-interest rates.
However, the over-riding concern (to judge from recent minutes) is to protect the Naira/US dollar exchange rate and to have sufficient FX reserves to do this with. The CBN’s FX reserve position was hard-won during 2017 and to see this fall by as much as US$400 million per week during August and early September, as the CBN supplied US dollars to the FX market, was jarring. Having allowed one-year risk-free market interest rates to fall to under 12.00% per annum during July and early August, it then raised them steeply in mid-August to around 15.50%.
The open market operations (OMO) are the CBN’s way of setting market interest rates through the sale of bills, whose yields tend to be closely matched in issues of Federal Government T-bills. Foreign purchases of these form part of the CBN’s FX reserves. The Monetary Policy Rate, which has changed just once in three years (when it was cut from 14.00% to 13.50% last March) can be considered a signalling device and a talking point for MPC discussions.
Our rule-of-thumb is that risk-free one-year Naira market interest rates need to be between 250-300bps above inflation, but our rule-of-thumb is subject to change. At the end of last week, a 1-year T-bill yielded 15.10%, 401bps above inflation.
This may be the required level at which to attract foreign institutional investors to buy Naira-denominated risk-free OMO and T-bills in the light of fairly weak oil prices and a global investment appetite which shuns risk. Our estimate is that a Naira-denominated risk-free rate of 14.75% might be enough to achieve this, implying a gentle moderation in rates. We do not expect a sharp fall in market interest rates anytime soon.

It has not been uncommon over the years to have insurance companies with pension subsidiaries.
The idea of mitigating risks and curtailing losses at the bare minimum begins from the insurance industry and only crosses into the pension space with the need for retirement planning. For this reason, it has not been uncommon over the years to have insurance companies with pension subsidiaries. However, controlling the wealth of people is no easy feat – and crossover companies are beginning to think it might not be worth it competing with the big guns; that is, the pension fund administrators (PFAs) that already cater to the majority of Nigerians.
A few months ago, AXA Mansard Insurance Plc announced that its shareholders have approved the company’s plan to sell its pension management subsidiary , AXA Mansard Pensions Ltd, as well as a few undisclosed real estate investments. It did not provide any reason for the divestment. More recently, AIICO Insurance Plc also let go of majority ownership in its pension arm, AIICO Pension Managers Ltd. FCMB Pensions Ltd announced its plans to acquire 70% stakes in the pension company, while also acquiring an additional 26% stake held by other shareholders, ultimately bringing the proposed acquisition to a 96% stake in AIICO Pension. The reason for the sell-off by AIICO does not also appear to be attributed to poor performance as the group’s profit in 2019 had soared by 88% driven by growth across all lines of business within the group.
So why are they selling them off?
Pension Fund Administration is, no doubt, a competitive landscape. Asides the wealth of the over N10 trillion industry, there is also the overarching advantage that pension contributors do not change PFAs regularly. Therefore, making it hard to compete against the big names and industry leaders that have been in the game for decades – the kinds of Stanbic IBTC, ARM, Premium Pension, Sigma, and FCMB. Of course, the fact that PFAs also make their money through fees means the bigger the size, the more money you make. With pressure to capitalize mounting, insurance firms will most likely spin off as they just don’t have the right focus, skills, and talents to compete.
The recent occurrence of PENCOM giving contributors the opportunity to switch from one PFA to another might have seemed like the perfect opportunity for the smaller pension companies to increase their market shares by offering better returns. More so, with the introduction of more aggrieved portfolios in the multi-fund structure comprising of RSA funds 1, 2, & 3, PFAs can invest in riskier securities and enhance their returns. However, the reality of things is that the smaller PFAs don’t have what it takes to effectively market to that effect. With the gains being made from the sector not particularly extraordinary, it is easier for them to employ their available resources into expanding their core business. There is also the fact that their focus now rests on meeting the new capital requirements laced by NAICOM. Like Monopoly, the next smart move is to sell underperforming assets just to keep their head above water.
Olasiji Omotayo, Head of Risk in a leading pension fund administrator, explained that “Most insurance businesses selling their pension subsidiaries may be doing so to raise funds. Recapitalization is a major challenge now for the insurance sector and the Nigerian Capital Market may not welcome any public offer at the moment. Consequently, selling their pension business may be their lifeline at the moment. Also, some may be selling for strategic reasons as it’s a business of scale. You have a lot of fixed costs due to regulatory requirements and you need a good size to be profitable. If you can’t scale up, you can also sell if you get a good offer.”
With the smaller PFAs spinning off, the Pension industry is about to witness the birth of an oligopoly like the Tier 1 players in the Banking sector. Interestingly, the same will also happen with Insurance. The only real issue is that we will now have limited choices. In truth, we don’t necessarily need many of them as long all firms remain competitive. But there is the risk that the companies just get comfortable with their population growth-induced expansion while simply focusing on low-yielding investments. The existence of the pandemic as well as the really low rates in the fixed-income market is, however, expected to propel companies to seek out creative ways to at least keep up with the constantly rising rate of inflation.
The Nigerian banking system has been through two major asset quality crisis.
The Nigerian Banking Sector has witnessed a number of asset management challenges owing largely to macroeconomic shocks and, sometimes, its operational inefficiencies in how loans are disbursed. Rising default rates over time have led to periodic spikes in the non-performing loans (NPLs) of these institutions and it is in an attempt to curtail these challenges that changes have been made in the acceptable Loan to Deposit (LDR) ratios, amongst others, by the apex regulatory body, CBN.
Projections by EFG Hermes in a recent research report reveal that as a result of the current economic challenges as well as what it calls “CBN’s erratic and unorthodox policies over the past five years,” banks are expected to write off around 12.3% of their loan books in constant currency terms between 2020 and 2022, the highest of all the previous NPL crisis faced by financial institutions within the nation.
Note that Access Bank, FBN Holdings, Guaranty Trust Bank, Stanbic IBTC, United Bank for Africa and Zenith Bank were used to form the universe of Nigerian banks by EFG Hermes.

Over the past twelve years, the Nigerian banking system has been through two major asset quality crisis. The first is the 2009 to 2012 margin loan crisis and the other is the 2014 to 2018 oil price crash crisis.
The 2008-2012 margin loan crisis was born out of the lending institutions giving out cheap and readily-available credit for investments, focusing on probable compensation incentives over prudent credit underwriting strategies and stern risk management systems. The result had been a spike in NPL ratio from 6.3% in 2008 to 27.6% in 2009. The same crash in NPL ratio was witnessed in 2014 as well as a result of the oil price crash of the period which had crashed the Naira and sent investors packing. The oil price crash had resulted in the NPL ratio spiking from 2.3% in 2014 to 14.0% in 2016.
Using its universe of banks, the NPL ratio spiked from an average of 6.1% in 2008 to 10.8% in 2009 and from 2.6% in 2014 to 9.1% in 2016. During both cycles, EFG Hermes estimated that the banks wrote-off between 10-12% of their loan book in constant currency terms.
Given the potential macro-economic shock with real GDP expected to contract by 4%, the Naira-Dollar exchange rate expected to devalue to a range of 420-450, oil export revenue expected to drop by as much as 50% in 2020 and the weak balance sheet positions of the regulator and AMCON, the risk of another significant NPL cycle is high. In order to effectively assess the impact of these on financial institutions, EFG Hermes modelled three different asset-quality scenarios for the banks all of which have their different implications for banks’ capital adequacy, growth rates and profitability. These cases are the base case, lower case, and upper case.
Base Case: The company’s base case scenario, which they assigned a 55% probability, the average NPL ratio and cost of risk was projected to increase from an average of 6.4% and 1.0% in 2019 to 7.6% and 5.3% in 2020 and 6.4% and 4.7% in 20201, before declining to 4.9% and 1.0% in 2024, respectively. Based on its assumptions, they expect banks to write-off around 12.3% of their loan books in constant currency terms between 2020 and 2022, a rate that is marginally higher than the average of 11.3% written-off during the previous two NPL cycles. Under this scenario, estimated ROE is expected to plunge from an average of 21.8% in 2019 to 7.9% in 2020 and 7.7% in 2021 before recovering to 18.1% in 2024.
Lower or Pessimistic Case: In its pessimistic scenario which has a 40% chance of occurrence, the company projects that the average NPL ratio will rise from 6.4% in 2019 to 11.8% in 2020 and 10.0% in 2021 before moderating to 4.9% by 2024. It also estimates that the average cost of risk for its banks will peak at 10% in 2020 and 2021, fall to 5.0% in 2022, before moderating from 2023 onwards. Under this scenario, banks are expected to write off around as much as 26.6% of their loan books in constant currency terms over the next three years. Average ROE of the banks here is expected to drop to -8.8% in 2020, -21.4% in 2021 and -2.9% in 2022, before increasing to 19.7% in 2024.
Upper or optimistic case: In a situation where the pandemic ebbs away and macro-economic activity rebounds quickly, the optimistic or upper case will hold. This, however, has just a 5% chance of occurrence. In this scenario, the company assumes that the average NPL ratio of the banks would increase from 6.4% in 2019 to 6.8% in 2020 and moderate to 4.8% by 2024. Average cost of risk will also spike to 4.2% in 2020 before easing to 2.4% in 2021 and average 0.9% thereafter through the rest of our forecast period. Finally, average ROE will drop to 11.6% in 2020 before recovering to 14.4% in 2021 and 19.0% in 2024.
With the highest probabilities ascribed to both the base case and the pessimistic scenario, the company has gone ahead to downgrade the rating of the entire sector to ‘Neutral’ with a probability-weighted average ROE (market cap-weighted) of 13.7% 2020 and 2024. The implication of the reduced earnings and the new losses from written-off loans could impact the short to medium term growth or value of banking stocks. However, in the long term, the sector will revert to the norm as they always do.
