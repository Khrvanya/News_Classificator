As Finance Magnates reported , on Wednesday, the London-listed broker repurchased 23,000 of its own shares, as was the case today. But, on Wednesday, the firm paid around £297,967.30 for the batch, as the volume-weighted average price per share was £12.96.
Therefore, due to a drop in Plus500’s share price, which has been falling since Monday, Plus500 paid about £3,797.3 less for the same amount of shares on Thursday of this week.
Overall, however, Plus500’s share price has had consistent upward momentum since the 16th of March 2020. The beginning of this rise coincided with the London listed broker revealing that it was benefiting from coronavirus-fuelled volumes in a trading update, which it published on March 16.
As Finance Magnates reported , it has continued to see a significantly increased level of customer trading activity since its last trading update. Specifically, the broker said: “Following the Trading Update issued on 28 February 2020, the Company has continued to see a significantly increased level of customer trading activity alongside strong momentum across all financial and operational KPIs.”
