"Recent appreciation seems like a short-term breather for the rupee, considering a rebound in global and local equities has calmed investors' nerves a bit. However, the bias still remains downwards, considering weak sentiments and that the impact of the virus will be felt in the coming quarters," said Sugandha Sachdeva, VP-Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Broking.
Sachdeva further said "for now, the rupee bulls can contend with the fact that the unit hasn't breached the crucial level of 76.25. Broadly, the rupee is likely to trade in the 75.40-76.25 band in the near term. If 76.25 mark is breached, rupee looks poised to depreciate towards 77.50 eventually."
