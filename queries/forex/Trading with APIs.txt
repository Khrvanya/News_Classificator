API stands for application programming interface. It is a program that connects two applications – for example, your IG trading account and your custom-built platform. Trading with APIs enables you to gain direct access to IG’s ecosystem, providing you with faster order execution and more control, which can enhance the experience of trading.
Trading with our APIs is an easy way to get live market data, historical prices and execute trades from any of your IG trading accounts – without having to manually trawl various exchanges and dark pools for data and prices. Instead, you can get the information delivered directly to you, ensuring speed and efficiency.
Who typically trades with APIs?
Trading APIs are popular among hedge funds and registered trading firms as they enable access to more advanced programs, but they are also widely used among private traders and investors.
