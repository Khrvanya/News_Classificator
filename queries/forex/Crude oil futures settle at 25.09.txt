The price of crude oil futures are settling at $25.09.  That's up $1.46 or 6.18% on the day.
The high price today reached $26.45, while the low extended to $23.74.
Looking at the daily chart, the settle price was below the swing low going back to 2016 at $26.05. That keeps the sellers more in control from that chart's perspective.
Zooming in the same daily chart, the rally last Friday moved through the 50% of the range since the gap lower in March at $27.81 but could not reach the 61.8% at $29.83 (the high reached $29.13 on Friday).  The closes this week have all been below the 50% retracement level.
Nevertheless, the sellers are still more in control as oil traders continue to grapple with over supply, and sharply lower demand.  It will take a move back above the 50% of the small range from the post gap lower at $27.81, to give buyers more confidence.
