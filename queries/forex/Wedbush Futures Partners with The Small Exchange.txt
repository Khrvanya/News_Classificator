The Small Exchange products will be cash-settled and initially span equities, metals, and foreign exchange in a way that is more manageable and accessible than traditional futures products. The association with Wedbush Futures will help facilitate the trade of these new products using Wedbush’s proven clearing, customer service, and technology support.
“With the official launch date of The Small Exchange approaching, we have committed to support our clients with access to the exchange on day one,” said Bob Fitzsimmons, executive vice president, Fixed Income, commodities, and stock lending at Wedbush. “Wedbush looks forward to working with The Small Exchange to continue expansion of our market access offering.”
“Having Wedbush Futures and their robust set of clearing solutions on board for our June 1 launch is key in The Small Exchange’s mission to bring futures products to more people,” said Don Roberts, The Small Exchange president and CEO. “We believe that Wedbush will help create a strong foundation for trading the Smalls.”
Based in Chicago, The Small Exchange, backed by industry innovators and powered by a proprietary matching engine, is a registered Designated Contract Market (DCM) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
