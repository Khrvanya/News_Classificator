In an attempt to revive its economy that began faltering in 2011, Egypt obtained an IMF loan in 2016 in exchange for the implementation of a rigorous reform program, beginning with floating the pound.
Implementation of the program began in November 2016. The international lender agreed to provide Egypt with a $12 billion loan in exchange for wide-ranging structural and economic reforms.
These reforms include a raft of measures such as devaluing the pound currency, loosening capital controls, ending energy subsidies, reforming public enterprises and overhauling monetary policy, all in a bid to restore economic stability and long-term growth.
