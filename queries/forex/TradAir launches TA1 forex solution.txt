Trading technology company TradAir has gone  live with a new service, TA1, to facilitate trading and liquidity in foreign exchange.
TradAir’s TA1 solution will allow its customers - both traditional and anonymous liquidity providers - to trade spot FX for an extensive range of spot currency pairs, using TradAir’s anonymous liquidity trading solution, while partnering with best-in-class credit provision from Standard Chartered, the multinational banking and financial services company.
TA1 will use state-of-the-art UX design and advanced HTML5 technology, delivering a fully personalised trading experience – both on browsers and on mobile. Workflows can be customised for trading, monitoring, risk and order management. Each transaction processes straight through to the clients’ back-office and risk systems.
TradAir has already signed several customers to TA1, and has a significant pipeline of new users for the service who are keen to access alternative liquidity providers in a seamless manor, using the breadth of Standard Chartered’s credit provision.
The partnership comes on the back of a number of recent developments at TradAir, which is developing a new suite of products and solutions, including its newly launched White Label solution using its institutional quality HTML5 FX trading solution.
CEO and founder of TradAir, Ayal Jedeikin, says: “We are delighted to be partnering with Standard Chartered, which has tremendous reach and credit- worthiness, particularly across some of the world’s most dynamic markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Collaborating with them on our new TA1 solution makes perfect sense for our customers, who are demanding ever more bespoke approaches to access seamless liquidity.”
