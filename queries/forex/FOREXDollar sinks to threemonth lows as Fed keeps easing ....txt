The Fed also did not announce any measures to cap the rise of bond yields, as some has speculated. In a press briefing, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the committee did discuss controlling the yield curve but said its effectiveness remained an "open question." The greenback fell to three-month troughs against the euro, sterling and Swiss franc after the Fed statement. It slid to a three-week low versus the yen. The Fed, in its statement, on Wednesday after a two-day meeting, repeated its promise of continued extraordinary support for the economy as policymakers projected a 6.5% decline in gross domestic product this year and a 9.3% unemployment rate at year's end. It also promised to maintain bond purchases at "the current pace" of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in agency and mortgage backed securities. "This is consistent with what the market pretty much expected, that the Fed wouldn't do anything," said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist, at Bannockburn Forex in New York. Chandler had expected the Fed to announce a yield control policy, but thought that the U.S. central bank could announce it by the end of the summer. He added that the Fed's growth forecasts suggested a V-shaped recovery. Overall, Chandler said the Fed statement showed that the dollar is still headed lower. In mid-afternoon trading, the dollar fell about 0.4% against a basket of major currencies to 95.882 , after earlier sliding to 95.714, a level not seen since mid-March. The euro, the pound and the Swiss franc all hit fresh three-month highs against the dollar. The euro rose as high as $1.1422, sterling reached $1.2812, with the dollar hitting a three-month low of 0.9425 franc versus the Swiss currency. The dollar also fell against the yen to a three-week low of at 106.99, and was last down 0.6% at 107.08 yen. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 2:53PM (1853 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Euro/Dollar EUR= $1.1383 $1.1340 +0.38% +1.54% +1.1422 +1.1324 Dollar/Yen JPY= 107.1100 107.7200 -0.57% -1.61% +107.8700 +107.0000 Euro/Yen EURJPY= 121.94 122.15 -0.17% -0.01% +122.3600 +121.5900 Dollar/Swiss CHF= 0.9433 0.9506 -0.77% -2.53% +0.9514 +0.9426 Sterling/Dollar GBP= 1.2763 1.2729 +0.27% -3.74% +1.2812 +1.2707 Dollar/Canadian CAD= 1.3385 1.3414 -0.22% +3.07% +1.3437 +1.3315 Australian/Doll AUD= 0.7015 0.6961 +0.78% -0.09% +0.7061 +0.6933 ar Euro/Swiss EURCHF= 1.0741 1.0781 -0.37% -1.02% +1.0790 +1.0728 Euro/Sterling EURGBP= 0.8919 0.8908 +0.12% +5.49% +0.8922 +0.8884 NZ NZD= 0.6545 0.6512 +0.51% -2.84% +0.6583 +0.6496 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway NOK= 9.2819 9.2639 +0.19% +5.74% +9.3782 +9.2000 Euro/Norway EURNOK= 10.5705 10.5180 +0.50% +7.45% +10.6437 +10.4550 Dollar/Sweden SEK= 9.1730 9.1716 +0.07% -1.87% +9.2520 +9.1438 Euro/Sweden EURSEK= 10.4452 10.4382 +0.07% -0.23% +10.5011 +10.4096 (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Cynthia Osterman)
