In light of the highly valued Swiss franc, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) remains willing toÂ intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market, the SNB reiterated in its Quarterly Bulletin on Wednesday.
"In its baseline scenario for the global economy, the SNB anticipates that further waves of infection will be successfully prevented."
"The SNB anticipates that, as abroad, there will be only a partial recovery for the time being, and GDP will not return quickly to its pre-crisis level."
The USD/CHF pair continues to edge higher and was last seen gaining 0.35% on the day at 0.9488.
