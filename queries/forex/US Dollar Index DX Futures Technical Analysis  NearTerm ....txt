Based on Monday’s price action, the direction of the June U.S. Dollar Index on Tuesday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the short-term 50% level at 99.690.
The U.S. Dollar rose against a basket of major currencies on Monday, helped by a rise in Treasury yields, as investors weighed attempts to reopen economies against fears of an increase in coronavirus cases that could lead to future lockdowns.
Investors were more optimistic about the economy on Monday as states across the U.S. and countries around the world have begun easing lockdown measures implemented to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which has ravaged the global economy.
At the same time, the dollar was also supported by safe-haven buying as some investors worried that the economic recovery might be slower than hoped and sought the safety of the U.S. currency even though more countries eased coronavirus lockdowns. Traders also adjusted their dollar positions with an eye on warnings of a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
