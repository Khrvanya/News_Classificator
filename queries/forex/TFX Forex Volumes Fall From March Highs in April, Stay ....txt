TFX Forex Volumes Fall From March Highs in April, Stay Strong YoY
The total trading volume of FX daily futures contracts was 2,490,865 in April.
Although heightened volatility has continued into the month of April, which has led to an increase in trading activity and volumes, data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) suggests that last month has not been quite as active as March.
The TFX offers a range of assets for futures trading – foreign exchange (forex), equities and interest rates. Overall, the combined trading volume for TFX products during the month of April was 3,905,631 contracts, with an average daily trading volume of 178,604 contracts.
When measuring this against March of 2020, which, as Finance Magnates reported , was an exceptional month for the exchange, April’s combined trading volume has fallen by 61.6 percent. However, it is worth noting that March’s performance was much higher than usual, and the trading volume posted in April is still higher by 68.4 percent on a yearly comparison.
