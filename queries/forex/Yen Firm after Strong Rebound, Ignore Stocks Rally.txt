Yen Firm after Strong Rebound, Ignore Stocks Rally
Yen surges broadly this week and remains generally firm in Asian session. Pull back in treasury yield is seen as a factor driving the Yen higher. Yet, the lack of selling in Yen despite strong risk appetite, with NASDAQ extending record run, is something to note. it might be an early hint of risk pull back and we’d find out pretty soon. Staying in the currency markets, Dollar is currently trying to recover some ground but stays the weakest for the week. Commodity currencies are generally softer in Asia together with Sterling.
Technically, Yen’s comeback is rather massive. USD/JPY’s break of 108.08 support suggests that rebound from 105.98 has possibly completed at 109.85. EUR/JPY’s touching of 121.84 minor support suggests short term topping at 124.43. 136.95 minor support in GBP/JPY is a level to watch to confirm short term topping. EUR/GBP is back pressing 0.8866 minor support and break will indicate near term bearish reversal. So, Sterling is rather mixed, caught between Yen and Euro.

USD/JPY’s fall from 109.85 extended to as low as 107.91 today. Break of 108.08 resistance turned support argue that rebound from 105.98 has completed with three waves up to 109.85. The development argues that the pattern from 111.71 is possibly in the third leg. Intraday bias is back to the downside for 107.08. Break will target 105.98. For now, risk will stay mildly on the downside as long as 109.85 resistance holds.
In the bigger picture, USD/JPY is still staying in long term falling channel that started back in 118.65 (Dec2016). Hence, there is clear indication of trend reversal yet. Break of 105.98 support would extend the down trend through 101.18 low. However, sustained break of 112.22 should confirm completion of the down trend and turn outlook bullish for 118.65 and above.
