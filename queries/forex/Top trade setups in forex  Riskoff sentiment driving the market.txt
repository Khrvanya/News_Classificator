The USD/CAD is trading bullish at 1.4120 on Friday, after testing a next support level of 1.3985. On the 4-hour time frame, the pair is trading below 50 EMA, which suggests selling bias among traders, but at the same time, the commodity currency pair has also formed a bullish engulfing candle above a support level of 1.4000.

The AUD/USD hit the fresh 2-weeks high above the 0.6100 level on the back of broad-based weakness in the U.S. dollar. The AUD/USD pair also got some support over easing concerns regarding an imminent global recession, which got highlighted after the Fed's unlimited QE and a massive $2.2 trillion U.S. economic stimulus package.
The AUD/USD is trading at 0.6069 and consolidates in the range between 0.6036 - 0.6127. The Aussie traders did not pay significant attention to the record drop in China's industrial profits. The figures slipped to down 38.3% YoY, for January-February. The reason could be the US dollar weakness. The US dollar index drops to the fresh low in seven days to 99.22 by the press time. While, the greenback is struggling to curb its recent losses and now seems to have receded, at least for the time being, which may limit the early gain in the currency pair.
As of now, the currency pair has fallen back below the 0.6100 round-figure marks. Due to the absence of any significant market-moving economic releases, the traders will keep their eyes on the coronavirus story and the USD price dynamics.
At the virus front, the United States cases crossed China figures of more than 81,000 and reached on the top of the list. On the other hand, the UK reported the highest single-day rise in the death toll by 103 to 578 yesterday.
