Home / Market News / Oil futures end higher, with U.S. prices up nearly 10% for the week
Oil futures settled higher Friday, with U.S. prices posting a gain of 9.6% for the week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies on Thursday made moves to ensure that certain countries make up for failing to fully meet their output-cut targets last month. “Kazakhstan and Iraq have pledged to improve their compliance rates in relation to the huge production cut” OPEC+ put in place at the start of May, said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “The historic cut in output was a sign the nations mean business, and now that the group is putting pressure on countries that are not fully complying, it reinforces the idea that the group are determined to boost the price.” July West Texas Intermediate oil rose 91 cents, or 2.3%, to settle at $39.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.
