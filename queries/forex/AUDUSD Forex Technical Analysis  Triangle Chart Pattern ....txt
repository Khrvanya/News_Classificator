A sustained move over .6877 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could trigger a rally into the 50% level at .6921, followed by the downtrending Gann angle at .6935. Sellers could come in on the first test of this angle. This is also the trigger point for an acceleration to the upside with the next targets coming in at .6975 and .7000.
A sustained move under .6877 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a break into the next uptrending Gann angle at .6827, followed closely by the main bottom at .6811.
If .6811 fails as support then look for the selling to possibly extend into the 50% level at .6785 and the next main bottom at .6777.
