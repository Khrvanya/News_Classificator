India’s foreign exchange reserves have gone up again, to cross $453 billion last week. This calls for some hard thinking on the part of our policymakers. When RBI intervenes to buy up dollars, instead of letting the foreign exchange market clear purely on the basis of demand and supply, the goal is to prevent the rupee strengthening overmuch.
As it is, the real effective exchange rate of the rupee is higher now than a year ago. So, this is a reasonable goal. However, as RBI buys dollars and pushes out rupees, the money supply goes up. This is potentially inflationary. To remove this risk, RBI normally carries out open market operations, selling bonds to take back rupees. However, the resultant increase in the supply of bonds pushes down their price, hardening yields. The cost of preventing overvaluation of the rupee is higher interest rates than are warranted.
At a time when growth is sagging, does the economy want higher rates of interest? The solution, then, is to discourage foreign exchange inflow. India figures among countries with the 10 largest forex reserves. Of these, only Brazil, apart from India, runs a current account deficit. All the rest are export powerhouses that run current account surplus and accumulate claims on other economies.
India’s foreign exchange reserves are capital inflows unabsorbed into the real economy, and represent liabilities. Of these capital inflows, foreign direct investment is the most desirable kind and should continue to be welcomed. External commercial borrowings take advantage of low interest rates abroad and are welcome, within prudent limits. It is portfolio flows that can be discouraged in a calibrated fashion.
Foreign portfolio inflows are welcome additions to domestic financial savings, true. But these, in excess, also push up stock prices at a time when the underlying financials are a mess, setting up the market for a fall — all the harder when the excess liquidity produced by quantitative easing in the US, Europe and Japan is sucked back in. This is the right time to clamp down on some inflows of doubtful provenance.
