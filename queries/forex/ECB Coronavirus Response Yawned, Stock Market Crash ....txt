Global stock market crash continues today as total coronavirus cases are set to break 130k level very soon. Sentiments were rocked by US unilateral ban of European travellers, which also prompted EU condemnation. US stock futures hit limit down and stocks are set to follow other markets to open with a gap low. The highly anticipated ECB announcement was some what a disappointment and triggers little reactions.
In the currency markets, massive sell-off is seen in Australian and New Zealand Dollar today, while Sterling is not far behind. Yen continues to rise on risk aversion but Dollar’s strength is worth a note. AUD/USD breaks 0.6433 support to resume long term down trend. 2008 low at 0.6008 is a medium term target, but that could be hit rather soon. GBP/USD’s break of 1.2725 support also indicates resumption of fall form 1.3514, towards 1.2552 near term fibonacci level next. EUR/USD, despite this week’s retreat, is still holding above 1.1095 support and thus stays near term bullish. We’ll see which way it’s heading to.

EUR/USD’s retreat from 1.1496 extends today but it’s staying above 1.1095 support so far. Intraday bias remains neutral and another rise is in favor. On the upside, sustained break of 1.1496 will pave the way to next fibonacci level at 1.1876. However, firm break of 1.1096 will argue that whole rebound form 1.0777 has completed. Intraday bias will be turned back to the downside for retesting 1.0777 low.
In the bigger picture, a medium term bottom should have formed at 1.0777 after drawing support from 78.6% retracement of 1.0339 (2017 low) to 1.2555 at 1.0813. Sustained break of 38.2% retracement of 1.2555 to 1.0777 at 1.1456 will raise the chance of medium term bullish reversal and target 61.8% retracement at 1.1876. Rejection by 1.1456 will suggests that price actions from 1.0777 are merely a correction. Another fall below 1.0777 low would be seen at a later stage in this case.
