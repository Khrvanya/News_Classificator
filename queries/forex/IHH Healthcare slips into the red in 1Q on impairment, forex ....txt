KUALA LUMPUR (June 29): IHH Healthcare Bhd slipped into the red in the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (1QFY20) due to goodwill impairment of RM400.5 million for Global Hospitals in India and a RM60 million foreign exchange (forex) loss relating to Khubchandani Hospitals in India upon liquidation.
The last time it reported a quarterly net loss was for 3QFY18.
The healthcare operator posted a net loss of RM319.79 million for 1QFY20, compared to a net profit of RM89.51 million a year ago. As a result, it recorded a loss per share of 3.9 sen for 1QFY20, compared with earnings per share of 0.78 sen for 1QFY19.
Stripping out the exceptional items for 1QFY20, IHH Healthcare recorded a marginal 1% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth to RM189.4 million on lower net interest expenses and lower forex losses.
Revenue for the quarter fell 2.4% to RM3.55 billion, from RM3.64 billion for 1QFY19, amid a high-base effect as the group recorded a one-off trustee management fee income of RM28.5 million previously.
IHH Healthcare managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Kelvin Loh said like all businesses, the group was impacted by the unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic.
"Still, we delivered a resilient operational performance in 1QFY20. Headline profits were affected by a thorough portfolio review and impairments of non-Fortis India investments made in 2015 and earlier.
“Our focus is on maintaining prudent fiscal discipline, driving synergies and diversifying our income streams, including with our global telemedicine roll-outs and enhanced diagnostics and lab capabilities. This will work in concert with our ongoing focus to deliver unrivalled care for patients and ensure the safety of our frontline workers who are going above their call of duty to serve their communities."
Looking ahead, Loh said the group's refreshed strategy will give it the resilience to weather the pandemic while positioning for longer-term growth.
"We will achieve this by doubling down on our vision to become the world’s most trusted healthcare services network and continuing to meet patients’ evolving needs,” he added.
Also, IHH Healthcare has started to see a strong recovery in domestic patient volumes and expects overall patient volumes to recover progressively following the gradual easing of movement restrictions starting in June.
IHH Healthcare shares closed 4.48% or 24 sen higher at RM5.60 today, bringing it a market capitalisation of RM49.15 billion. The stock saw some 1.41 million shares traded.
The stock has recovered 20% from its recent low of RM4.68 on March 17. Year to date, the stock has gained 2.4% from RM5.47 on Dec 31, 2019.
