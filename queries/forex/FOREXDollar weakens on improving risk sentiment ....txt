Wall Street's gain came after a sharp drop on Friday. “It’s a weak start for the U.S. currency, I think it’s mostly risk on,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. Investors have been weighing better economic data against a new uptick in COVID-19 infections. The global death toll from the virus reached half a million on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. Cases surged in Southern and Western U.S. states, prompting California to order some bars to close in a rollback of efforts to reopen the economy. The next major U.S. economic focus will be Thursday’s jobs report for June. U.S. employers are expected to have added 3 million jobs during the month, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters. Projections vary widely between economists, however, from as few as 405,000 jobs to as many as 9 million. The dollar index was last down 0.21% at 97.27. The greenback may get some boost from quarter-end demand later on Monday or on Tuesday, after underperforming this quarter, analysts said. The euro gained 0.47% to $1.1270. The dollar gained 0.21% against the Japanese yen to 107.44 yen. Sterling weakened to a one-month low against the greenback on concerns about how Britain's government will pay for its planned infrastructure program. There are also doubts about whether Britain will seal a trade pact with the European Union as little progress has been made in agreeing Britain's future relationship with the bloc, which it exited on Jan. 31. The pound was last down 0.26% at $1.2301. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 9:33AM (1333 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Euro/Dollar EUR= $1.1270 $1.1217 +0.47% +0.54% +1.1288 +1.1218 Dollar/Yen JPY= 107.4400 107.2100 +0.21% -1.30% +107.4600 +107.0500 Euro/Yen EURJPY= 121.10 120.27 +0.69% -0.70% +121.1800 +120.1800 Dollar/Swiss CHF= 0.9465 0.9479 -0.15% -2.20% +0.9481 +0.9442 Sterling/Dollar GBP= 1.2301 1.2333 -0.26% -7.23% +1.2389 +1.2301 Dollar/Canadian CAD= 1.3673 1.3688 -0.11% +5.29% +1.3697 +1.3646 Australian/Doll AUD= 0.6856 0.6860 -0.06% -2.35% +0.6890 +0.6844 ar Euro/Swiss EURCHF= 1.0670 1.0634 +0.34% -1.68% +1.0674 +1.0636 Euro/Sterling EURGBP= 0.9160 0.9093 +0.74% +8.35% +0.9171 +0.9085 NZ NZD= 0.6416 0.6423 -0.11% -4.75% +0.6442 +0.6408 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway NOK= 9.6737 9.6625 +0.12% +10.20% +9.7315 +9.6492 Euro/Norway EURNOK= 10.9045 10.9059 -0.01% +10.84% +10.9309 +10.8540 Dollar/Sweden SEK= 9.2873 9.3297 -0.02% -0.64% +9.3527 +9.2752 Euro/Sweden EURSEK= 10.4728 10.4753 -0.02% +0.03% +10.5105 +10.4540 (Additional reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft in London)
