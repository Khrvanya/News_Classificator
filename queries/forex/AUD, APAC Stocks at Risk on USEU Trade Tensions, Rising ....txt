AUD, APAC Stocks at Risk on US-EU Trade Tensions, Rising Virus Cases
Australian Dollar , Asia-Pacific stocks may fall on geopolitical strains, rising Covid-19 cases
Wall Street ended the day on a downbeat note after a slew of sentiment-souring factors blew a chilling, bearish wind across markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices closed 2.5. and 2.19 percent lower, respectively, with the industrial-leaning Dow Jones index taking the biggest hit at 2.72 Percent. Crude oil prices suffered their worst one-day decline since June 11 and may have contributed to dragging down the petroleum-linked NOK.
The cycle-sensitive New Zealand, Australian and Canadian Dollars closed in the red, while the anti-risk US Dollar , Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen grazed on green pastures. CAD ’s decline was exacerbated after Fitch Ratings downgraded Canada’s credit rating to AA+ with a stable outlook. The demotion came from concern of a deterioration in the state’s public finances in light of the extraordinary measures taken to combat Covid-19.
The source of the risk-off tilt in market mood appeared to have in part come from fear about a second spike in coronavirus infections as certain areas in the US continue to rise at alarming rates – particularly Texas. The other element of risk aversion came amid news of renewed cross-Atlantic trade tension between the US and EU. The White House is weighing imposing new tariffs on $3.1 billion of exports from key EU countries.
