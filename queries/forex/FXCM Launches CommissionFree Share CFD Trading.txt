Margin foreign exchange broker FXCM has launched commission-free single-stock CFD trading (share CFDs), enabling retail clients to trade CFDs on individual company shares like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, and others. It will be gradually rolling out the new single stock CFDs to its entire client base over the coming weeks, the firm announced today.
The expansion into share CFDs will initially focus on stocks listed in the United States, according to FXCM.
The company aims to expand the number of individual stocks tradeable via CFDs to more than 100, covering at least five countries, all before the end of the year.
FXCM says that it will provide share CFD trading on MetaTrader 4, the Trading Station platform, and on mobile devices, resulting in seamless connectivity for existing customers and reducing the need to switch between providers.
