The online contracts for difference (CFD) trading provider said back in February that it plans to repurchase $30 million as part of its share buyback program. The latest share buyback program will run from February 12, 2020, up until August 31 this year. However, the program might end earlier on the date of the announcement of the company’s interim results for the six months ending June 30, 2020.
Since the program was announced, many of the company’s top executives have been buying up the company’s shares. As Finance Magnates reported , Alon Gonen, a Co-Founder of Plus500, has purchased millions of pounds worth of the company’s stocks.
Last month, from March 20 until the 24th, Gonen purchased approximately £4.63 million worth of the online CFD firm’s shares. This is in addition to the £4.17 million worth of shares he purchased on March 2, 2020, as Finance Magnates reported .
