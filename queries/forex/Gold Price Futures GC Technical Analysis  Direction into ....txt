Gold prices are lower on Monday, but a stock market rebound has helped the precious metal recover some of today’s earlier losses. Stocks were trading sharply lower in the pre-market session, triggering a flight to safety rally into the U.S. Dollar. This pressured demand for dollar-denominated gold.
At 16:52 GMT, August Comex gold is trading $1727.30, down $10.00 or -0.58%.
As stocks began to recover from their earlier losses, investors began to shed the safe-haven dollar, driving up foreign demand for gold.
Gold also began the session on a week note, following the announcement from the CFTC that speculators cut their bullish positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to June 9. Some traders said that fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections helped underpin the market.
