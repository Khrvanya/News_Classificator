How do prepaid travel cards work?
Prepaid travel cards can be a convenient way for travellers to exchange and access their money overseas.
It works just like a debit card where you can pay electronically or make cash withdrawals, however you load the card with particular or multiple currencies before you leave and while you are travelling as well.
A handy feature of these cards is that often you can lock in an exchange rate for foreign currencies on the day you load the card. This means that if you need to load more money on the card later on, you’ll receive the same rate as you did the first time around.
And while you can take your regular debit card overseas ,, the downfall is that you can’t lock in an exchange rate. Instead, you are subject to whatever the exchange rate is on the day you make a purchase with the card - which may be higher or lower than the day before.
Just bear in mind though, prepaid travel cards do come with a range of fees from purchase, reload, cross currency and closure fees, so it’s worth weighing up whether it’s suited for the type of travel you are doing.
