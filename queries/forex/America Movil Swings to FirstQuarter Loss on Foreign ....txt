MEXICO CITY—Telecommunications heavyweight América Móvil SAB swung to a heavy net loss in the first quarter, despite higher sales and operating income, as the depreciation of the Mexican peso pushed up its financial costs.
Latin America’s biggest wireless operator by subscribers, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, reported a net loss of 29.4 billion Mexican pesos ($1.2 billion), equivalent to 45 Mexican cents a share or $0.45 per American depositary receipt. In first quarter of 2019, net profit was 19.6 billion pesos.
