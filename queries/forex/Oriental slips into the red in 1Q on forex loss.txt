KUALA LUMPUR (June 29): Oriental Holdings Bhd slipped into the red in the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (1QFY20), mainly due to a foreign exchange loss on yen-denominated borrowings by the plantation segment.
It posted a net loss of RM396.09 million, compared to a net profit of RM80.62 million a year earlier. This resulted in a loss per share of 13.18 sen for 1QFY20, compared to earnings per share of 15.02 sen for 1QFY19.
Revenue for the quarter dropped 31.2% to RM956.38 million, from RM1.39 billion previously, mainly attributed to a lower contribution from the automotive segment by RM409.5 million. This was due to a lower number of cars sold by retail operations in Malaysia.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, the Penang-based diversified group said revenue from the automotive segment — its biggest revenue contributor — fell by 40.4% to RM604.5 million for 1QFY20, from RM1.01 billion for 1QFY19, while operating profit slumped 64.2% to RM32 million from RM89.4 million.
“For retail operations in Singapore, revenue and operating profit decreased by 36.6% and 55.2% respectively, mainly due to a lower number of cars sold in line with a reduction in the COE (certificate of entitlement) quota and dampened consumer sentiment caused by disruption to business activities caused by the outbreak of Covid-19.
“For retail operations in Malaysia, revenue decreased by 47.6%, attributed to a 51% drop in the number of new Honda cars sold, [which was] caused by a delay in the launching of various new models pending price approvals of the authorities, and the implementation of the movement control order (MCO) on March 18, which dampened economic activity and consumer sentiment with the suspension of operations of non-essential service providers and manufacturing activities,” it added.
Beyond the MCO period, the group said, reduced social and recreational activities until the pandemic is fully controlled globally and domestically will continue to dampen consumption and investment activities.
“Private consumption is expected to be affected by weak labour market conditions, mobility restrictions and subdued sentiment.
“The board is mindful of the seismic shifts that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought about to the domestic and global economies. The board will navigate the challenges ahead and formulate plans to strengthen further the group’s solid foundation for sustainable growth,” it added.
Oriental shares closed the day unchanged at RM5.79 on a thin volume of 89,200 shares. Its market capitalisation stood at RM3.59 billion.
