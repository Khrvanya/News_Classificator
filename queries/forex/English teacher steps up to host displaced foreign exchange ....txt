MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- A foreign exchange  student in South Milwaukee has found a much-needed home.
Pearl came from Taiwan  in August and began at South Milwaukee High School as a sophomore.
Last month, her host  family had an emergency. They could no longer have her.
"It felt really  bad, because I have to adjust to another family again, and I [didn't] know  what's going to happen," Pearl said.
Kerry Jude with  Greenheart Exchange worked to find Pearl a new host, ideally in South Milwaukee  so she wouldn't have to change schools.
Pearl's English teacher,  Jill Bobber, learned of Pearl's situation and decided to open her family's  doors.
"I've had a lot of  foreign exchange students in my classes before, but never one that I've  connected with on this type of level," Bobber said. "Pearl's a  great person. She has a great heart and a wonderful ability to connect with  people."
Pearl moved in just  before Christmas.
There have already been  family outings to the Milwaukee Public Museum with Pearl and Bobber's children.
"Pearl was able to  talk a little about her culture and her experiences and my oldest said 'Yup,  [Taiwan] is where I want to go, Mom. Sign me up,'" Bobber said.
They share stories, bits  of language and culture, including recipes.
"This Christmas is  my first Christmas because I don't celebrate Christmas at home and I tried many  foods from different countries," Pearl said.
Pearl will go back to  Taiwan at the end of the school year.
She says she misses her  family there, but they talk often, and they've been supportive of her decision  to come here.
