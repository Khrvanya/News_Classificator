A Council Bluffs man is charged with three federal counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and one count of possessing child pornography.
Thomas Boatright, 50, was arrested Monday, according to court records. Boatright served as a coordinator for EF High School Exchange Year, a program that connects international students with host families across the United States.
Federal prosecutors said that between July 27 and Feb. 13, Boatright made three children engage in sexual acts while he produced child pornography, according to an indictment.
A federal judge in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa ruled Monday that Boatright must remain in custody because he poses a severe risk to society, according to court records.
Omaha NBC-affiliate WOWT reported Boatright connected students with high school families and previously hosted teens in the program. EF High School Exchange Year is a division of Switzerland-based education services firm EF Education First.
The company told WOWT that students were immediately removed from Boatright's home and placed with temporary caregivers.
"This individual has been permanently removed from our program and will not be eligible to host students in the future," the company told WOWT. "We will continue working with law enforcement and will cooperate fully as they continue their investigation."
