The British pound rose slightly against the USD ahead of the important services and construction PMI data. The numbers are expected to show that services PMI declined to 12.2 in April while construction PMI improved to 44.0 from the previous 39.3. In total, the composite PMI is expected to decline from the previous 36.0 to a record low of 12.9. The services PMI is particularly important for the UK because it represents more than 80% of the GDP. Also, the sector employs millions of people, including those in the hospitality and financial sectors.
The US dollar index eased slightly in overnight trading as the market waited for the non-manufacturing PMI data. Analysts polled by Bloomberg expect the PMI to drop from the previous 52.9 to 36.8, which will be the lowest level on record. The non-manufacturing PMI will come a few days after ISM released the manufacturing PMI, which showed that the sector contracted sharply in April. The ISM will also release the non-manufacturing business activity, prices, and employment. Meanwhile, the commerce department will release the trade numbers for April. While April numbers are expected to be weak, analysts are looking ahead and focusing on the ongoing gradual reopening of the economy.
