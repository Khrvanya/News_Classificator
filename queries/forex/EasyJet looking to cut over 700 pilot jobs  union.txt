LONDON (Reuters) - British low cost airline easyJet (L: EZJ ) has said that 727 of its UK-based pilots are at risk of redundancy, equivalent to about one-third of its pilots in the country, union BALPA said in a statement.
The airline is proposing to close bases at London's Stansted and Southend airports and at Newcastle in north east England, BALPA said, adding that it was shocked by the scale of the job cuts.
EasyJet said in May it needed to cut 4,500 jobs to stay competitive after the coronavirus pandemic caused a travel market slump.
