Global System-in-Package Die Technologies Market: Snapshot
The escalating popularity of miniaturization in the electronic industry is augmenting the demand in the global system-in-package (SiP) die technologies market. SiP enables the arrangement of several active electronic components in a single unit to function together and provide multiple opportunities to develop advanced and yet cheaper electronic products. The need to control rising costs, rise in the number of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs), emergence of advanced and compact consumer electronic devices, design complexities in system-on-chip (SoC), and escalating number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are some of the key factors that are expected to significantly increment the demand in the global system-in-package die technologies market.
In the recent past, the field of electronics devices has seen multi-fold change, wherein feature phones are quickly replacing smartphones as well as laptops and tablets are replacing personal computers. In addition to that, the growing popularity of the smart homes concept, wherein electronic devices can be controlled and monitored with the help of mobile applications, will add to the prosperity of the SiP technologies market in the near future.
On the other hand, high inventory levels in supply chain and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates are two of the primary factors that are expected to challenge the SiP technology market from attaining its full potential in the near future. Additionally, heavy investment required to enter this market is restricting several prospect vendors, which would eventually improve the technology and reduced cost for the end users. The growth of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) vendors, emergence of fan-out wafer level packaging platform (FOWLP), and increasing need for automation in the flourishing automotive industry are a few latest trends in the global SiP die technologies market.
Global System-in-Package (SiP) Die Technologies Market: Overview
The global system-in-package (SiP) die technologies market holds out tremendous promise in the near future. SiP is a packaging technique that entails mounting a number of electronic sub components on to a single substrate along with other passive components. The unique perceived benefit of SiP is that it is not simply an IC package with multiple dies; but also contains fully functional systems or subsystems in the IC package.
