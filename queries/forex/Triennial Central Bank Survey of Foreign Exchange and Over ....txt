Senior Economist Vladyslav Sushko discusses the main findings of the 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey.
The Triennial Survey complements more frequent regional surveys conducted by foreign exchange committees in Australia , Canada , London , New York , Singapore and Tokyo as well as the semiannual survey of OTC derivatives markets coordinated by the BIS.
National survey results are also available on the websites of the central banks and other authorities that participated in the survey.
