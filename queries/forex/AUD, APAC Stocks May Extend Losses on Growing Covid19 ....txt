Wall Street ended on a downbeat note on Friday’s close with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices closing 2.84, 2.42 and 2.59 percent lower, respectively. Hard and soft commodities along with cycle-sensitive currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars suffered while the anti-risk Japanese Yen and US Dollar rose on market-wide risk aversion.
Treasuries across a range of maturities also gained along with spreads of credit default swaps (CDS) on investment-grade corporate debt. The source of risk aversion came from concern of the rising number of Covid-19 cases and what that could mean for future growth prospects that are already foreboding. Growing EU-US geopolitical tensions did not help lighten the mood.
The cycle-sensitive Australian and New Zealand Dollars may suffer with US equity futures and Asia-Pacific stock markets as part of a broader risk-off tilt echoing from last week’s close. A relatively sparse data docket leaves traders more focused macro-fundamental themes like Covid-19 and the alarming medical metrics pertaining to the virus’ spread. Regional credit markets may be rattled and may amplify JPY and USD ’s gains.
Ater failing to clear 0.7019 and 0.6911, bearish momentum in AUD/USD may be gaining traction after stalling at those levels signalled a lack of confidence in the pair’s upside potential – at least in the short term. As noted in prior pieces, AUD/USD may challenge a familiar inflection point at 0.6642, which if cleared could give way to further losses if it inspires additional sellers to enter the market.
