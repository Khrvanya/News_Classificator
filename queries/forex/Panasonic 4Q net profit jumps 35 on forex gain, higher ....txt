KUALA LUMPUR (June 29): Panasonic Manufacturing Malaysia Bhd’s net profit surged 34.92% to RM30.3 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2020 (4QFY19), from RM22.46 million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 50 sen from 37 sen.
The group said earnings were boosted by a forex gain of RM8.4 million, and a higher share of associate results totalling RM4 million as against RM1.2 million previously.
“A higher profit was achieved by the associate company, mainly due to lower promotional and marketing expenses incurred during the quarter under review,” the group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
Panasonic’s quarterly revenue slipped 9.3% to RM204.65 million from RM225.64 million a year earlier, as the government’s Movement Control Order (MCO) implemented on March 18 forced the group’s plant into a complete shutdown.
This, in turn, resulted in the group’s sales revenue dropping RM42.4 million, comprising mainly export sales to the Middle East market, the group said.
Panasonic has proposed a final dividend of 183 sen per share to be paid on Sept 25, raising the total dividend payout for FY19 to 198 sen.
For FY19 as a whole, the group said its net profit grew 10.63% to RM117 million from RM105.75 million in FY18, while revenue dropped 6.73% to RM1.1 billion from RM1.13 billion.
The group attributed the higher profitability to lower cost of materials and higher forex gain. This, it said, was recorded despite slightly sluggish domestic sales throughout FY19.
“The revenue for the financial year under review was further impacted by the drop in revenue attributed to the sudden announcement of the MCO in mid-March 2020,” it added,
Panasonic said the global economy is expected to experience a further slowdown in the second quarter of this year, due to the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus that resulted in the introduction of lockdown and social distancing measures in many major economies.
In the regional economies, the introduction of aggressive containment measures had affected both domestic supply and demand conditions, as well as disrupting supply chain, the group said.
“The domestic demand is expected to grow weaker with the mobility restrictions and closure of non-essential services imposed during the MCO, although the MCO has gradually been eased to a recovery phase now. Nevertheless, the company will strive to remain strong and resilient during these challenging times,” it added.
Panasonic shares settled 28 sen or 0.97% lower at RM28.68 today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM1.74 billion.
