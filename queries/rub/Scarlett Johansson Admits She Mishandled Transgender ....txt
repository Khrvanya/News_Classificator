“In hindsight, I mishandled that situation. I was not sensitive, my initial reaction to it,” Johansson said. “I wasn’t totally aware of how the trans community felt about those three actors playing — and how they felt in general about cis actors playing — transgender people. I wasn’t aware of that conversation — I was uneducated.”
Johansson continued, “I learned a lot through that process. I misjudged that. It was a hard time. It was like a whirlwind. I felt terribly about it. To feel like you’re kind of tone-deaf to something is not a good feeling.”
Johansson’s original statement was released July 3, 2018 and she officially exited “Rub & Tug” on July 12. Johansson marked her exit from the project by telling Out Magazine, “Our cultural understanding of transgender people continues to advance, and I’ve learned a lot from the community since making my first statement about my casting and realize it was insensitive. I have great admiration and love for the trans community and am grateful that the conversation regarding inclusivity in Hollywood continues.”
The “Rub & Tug” controversy followed a similar casting backlash involving Johansson’s role as the lead of Sanders’ “Ghost in the Shell.” Head over to Vanity Fair to read more of Johansson’s new interview.
