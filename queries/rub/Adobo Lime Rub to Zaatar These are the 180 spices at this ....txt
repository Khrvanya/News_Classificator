Zest, the Lititz kitchen supply store, is now a little spicier with an expanded its spice inventory.
The new spice shop is next door to the Lititz kitchen supply store at 30 E. Main Street. Opened Oct. 2 with 180 spices, says co-owner Sharon Landis. She plans to expand to 250 spices by the end of October.
Many of the spices are $4-$6, with most packaged in jars that hold a half-cup. A few are more expensive, like the ground lime leaf ($12.95) or Carolina Reaper garlic pepper ($11.95). The store has tasters to try samples.
These are the spices there now:
