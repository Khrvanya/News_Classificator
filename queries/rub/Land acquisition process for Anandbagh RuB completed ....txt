Hyderabad: The land acquisition process for Road under Bridge (RuB) in Anandbagh, Malkajgiri has been completed and the RuB is likely to be ready by July, said Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar on Wednesday.
The project, which is expected to ease traffic flow from Nacharam, Moula Ali and ECIL towards Secunderabad via Malkajgiri and back, has been pending since 2013. “The project was halted mainly due to delay in land acquisition of eight properties and now the properties have been acquired,” said a GHMC engineer.
According to the Roads and Buildings Department, Rangareddy, which is executing the works, concrete roads will be laid and box drains will be contructed after the retaining walls are built. “The Road under Bridge is the need of the hour, especially during downpour, as waterlogged roads make it difficult to commute for many,” said Prashant Mudiraj, a resident of Anandbagh.
The RuB is being constructed at a cost of Rs 27 crore and 19 properties have been acquired for the project.
The GHMC informed that it also plans to acquire five properties to lay service roads.
“We are in talks with property owners and have approached the court too. Even if the service roads are not laid, the RuB would be made operational,” said a GHMC official.
The RuB was to be made operational by April this year, however, due to several delays, the deadline was extended to July.
