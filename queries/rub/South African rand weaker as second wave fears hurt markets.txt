JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand opened weaker on Monday as investors sold riskier currencies on fears of a second wave of the coronavirus in Beijing.
At 0652 GMT, the rand traded at 17.31 versus the dollar, around 1.5% lower than its close on Friday.
Some investors use the rand as a proxy for emerging market risk, so it tends to swing considerably at times of global market volatility.
On the forex markets on Monday, the Chinese yuan and emerging market units including the Russian rouble dropped after Beijing recorded dozens of new cases of the novel coronavirus in recent days, all linked to a major wholesale food market.
South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose over 70,000 on the weekend, the most in Africa. It has recorded 1,480 deaths.
