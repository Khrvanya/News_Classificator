We found a plethora of crowd-pleasing plates, handy tips and tricks and have more than a few recipes earmarked ready for when we’re all allowed to entertain again. In the meantime, we’ll happily spend the rest of the summer – and beyond – working our way through the rest of these absolutely smoking books.

‘Fire Food: The Ultimate BBQ Cookbook’, by DJ BBQ, published by Quadrille
If you only buy one barbecue cookbook, make it this one – unless you’re a vegetarian. Youtube star and barbecue fanatic "DJ BBQ", aka Christian Slater, has been grilling up a storm since the tender age of six and explains in plain terms how to get cooking. The book spells out how to cook over flames using a thorough, scientific approach to fuelling and cooking with charcoal and wood – he is extremely disparaging of gas, be warned – and backs it up with clear illustrative photography that should have your grill hot to trot in as little as six minutes.
The recipes focus on meat, though that is not to say there aren’t a good number of veggie-friendly or veg-focused dishes. A lot of them use large joints – think Japanese pork belly, the most insanely delicious pulled pork recipe honed to perfection after all that festival cooking, and a sumptuous lamb shoulder. A stand-out dish is his Alabama white sauce chicken, which was recommended several times over, and we’ll be making his super-simple "dirty onions" (literally a whole unpeeled onion placed in the coals) forevermore. He does refined dishes pretty well too: scallops with pineapple and chorizo are delicate yet meaty and his Portuguese inspired beer clams are a bowl of briney, beery pleasure. Tremendous.
