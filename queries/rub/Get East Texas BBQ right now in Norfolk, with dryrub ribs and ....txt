Note: The Friday event has been canceled because of coronavirus concerns.
Thursday only, from noon to sold out, there is East Texas BBQ to be had in Norfolk.
Texas native “Cowboy” Dan Pringle, who works as support staff for the Navy SEALs, is cooking up some seriously excellent and meaty seasoned ribs, alongside pulled pork, smoked turkey legs, beef links and sliced or chopped brisket at St. Paul Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in Norfolk, at 310 E. Virginia Beach Blvd.
The March Meat Madness pop-up is cash only, dollars in the donation bin. Pringle, who is starting a catering business under the name of Texas Boy BBQ and Catering, is running this cookout as a benefit for the church.
In true Texas fashion, Pringle says he doesn’t think barbecue should require sauce. But try it anyway.
The deep-brown, tangy, spicy, only slightly sweet Beaumont-style sauce is a specialty of Patillo’s Barbecue a bit east of Houston — a 1912-founded, black-owned East Texas barbecue joint that is likely the oldest family-owned barbecue spot in that state.
Patillo’s is known for its beef links, and you’ll find some from Pringle as well — although he sourced those beef links in Hampton Roads, rather than order them from Texas.
