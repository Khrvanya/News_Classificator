Tuscan Prime sleeps with the fishes. The Italian steakhouse on Las Olas Boulevard announced its immediate closing in a Thursday Facebook post, capping a 9-month run.
“We appreciate your patronage and our entire team is grateful for the support you have shown,” the Facebook post says. “Look for something new and exciting, coming Summer 2020.”
Tuscan Prime opened in May 2019 , part of an onslaught of new Italian restaurants that arrived last year on Fort Lauderdale’s premier shopping and dining corridor. The unending appetite for Italian cuisine has apparently reached its limit, although 12 Italian restaurants and pizzerias remain on the one-mile stretch.
“Sorry to hear but fingers crossed for the new venture,” Carl Berkelhammer wrote on Tuscan Prime’s Facebook page.
Tuscan Prime served a selection of prime steaks and pastas in an elegant and expansive two-floor dining room at 401 E. Las Olas Blvd. Tuscan Prime was the first foray into South Florida for restaurateurs Gennaro and Michele DiMeo, whose Monte Restaurant Development Group runs 12 restaurants, most in the Virginia/Maryland/Washington D.C. area.
