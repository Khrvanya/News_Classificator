The Russian National Convention Bureau Director has joined the Union of Exhibitions and Tradefairs (RUEF) President in signing a Memorandum directed to the Russian government urging support for the congress and exhibition business during the Covid-19 crisis. The Memorandum underlines the sector’s crucial importance for the Russian economy.
The Memorandum pledges the industry’s support for government measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus, while noting the mounting losses to the sector. The signatories say cancellations are likely to lead to bankruptcies and the potential loss of 140,000 jobs in the sector.
The hit to the economy could, RUEF believes, be in the region of 50 billion roubles (US$6.7bn) with a domino effect taking place.
The RUEF reminds the Russian government in its Memorandum that the events industry in Russia contributes approximately 3% of the country’s GDP.
The Memorandum was signed by the President of Russia’s National Chamber of Commerce, S. Katyrin; President of the RUEF, S. Voronkov; Director of the National Convention Bureau, A. Kalachev , and other heads of leading industry associations.
The Government of Moscow has introduced a ban on all public events larger than 50 people until 10 April.
