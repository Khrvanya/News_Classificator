By the time the 49ers season is over, Arik Armstead's jersey could end up threadbare from all the belly rubbing.
Every time the defensive lineman registers a sack, he strokes his stomach in hungry-man fashion to underscore how much he likes feasting on opposing quarterbacks. And he's never had a bigger appetite than this season.
On Sunday, he planted Carolina's Kyle Allen for his fifth and a half sack of the year, giving him the team lead over rookie phenom Nick Bosa, who's something of a sack machine himself.
Now even fans are getting into the action.
While Armstead was polishing his solar plexus after dropping Allen, a fan wearing a Ronnie Lott jersey in the first row of the Levi's stands was caught on video imitating the gesture to an almost mirror-like perfection. Armstead was so impressed, he asked the Twitterverse to help him find the fan so he could give him a shirt.

He didn't have to wait long.
"It's me!" tweeted Rick (@lockricksmith) whose Twitter profile lists him as a husband, father, locksmith and coach in Merced. Rick included a photo from the game as proof.
Fellow fans responded with heartfelt wishes and congratulatory memes.
