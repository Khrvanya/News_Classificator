U.S. stocks are firmly lower early Wednesday, pressured at least partly amid renewed virus concerns.
Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has extended a bearish reversal from record highs — to punctuate a bearish gravestone doji — while the S&P 500 has plunged from its latest failed test of familiar resistance (3,155).  Elsewhere, the Dow industrials are also firmly lower, pressured to punctuate a failed test of the 200-day moving average.
