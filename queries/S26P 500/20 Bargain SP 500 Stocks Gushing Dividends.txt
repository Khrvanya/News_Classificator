Data as of October 14, 2019.
While more than 80% of S&P 500 member companies pay a dividend, just 187 pay out at least 40% of their earnings as dividends. Since a high payout ratio can signal an inability to grow or maintain the dividend, we required the passing stocks to meet two additional criteria. First, the indicated dividend must be above the dividend paid for the most recently completed fiscal year. Secondly, the I/B/E/S consensus earnings estimate must signal earnings growth for the current fiscal year. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were also excluded since they pay distributions instead of qualified dividends.
Finally, a price-earnings ratio below the average for the last five years was required to identify those stocks that may be undervalued on a relative basis.
