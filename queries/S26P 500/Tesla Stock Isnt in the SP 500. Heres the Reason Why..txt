Tesla Stock Isn’t in the S&P 500. Here’s the Reason Why.
Tesla stands a good chance of joining the S&P 500 by the end of 2020 or early 2021.
Tesla has shaken up the global auto industry and recently passed $100 billion in market value , but the electric-car company is not in the S&P 500 index.
With a market capitalization of $103 billion, Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is by far the most valuable U.S. company that’s not in the index.
It stands a good chance of inclusion by the end of 2020 or early 2021 because of projected profitability during 2020. Tesla stock, which has been on a tear recently , could get an added boost if it’s added to the S&P 500 because of buying from index funds that own an estimated 20%-plus of the index.
Tesla stock is 0.91% lower to $567.97 Friday. They have risen 37% so far in 2020 and have more than doubled since late October.
One of the inclusion criteria for the S&P 500 is cumulative profits based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) over four quarters. Tesla hasn’t met that test yet. The company was profitable in the third quarter of 2019 with earnings per share of 80 cents after losses in the first two quarters of 2019 .
Tesla is expected to post fourth-quarter EPS of 71 cents when it releases financial results on Jan. 29. Analysts expect the company to generate a narrow loss in the current quarter of 19 cents a share, followed by profits in the second and third quarter, Bloomberg data show.
After Tesla, the next largest U.S. company that’s not in the S&P 500 is Uber Technologies (UBER) with a market value of $63 billion. Uber’s entry into the index could be several years away given its steep losses.
The company is aiming to reach profitability in 2021 based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda). It may take some time after 2021—even assuming Uber hits that financial target—for the company to become profitable on a more-conservative GAAP basis.
An S&P spokesman said the company doesn’t comment on potential inclusion of individual companies in its indices.
