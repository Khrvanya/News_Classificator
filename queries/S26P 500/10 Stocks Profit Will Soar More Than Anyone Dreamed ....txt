Most S&P 500 companies are expected to make less than thought in 2020, not more. Analysts have slashed what they think 10 of the 11 S&P 500 sectors will earn this year, says FactSet. And some of the cuts are dramatic.
Going into the year, analysts thought S&P 500 industrial companies would post 14.9% earnings growth in 2020. But hammered by fears of the coronavirus on manufacturing, analysts cut their profit growth forecast to 8%.
It's a similar story with S&P 500 materials. Analysts think the sector will post just 6% profit growth in 2020, down from the 13.2% they expected going into the year.
What's the only S&P 500 sector analysts think will do better than they thought? Information technology . The sector is now seen growing profit by 10.4%, up from just 9% earlier in the year.
Four of the 10 S&P 500 companies with the largest upgrades in expected 2020 EPS growth are in technology. Many also carry high IBD Composite Ratings , too. That reflects their bullish price movements and solid fundamentals.
Take computer chipmaking equipment company Applied Materials. Coming into the year, analysts thought the company would make $3.83 a share in 2020. But following the company's 5% better-than-expected fourth quarter results, analysts upped their 2020 profit estimate by 12% to $4.30 a share (for the calendar year). If analysts are right, that would mean Applied Materials' 2020 earnings would rise 34% from 2019.
No wonder the stock is up 64% in 12 months and 9.4% just this year. And it carries a Composite Rating of 98 .
Lam Research is another company benefiting from rising semiconductor demand . Like Applied, the company also sells gear used in the manufacture of chips.
Going into 2020, analysts thought Lam would earn $16.99 a share in the calendar year. But following its earnings report, analysts scrambled to bump up their 2020 profit forecast by 12% to $19.08. Now, profit is seen jumping 32% this year. Again, the stock is up 87% in 12 months and 16% just this year.
Certainly, forecasts are just guesses. But it's still interesting for investors to keep tabs on the companies where the numbers are looking brighter.
