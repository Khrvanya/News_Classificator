The Effect Of Mandatory Mask Policies And Politics On Economic Recovery: A State By State View
The S&P 500 set its all-time intraday high of 3,393.52 on February 19 and declined by a bear market 35.4% to its March 23 low of 2,191.86. This was followed by a bull market rebound of 47.5% to a high of 3,233.13 set on June 8.
The index gapped lower on February 24, moving below its 50-day simple moving average (in blue on the chart) and its semiannual pivot at 3,303.4. The S&P then fell below its 200-day simple moving average (in green) on March 5. This led to the March 23 low.
On the rebound, the S&P 500 reached its 50-day SMA on April 17, then crossed above its quarterly pivot at 2,979.6 on May 26. The S&P has been above its monthly pivot at 3,062.1 since June 2. The gap higher on June 5 began the island reversal. The gap lower on June 11 confirmed the island reversal, which is considered a technical sell signal. Note that the S&P is above its 200-day SMA at 3,013.4.
The Weekly Chart for the S&P 500:
The weekly chart for S&P 500 is positive but overbought. The index is above its five-week modified moving average at 2,981.9 and well above its 200-week simple moving average or reversion to the mean at 2,685.8.
The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to rise to 80.61 this week, up from 74.21 on June 5.
If the close on Friday, June 12 is below 3,031.5 it would be a weekly key reversal, which is another sell signal.
