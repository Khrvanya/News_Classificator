The S&P 500 has companies like Apple, Amazon & Microsoft
Iconic American motorcycle brand Harley-Davidson has been removed from the Dow Jones S&P 500 list, a key benchmark for US stocks. The S&P 500 us considered as a measure of how the American economy is doing and includes 500 large companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase which are listed on US stock exchanges. These companies are worth billions of dollars and are considered to be representative of the US economy. And now, Harley-Davidson will no longer be part of the S&P 500 Index, instead, it will be listed in the S&P Midcap 400, a listing of smaller companies.
