The forces that propelled Aramco's growth from a single well to the biggest oil producer in the world are changing underfoot. Now that the company has sold shares, can it sustain the kind of growth needed to keep investors happy? WSJ explains.
The S&P 500 energy sector entered a bear market Friday, registering its worst January on record as oil prices dropped on concerns about global growth.
The group has fallen 11% this month, by far the weakest performance of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, which is down 0.2% for the year after a selloff Friday.
