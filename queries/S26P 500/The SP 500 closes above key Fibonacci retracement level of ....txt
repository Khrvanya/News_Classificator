The S&P 500 surged 3.2% to 2,953.91 on Monday to the highest close since March 6, which was before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. More importantly for many chart watchers, the index has now retraced 62.4% of the coronavirus-related selloff from the Feb. 19 record close of 2,386.15 and the 3 1/2-year low of 2,237.40 on March 23; the 61.8% retracement was at 2,947.33. Followers of the Fibonacci ratio of 1.618, also known as the "golden ratio," suggest that retracements that surpass 61.8% are no longer governed by the previous trend, and that a full retracement is the next target. The S&P 500 is the second of the Big 3 stock market indexes to surpass the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. The Nasdaq Composite COMP,
has retraced 80.3% of its coronavirus selloff (it passed 61.8% target on April 27), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retraced 54.8% of its selloff (61.8% of the selloff would be at 25,364.89). To put the S&P 500's rally in context, there were under 500 COVID-19 cases diagnosed and 19 deaths in the U.S. on March 6, compared with the current count of about 1.5 million cases and just under 90,000 deaths.
