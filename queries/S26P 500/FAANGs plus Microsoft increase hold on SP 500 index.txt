The FAANGs and Microsoft made up more than a fifth of the market cap of the S&P 500 index as of Tuesday. That hold, about 22%, increased from 18% at the end of the fourth quarter and 17% as of Sept. 30. Netflix and Amazon.com have led the group as the services of the two online giants have been even higher demand than before stay-at-home mandates were passed.
With Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all boasting $1 trillion-plus market caps, the performance of the index is more dependent on the success and failure of a smaller-than-ever number of holdings. Their combined market cap compared to the total size of the cap-weighted index rose 1.7 percentage points over the first four months of the year.
Netflix stock is up about 34% on the year; its streaming traffic has spiked as users remain homebound. Amazon shares are 27% higher in 2020 with shoppers avoiding brick-and-mortar stores due to COVID-19. The online retailer's 2017 acquisition of grocer Whole Foods has also helped drive revenues as the demand for grocery-delivery services has exploded. Returns in 2020 for Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook haven't been as robust as there contemporaries; the two have outperformed the S&P 500 by 12.4% and 13%, respectively.
