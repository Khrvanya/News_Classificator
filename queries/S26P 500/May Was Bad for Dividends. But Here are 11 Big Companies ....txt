May Was Bad for Dividends. But Here are 11 Big Companies That Raised Their Payouts.
Although many S&P 500 companies suspended or cut their dividends in May as a result of the pandemic, 11 companies have raised their payouts during that month.
They include medical device maker Medtronic (ticker: MDT), PepsiCo (PEP), and Clorox (CLX). These companies and three others— Cardinal Health (CAH), Chubb (CB), and Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD)—are members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.
Those companies have paid out higher dividends every year for at least 25 consecutive years. The group has 66 members.
These dividend increases were put through during a month when many companies said they would maintain their payouts at current levels or, worse, suspend them. In all , 18 S&P 500 companies announced suspensions and five others said they were cutting their dividends.
On the positive side of the dividend ledger, some large companies did manage to declare dividend increases in May.
Medtronic, which yields 2.4%, announced that it would raise its quarterly dividend to 58 cents a share, up 7% from 54 cents.
PepsiCo, plans to pay a quarterly dividend of $1.0225 cents a share, up 7% from 95.5 cents. The stock yields 3.1%.
Clorox declared a quarterly disbursement of $1.11 a share, up nearly 5% from $1.06. The stock yields 2.2%.
Drug distributor Cardinal Health has declared a quarterly payout of 48.59 cents a share, up 1%. The stock yields 3.6%.
Another dividend increase was announced by property and casualty insurer Chubb, which yields 2.6%. The company plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 78 cents a share, up 4% from 75 cents. That equates to an annual dividend of $3.12 a share.
Expeditors International of Washington declared a semiannual disbursement of 52 cents a share. That’s an increase of 2 cents, or 4%, from 50 cents. The stock of the shipping and logistics company yields 1.4%.
Ameriprise Financial (AMP), which offers financial planning, asset management and insurance, declared a quarterly dividend of $1.07 a share, up from 97 cents, for a 7% increase. The company was spun off from American Express (AXP) in 2005. The stock yields 3%.
Baxter International (BAX), which makes various medical-supplies and technology including infusion systems, is planning to raise its quarterly dividend to 24.5 cents a share, versus 22 cents currently. That’s an 11% boost.
Aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.45 a share, up from $1.32, for a 10% increase. The stock yields 1.7%.
TE Connectivity (TEL), whose products include electronic components, recently declared a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share, up from 46 cents, for a 4% increase.
S&P Dow Jones Indices included Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) on its list of dividend increases for S&P 500 companies in May, although the company didn’t declare an increase during the month.
Yet the company’s declared second-quarter dividend of 36 cents a share is 5 cents higher than it was a year earlier. The stock yields 1.4%.
