The Dow and S&P 500 just logged the worst start to a quarter in history as investors brace for ‘very, very painful’ weeks of coronavirus
Bearishness to start the second quarter on Wall St.
The stock market on Wednesday started the second quarter nearly the same way it ended March, with bruising losses.
A resumption of declines to commence the first trading day in April, or the second quarter, for already-battered equity gauges, resulted in the worst start to a quarter for stock-market bulls ever.
For the broad-market S&P 500 index, its decline of 4.44% represents the index’s worst first day of any quarter on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index was created in 1957, to put things into perspective.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, logged its worst start to the first three months in a calendar year in its 124-year history, managing to exceed a 4.32% decline put in to start the third quarter of 1896.
tumbled 114 points, or 4.41%, to 2,470.50, while The Nasdaq Composite COMP,
closed 340 points, or 4.41%, lower to 7,360.
Stocks also ended lower on Tuesday, capping a quarter that saw stocks tumble from February records into a bear market at record speed.
The first quarter marked the worst quarterly performance for the Dow since the fourth quarter of 1987, and the three-month skid also represented the steepest first-quarter drop, from January through the end of March, in the index’s history, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Wednesday’s action comes as U.S. investors are coming to grips with the prospect of a long haul for the economy and the markets amid a pandemic that has been contracted by more than 900,000 people world-wide. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump warned that a “very, very painful” two weeks lie ahead for the country in face of a rapidly spreading COVID-19 epidemic, which originated in December in Wuhan, China and has brought much of the world to a screeching halt to slow the spread of the deadly pathogen.
The Dow now stands 29.13% from its record close on Feb. 12, while the S&P 500 is off 27% and the Nasdaq is off 25% from their Feb. 19 all-time closing highs.
