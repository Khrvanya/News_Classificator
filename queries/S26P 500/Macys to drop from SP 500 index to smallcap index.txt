A shuttered Macy's store and empty parking lot are seen at the closed Palisades Center shopping mall during the coronavirus outbreak in West Nyack, New York, U.S., March 20, 2020.
NEW YORK: Macy's Inc will be removed from the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, the S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Tuesday, as coronavirus-induced store closures compound the retail sector's struggles with a shift to online shopping.
The company's shares have plunged more than 70% so far this year, leaving Macy's with a market value of $1.52 billion as of Tuesday's close, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
"Macy's has a market capitalization more representative of the small-cap market space," S&P said, adding that the company would become part of the S&P small-cap 600 index, effective April 6.
The pandemic has forced U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers, including Macy's Inc and Gap Inc , to shut stores, furlough employees, withdraw forecasts and suspend dividends.
That deal is expected to close on April 3.
Raytheon will be replaced in the S&P 500 by United Technologies' elevator unit Otis Worldwide Corp , according to a statement from the S&P Dow Jones Indices. - Reuters
