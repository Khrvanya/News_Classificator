Coronavirus cases in the US reached a record daily high as concerns mount over a potential second wave in a number of states across the US. This has been most evident in Florida and Texas, in which the latter has halted plans of further reopening and thus raises concerns over the trajectory of the economic recovery, particularly if an escalation prompts state-wide lockdowns. That said, this is not just a US-centric story as other countries have also seen a pick up in COVID cases, including Germany, Japan, and China. As such, market participants will continue to assess the rising number of virus cases, whereby a continued pick up can keep risk appetite pressured. Notable economic data points to watch include the US ISM Manufacturing PMI and Non-Farm Payrolls
