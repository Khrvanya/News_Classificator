The S&P 500 has made a major comeback.
After hitting the lows of the sell-off on March 23, the benchmark index has rocketed 21% higher.
A handful of its stocks have led the charge — MGM , Capri , Coty , Nvidia and Halliburton have all soared off their March lows.
"When you look at these names I think that it makes sense they're rolling off the lows. If you're a long-term investor, I think it makes sense to get into them here," Danielle Shay, director of options at Simpler Trading, told CNBC's " Trading Nation " on Tuesday.
Only one has the best chance of outperforming from a trading perspective, though, she adds.
"I love the relative strength that we've seen with Nvidia. The chipmakers are incredibly strong, and it has an upcoming earnings report, and I think it's going to continue trading higher into that report," said Shay.
Nvidia is set to report earnings on May 7. Analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate 90% earnings growth in its first quarter.
Todd Gordon , managing director of Ascent Wealth Partners, agrees with Shay, noting that Nvidia has both fundamental and technical tailwinds.
"It's a leader in AI, data centers, all sorts, self-driving cars, cloud, gaming. It's just unbelievable. From a technical point of view, [it's] another stock that here in the weekly is holding the 50- and 200-week moving average. So, really good relative strength," Gordon said during the same segment.
Gordon says the stock is now bumping up against a $300 target. On the daily chart, it is also holding above its 50- and 200-day moving average, he notes.
"There's a big open interest at the $300 call strike next month in the May options, so watch that should  this market stabilize," Gordon added.
Nvidia shares hit a low of $180.68 on March 18. Since then, they have risen 43%.
