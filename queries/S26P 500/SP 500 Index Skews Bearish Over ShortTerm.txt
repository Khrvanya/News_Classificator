Thursday’s snapback rally looked to be counter-trend in nature and should stop Friday and/or Monday and turn back lower.
We would need to see the S&P 500 rally more than 61.8% of the Tuesday to Thursday decline to lessen our bearish short-term conviction.
There is no real evidence of anything more than a minor bounce.
It’s thought that Wednesday’s negatives outweighed Thursday’s positives. A bit more rally is possible but look for selling to resume.
Leave this field empty if you're human:
Until this week’s highs are exceeded, it is right to look for lower prices.
