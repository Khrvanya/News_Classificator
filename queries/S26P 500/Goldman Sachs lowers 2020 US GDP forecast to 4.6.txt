Consumer spending is likely to stall in July and August due to state-imposed restrictions to combat the coronavirus, economists led by Jan Hatzius said, according to Economic Times.
â€œA combination of tighter state restrictions and voluntary social distancing is already having a noticeable impact on economic activity," the economists said in a report published on Saturday.
Economists at Goldman Sachs, however, expect the economy to regain poise in the third quarter and expand by 5.8% in 2021. In addition, the investment bank sees the jobless rate at 9% at the end of 2020 compared to the previous forecast of 9.5%.
