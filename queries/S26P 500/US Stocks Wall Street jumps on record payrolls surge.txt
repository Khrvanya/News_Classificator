Massive stimulus and hopes for a speedy economic rebound have returned the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to about 7% and 12% below their record highs reached in February.
The indexes are all on track for solid weekly percentage gains. The U.S. economy added 4.8 million jobs in June according to the Labor Department, 1.8 million more than analysts expected, setting a second consecutive record.
Massive rehiring sent the unemployment rate down to 11.1%. “A lot of these numbers when you dig into the report – average weekly hours people are working, average hourly earnings … those things are just showing that we are getting back to work,” said Justin Hoogendoorn, head of Fixed Income Strategic Analytics at Piper Sandler in Chicago. “And that’s what’s going to allow the stock market to continue to perform well.”
Even with May and June’s consecutive record payroll gains, the labor market has still recovered only a fraction of the 22 million jobs lost in the March-April plunge.
