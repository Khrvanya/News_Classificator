The S&P 500 fell 140.85 points, or 4.9%, to end at 2,741.38 — off 19.04% from its Feb. 19 record close. The Nasdaq dropped 392.20 points, or 4.7%, ending at 7,952.05 — down 19% from its all-time closing high, which was also set on Feb. 19.
Stocks saw another day of heavy selling Wednesday, on worries about the economic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic with its disruptions to travel and trade, along with the lack of action on fiscal stimulus by the Trump administration, and a renewed slump in oil prices amid a global price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that has hit U.S. energy companies and amplified corporate credit worries.
Stocks suffered their largest one-day plunge since 2008 on Monday, coinciding with the 11th anniversary of the start of the S&P 500’s longest bull market in history. Stocks dropped into correction mode — defined as a pullback of 10% — late last month as fears over the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak began to rise.
