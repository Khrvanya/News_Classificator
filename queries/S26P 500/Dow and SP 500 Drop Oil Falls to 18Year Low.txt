Stocks fell Wednesday as U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in March, underscoring the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, while slumping energy demand sent oil prices to an 18-year low.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 445.41 points, or 1.9%, to 23504.35, giving up much of its gains from the previous dayâ€™s rally. The S&P 500 dropped 62.70, or 2.2%, to 2783.36. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 122.56, or 1.4%, to close at 8393.18.
