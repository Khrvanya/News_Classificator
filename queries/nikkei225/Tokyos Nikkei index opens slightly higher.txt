Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei index opened slightly higher Wednesday following three days of rallies and after US shares retreated on warnings about lingering economic risks from the coronavirus.
The Nikkei 225 was up 0.27 per cent, or 54.65 points, at 20,488.10 in early trade, while the broader Topix index slipped 0.02 per cent, or 0.30 points, to 1,485.
Investors were "disheartened by falls in US shares and are profit-taking", Okasan Online Securities chief strategist Yoshihiro Ito said in a commentary.
US President Donald Trump's warning that Washington may leave the World Health Organization is also weighing on the market, he noted.
With more fatalities and cases in the United States than any other country by far, the under-pressure US president has blamed the WHO for not doing enough to combat the initial spread of coronavirus.
"They're a puppet of China, they're China-centric to put it nicer," he said earlier this week. "They gave us a lot of bad advice."
Trump had already suspended US funding to the UN body, and after his White House comments, he tweeted a letter he had sent to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus threatening to make that freeze permanent.
