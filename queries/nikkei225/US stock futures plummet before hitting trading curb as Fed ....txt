To be sure, volume in US futures trading is lighter than during normal hours, so price moves can be magnified on a percentage basis.
The Fed's stimulus efforts come at a time when many major experts are calling for an economic recession to hit the US in upcoming quarters. JPMorgan adjusted its forecast last week and now expects the US to see a full-fledged contraction by July. As forecasts worsen, investors are still waiting for the official passage of a coronavirus-driven economic stimulus bill.
"The Fed can't do all the work itself," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note on Sunday. "Congress has no choice but to pass the House bill, or something like it, and then immediately start work on a *much* bigger bill to push cash at small/medium-sized businesses, the self-employed, and households."
The sharp moves in futures contracts continues a volatile stretch for US equities. The Dow is fresh off a 1,985-point (9.4%) surge on Friday, much of which came amid President Donald Trump's national address, which saw him outline efforts to combat the coronavirus. But that came just one day after the Dow suffered a historic sell-off, plunging 10% - the most since Black Monday in 1987 .
