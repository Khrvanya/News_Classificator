On the 4-hour time frame, it can be seen that USDJPY has been consolidating with a slightly upward slope. Because this follows after a strong drop, a bearish flag chart pattern has formed between the 100 SMA and 200 SMA. This is considered as a bearish flag chart pattern. A close below the 100 SMA at 107.45 could be enough for a downside break. It could mean that USDJPY may soon fall to support at 105.22 where it bottomed on March 16.

The currency pair may soon rally to near-term resistance at 110.15 where it bottomed on March 24.
