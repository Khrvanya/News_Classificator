ASX 200 & Nikkei 225 Price Outlook: Stocks and Sentiment Steady, For Now
The Australian and Japanese equity markets have suffered alongside their developed, and indeed global, counterparts this month and were some of the first to feel the parasitic economic effects of the coronavirus. Now that the virus has become a global pandemic and governments have responded in addition to their central banks, it appears market panic has stalled – at least for the time being. In turn, global equity markets have moved off their lows after suffering a historic daily decline on Monday.
While sentiment has surely improved, it also remains undeniably vulnerable as the world grapples with an unprecedented economic headwind. Therefore, continued volatility is likely – as the VIX would suggest – and technical trading levels may still be tested. In the case of the ASX 200, the RBA has offered lower rates in an attempt to buoy its economy.
