The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong erased earlier losses of more than 1% to finish up 0.1% at 22,953.68.
Last Friday, the index lost more than 5% after China announced a new national security law , which, if implemented, would give Beijing more control over Hong Kong and may incite further pro-democracy protests in the city. The draft measure was announced as China's National People's Congress (NPC) — the country's parliament — kicked off its annual session and will last until May 28.
"Risk sentiment proved resilient, on Friday night, to concerns about the fallout from China introducing national security legislation in Hong Kong. Weakness in Asian equities gave way to a flattish European session, and mild positivity in the US," Hayden Dimes at ANZ Research said in a Monday morning note.
Government departments in Hong Kong rallied behind Beijing's plans on Monday after thousands took to the streets to protest over the weekend, Reuters reported . Security Chief John Lee said "terrorism" was growing in the city and activities that harm national security became more rampant, the news wire said.
Still, China's announcement drew criticism from U.S. officials. White House national security advisor Robert O'Brien said on Sunday that if Beijing goes ahead with implementing the controversial law, the U.S. government will likely impose sanctions on China .
