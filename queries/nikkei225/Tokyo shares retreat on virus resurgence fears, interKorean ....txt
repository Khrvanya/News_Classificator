TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo shares fell back Wednesday as an increase in the number of new coronavirus infections in China and the United States and a worsening in inter-Korean relations dented sentiment.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended down 126.45 points, or 0.56 percent, from Tuesday at 22,455.76. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 6.36 points, or 0.40 percent, lower at 1,587.09.
Decliners were led by air transportation, land transportation and textile and apparel issues.
In foreign exchange trading, the U.S. dollar was top heavy in the lower 107 yen zone after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell overnight expressed concerns about the U.S. economic outlook.
At 5 p.m., the U.S. unit fetched 107.34-36 yen, compared with 107.28-38 yen in New York and 107.32-33 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
The euro was quoted at $1.1265-1267 and 120.92-96 yen against $1.1257-1267 and 120.85-95 yen in New York and $1.1322-1324 and 121.51-55 yen in Tokyo late Tuesday afternoon.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond ended flat from the previous day's close at 0.015 percent after selling of the safe debts on expectations of a reported $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure scheme were offset by buying on virus resurgence fears.
Tokyo shares lost more than 1 percent at the outset despite an overnight rally on Wall Street as concerns were rekindled over another wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, brokers said.
"Although economic data across the globe indicate the worst is over, virus fears will continue to hamper the pace of market recovery until effective vaccines are widely available," said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co.
Security concerns in Northeast Asia also weighed on the market after North Korea's military authority announced Wednesday the redeployment of troops to two areas that had been demilitarized under agreements with the South, a day after Pyongyang blew up a joint liaison office in the border city of Kaesong, they said.
Trading slowed in the afternoon as some investors took to the sidelines following media reports that top diplomats from the United States and China will likely meet in Hawaii later in the day.
"Eyes are on whether there will be talks that could lead to an easing of their tensions" following their disputes regarding the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong and China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Ichikawa said.
On the First Section, declining issues outnumbered advancers 1,222 to 869, while 77 ended unchanged.
The stronger yen added to selling pressure on carmakers, with Mazda Motor falling 34 yen, or 4.3 percent, to 749 yen and Nissan declining 11.00 yen, or 2.5 percent, to 430.10 yen.
Toray Industries skidded 16.20 yen, or 3.0 percent, to 519.50 yen following a media report that the synthetic fiber maker has halted operation of its South Carolina plant and decided to cut some 25 percent of its U.S. workforce after the pandemic reduced demand for its airplane materials.
Bucking the trend, defense-related issues benefitted from the jitters over the Korean Peninsula. Ishikawa Seisakusho jumped 238 yen, or 14 percent, to 1,914 yen, Shigematsu Works surged 84 yen, or 7.7 percent, to 1,171 yen and Howa Machinery went up 43 yen, or 5.3 percent, to 855 yen.
Trading volume on the main section fell to 1,176.98 million shares from Tuesday's 1,554.76 million shares.
