Stocks have enjoyed a significant recovery this week as governments look to inject their respective economies with stimulus to assist workers and businesses alike. As a result, the Dow Jones , Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have pressed higher , so too has the DAX 30 . Not to be outdone, the Nikkei 225 has reclaimed several technical levels of note as it climbs alongside its sister indices. Consequently, bulls may look to continue the rebound rally but resistance looms overhead.
To that end, an early barrier to a continuation higher may reside around the Fibonacci level at 20,365 which has given rise to price indecision in the past. While the zone is unlikely to make or break a stock rally on its own, its influence over price should not be ignored as it may present an attractive opportunity to reduce or increase exposure â€“ depending on your directional bias.
