Tokyo's key Nikkei index opened modestly higher on Wednesday as a higher yen against the dollar and profit-taking offset support from rallies on Wall Street.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 0.26 percent or 59.21 points at 22,608.26 in early trade, while the broader Topix index edged down 0.09 percent or 1.36 points to 1,585.78.
"A higher yen against the dollar is weighing on the market, prompting investors to lock in profits," said Okasan Online Securities.

The dollar fetched 106.44 yen in early Asian trade, against 106.53 yen in New York on Tuesday.
On Wall Street, the tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.7 percent -- its second straight record -- while the Dow advanced 0.5 percent to 26,156.10.
