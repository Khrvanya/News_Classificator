Gold revenue increased modestly from $411 million in 2016 to $441 million in 2018.
However, with the company’s renewed and greater focus on its gold division, gold revenue is expected to witness a sharp increase, with the segment adding ~$175 million by 2020.
Shipments are expected to increase in the near term, following the acquisition of a new gold stream at Stillwater, and the New San Dimas agreement under which silver production that was attributable to the company under the old agreement would now be converted to the equivalent gold volume.
Price realization is set to improve with a rise in global gold prices following higher retail and institutional investment in the yellow metal in the face of rising economic uncertainty.
Segment revenues have seen a continuous decline due to lower production and fall in global silver prices.
The trend is likely to continue in the near term with WPM expected to lose over $42 million of its silver revenue by 2020, led by volume decline.
Silver price realization is expected to gradually increase from $15.81/ounce in 2018 to $16.75/ounce in 2020, due to an increase in prices of precious metals with an expected global economic slowdown.
Palladium is a new addition to WPM’s revenue streams since Q3 2018, with the segment adding $9.2 million in FY 2018.

Net Income increased from $195 million in 2016 to $427 million in 2018. The sharp rise in 2018 was driven by one-time tax benefits realized.
However, net income is expected to decrease to $238 million in 2019, on the back of higher base effect and large impairment charge recorded in Q2 2019, related to the recoverable amount under Voisey’s Bay PMPA (precious metals purchase agreement with Vale to acquire cobalt from the facility) being $166 million less than its carrying value.
This is expected to be followed by a recovery in net income to $315 million in 2020.
Net income margins are expected to fall from 53.8% in 2018 to 27% in 2019, with a rise to 33% in 2020.
EPS has grown from $0.44 in 2016 to $0.96 in 2018. We estimate it to be $0.54 and $0.71 in 2019 and 2020, respectively
Lower EPS in 2020 and 2021 can be attributed to lower net income and an almost stable share count.
