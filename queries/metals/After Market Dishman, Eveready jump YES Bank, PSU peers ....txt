“The market started the holiday-shortened week on a flat note. However, the consolidation extended on account of F&O expiry-led volatility and concerns over the government’s fiscal math due to a possible delay in the divestment planned for this financial year. Global markets seemed to be in comfort zone, fuelled by hopes of easing trade tension, while the domestic market is expected to wait for cues from the Budget," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.
