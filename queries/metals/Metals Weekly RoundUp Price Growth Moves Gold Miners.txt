The price of gold is up 11 percent year-to-date despite experiencing volatility in March and early April and has emerged as the safe have asset of choice amid economic uncertainty.
“Gold looks as if it might come just short of the all-time high of US$1,922 that it saw back in 2011. But we do think that … we’ve only seen a short, small part of what will continue to be a bull run,” said independent analyst Ross Norman , during his remote presentation for the World Gold Forum.
At 10:45 a.m. EDT, an ounce of gold was trading for US$1,724.53.

“We have the silver price hitting a high before the end of (the year) of US$19, but even at the same time, we still see the (gold/silver) ratio around the 90s at year end. But bear in mind of course, the market is very small, it doesn’t take much money coming in to have those more pronounced moves in silver,” Philip Newman, director of Metals Focus told the Investing News Network .
Silver was selling for US$15.18, as of 10:55 a.m. EDT.
Broken supply chains and a decline in auto manufacturing remains a headwind in the platinum space.

“The economic data we’ve had has just been horrendous, they just indicate that we’re facing a very deep contraction,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, told Reuters .
“If we’re going to have a deep contraction, then demand will be under pressure and that is keeping industrial metals markets from joining the exuberance we’ve seen in the stock market.”
