Wheaton grew earnings per share at a rate of just 2.4% over the last decade. We expect the company to earn 53 cents per share in 2019. If achieved, this would represent a 10% increase from 2018.
Several of Wheaton's mines shifted or ceased production in 2018, but the remaining mines are expected to increase production in the coming years. As such, we feel the company should be able to grow earnings per share at a rate of 7% per year over the next five years.
While recent results were mixed, Wheaton's business performance over the years concerns us.
2012 earnings per share results: $1.65
2013 earnings per share results: $1.05 (36% decrease)
2014 earnings per share results: 55 cents (48% decrease)
2015 earnings per share results: 53 cents (3.6% decrease)
2016 earnings per share results: 62 cents (17% increase)
2017 earnings per share results: 63 cents (1.6% increase)
2018 earnings per share results: 48 cents (24% decrease)
Even accounting for a 3.8% annual increase in the number of shares outstanding, Wheaton still isn't more profitable than it was in 2012. Our earnings expectations for 2019 are still far below the company's result from 2012. We highly doubt it will be able to create a new earnings per share high in the near future.
Steep declines in profitability have also impacted the company's ability to pay dividends to shareholders. Wheaton first initiated its dividend in 2011. Since then, the company has cut and raised its dividend several times.
While the dividend has increased over the past three years, Wheaton was forced to cut its dividend several times. Investors looking for consistent growth should avoid owning shares of the company as they will likely be disappointed in its dividend increases. Shares yield 1.2% today.
It's not just recent mixed results and historical earnings per share and dividend growth that cause us to advise investors against owning shares of Wheaton. The stock is overvalued right now.
Shares of Wheaton closed the most recent trading session at $29.41. Using our expected earnings for the year of 53 cents per share, the stock has a price-earnings ratio of 55.5. This is the type of valuation normally reserved for high-growth stocks, not those that have posted declining profitability.
We feel that a price-earnings ratio of 25, which is in line with many other companies in this sector and slightly below the stock's 10-year average valuation, is a much more appropriate target. If shares were to revert to this target price-earnings ratio by 2024, the valuation would reduce total annual returns by 14.7% over this period of time.
Total annual returns for Wheaton would consist of the following:
7% earnings per share growth.
We expect Wheaton to lose 6.5% annually over the next five years.
Wheaton's stock has increased nearly 50.6% year to date, which is almost four times as much as the S&P 500. This rapid increase in value has given shares a very expensive valuation. In fact, returning to our target valuation by 2024 would more than offset our projected earnings growth and dividend yield.
We encourage investors still holding shares of Wheaton to consider taking profits.
