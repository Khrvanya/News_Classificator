An update about the environmental review process for Twin Metals. The Bureau of Land Management announced that in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service, they will prepare a detailed Environmental Impact Statement.
Twin Metals Minnesota submitted a proposed operations plan for a mine to produce copper, nickel, cobalt, and precious metals late last year, and has submitted more comments and responses.
Multiple federal agencies and tribal governments will be engaged in the process, and the public will have several opportunities to participate through comment periods. A parallel environmental review process will be led by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
“This is a standard but significant step in the process,” said Julie Padilla, Twin Metals Chief Regulatory Officer. “It signals that the federal government is moving ahead with its regulatory review, which we expect will take a number of years to complete and should include any relevant data from previous studies. We look forward to contributing a decade’s worth of data collection and analysis to support the BLM’s process, which will also include input from the public, coordination with state and federal agencies, and tribal governments.”
Environmental groups still oppose the project.
