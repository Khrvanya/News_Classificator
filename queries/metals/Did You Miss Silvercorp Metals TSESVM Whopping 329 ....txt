Simply Wall St June 5, 2020
Long term investing can be life changing when you buy and hold the truly great businesses. While the best companies are hard to find, but they can generate massive returns over long periods. Just think about the savvy investors who held Silvercorp Metals Inc. ( TSE:SVM ) shares for the last five years, while they gained 329%. And this is just one example of the epic gains achieved by some long term investors. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 32% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently – you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report .
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the five years of share price growth, Silvercorp Metals moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.
Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here .
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Silvercorp Metals the TSR over the last 5 years was 345%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We’re pleased to report that Silvercorp Metals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 98% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 35%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It’s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Silvercorp Metals better, we need to consider many other factors.
