Canadian royalty and streaming company Triple Flag Precious Metals Corp said on Wednesday it is withdrawing a planned initial public offering, citing difficult market conditions, underscoring lacklustre demand for new issues in the mining sector.
Toronto-based Triple Flag, backed by hedge fund Elliot Management Corp, last month said it aimed to raise $360 million by selling 20 million shares at $15 to $18 each for a valuation of up to $2.12 billion.
The company provides up-front financing to miners in exchange for future revenue or a share of production.
The planned listing had been closely watched by investors as a bellwether in a sector that has struggled to attract new financing.
In a statement, Triple Flag said it had been encouraged by investor interest but that the environment for share offerings “continues to be challenging.” The company did not say when or if it would revisit markets.
Investors had pushed Triple Flag to price its deal at a level not comfortable for management, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Triple Flag, led by a former Barrick Gold Corp executive, holds royalty interests in Alamos Gold Inc’s Young-Davidson mine in Ontario and Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd’s Fosterville underground mine in Australia.
Lead underwriters for the offering included Bank of America Securities, CIBC World Markets Inc and Scotia Capital Inc.
Triple Flag is the second Canadian company to ditch plans for a public float in recent weeks. In November, waste management company GFL Environmental abandoned plans to raise up to $2.42 billion.
