The gold futures contract gained 1.08% on Tuesday, as it extended its medium-term uptrend following breaking above last week’s Wednesday’s local high. The market has reached new long-term high of $1,804.0 yesterday. The recent economic data releases didn’t bring any new surprises for the financial markets. However, gold broke above medium-term local highs, as we can see on the daily chart:
Gold is unchanged this morning, as it remains close to yesterday’s daily close. What about the other precious metals? Silver gained 3.17% on Tuesday and today it is trading 0.5% higher. Platinum gained 2.78% yesterday and today it is 1.5% lower, Palladium gained 1.75% on Tuesday and today it’s 1.3% lower. So precious metals are mixed this morning.
Tuesday’s Consumer Confidence release was better than expected. Then stocks were advancing following Fed Chair Powell’s testimony. And today’s ADP Non-Farm Employment Change number came out slightly worse than expected. Investors will now wait for the ISM Manufacturing PMI release at 10:00 a.m., among others.
