Empire Metals* ( LON:EEE ) 1.95p, Mkt cap £3.8m - Munni Munni platinum group metals project acquisition work program
(Empire Metals is earning into a 41% interest in the Munni Munni Palladium Project in the West Pilbara, Western Australia.) (Empire Metals was formerly Georgian Mining*)
Empire Metals reports that the 1,928m drill program at Munni Munni has been completed by Artemis Resources.
Results are expected in three to four weeks from ALS Global.
The press release reminds us that completion of the deal with Artemis ‘is subject to a number of conditions precedent including completion of due diligence, execution of a formal joint venture agreement between the Parties, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and obtaining all necessary third-party consents and approvals to give effect to the proposed acquisition.’
Empire Metals, formerly Georgian Mining, continues to hold and work on the Kvemo Bolnisi project in Georgia where the government has held up permitting for exploration on the project.
The joint venture company received confirmation of tenure from the National Agency of Mines in January for two key deposits including the key Kvemo Bolnisi East project.
Unfortunately the Agency intends to return three further deposits, Kvemo Bolnisi West, Tsitel Sopeli and Balichi,  identified by management to the Georgian State.
Management are appealing to the Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development in Georgia.
The Kvemo Bolnisi project lies close to the Madneuli copper gold mine in Georgia and is held in 50:50 joint venture with Madneuli’s Russian owners.
The company has been forced to impair the value of their Georgian assets but will be able to apply a partial write back in their interim results due to the confirmation of tenure given in January on their two key assets at Kvemo Bolnisi East and Dambludi.
Empire Metals report revenue of £0.1m from operational services.
Group cash at 30 June was £363,000.
Conclusion: Management report good progress at Munni Munni in Australia and positive developments in Georgia. We are hopeful that 2020 should be a transformational year for Empire Metals.

Erris Resources ( LON:ERIS ) 6.1p, Mkt Cap £2.4m – Resumption of Loch Tay exploration
Erris Resources has announced that it is restarting exploration at its Loch Tay gold project in Scotland.
Initial exploration of the Lead Trial prospect is expected to focus on the identification of the source of mineralised boulders located to the east of historic workings and work will include mapping, prospecting and soil-sampling.
Timetables for the earn in period have been extended to reflect delays resulting from the suspension of fieldwork.
Goldstone Resources ( LON:GRL ) 7.15p, Mkt Cap £16.6m – Reduced loss in 2019
Goldstone Resources reports that, in part as a result of a reduction in corporate and administrative expenses, it has reduced its loss for the year ending 31st December 2020 to US$655,000 (2018 loss - US$1.01m).
The company highlights the completion during the year of the Definitive Economic Plan (DEP) for its Akrokeri/Homase gold project in Ghana which outline the development of ʺlow capex, low opex gold productionʺ generating an after-tax NPV10% of US$19.5m and IRR of 143% from an initial capital investment of US$6.5m at an assumed gold price of US$1,300/oz.
The Ghanaian authorities have granted approval ʺfor 10-year mining lease for the Homase South Pit, the first of three planned pits as detailed in the DEP, received in November 2019 and formally awarded post period end in February 2020ʺ.
Chief Executive, Emma Priestly said that ʺThe significant and material developments achieved during 2019 and H1 2020 have laid the foundations for GoldStone to become a gold producer in the near-term.  With a highly compelling Definitive Economic Plan, an approved mining lease and requisite financing secured to establish mining operations, we are now approaching the cusp of becoming a cash generative mining company.  Despite the administrative frustrations that we have recently endured, GoldStone has now emerged as a robust pre-production company, with a clear strategy to produce first gold before the end of 2020 and I believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful value to shareholders."
KEFI Minerals * ( LON:KEFI ) 0.9p, Mkt Cap £18.5m – Tulu Kapi project finance on track for Oct/20 closure and full construction start in Q1/21
Kefi Minerals reports a loss of £5.4m for the year ending 31st December 2019 (2018 loss - £5.0m) and a year-end cash balance of £150,000.
Discussing the progress of the company’s flagship Tulu Kapi gold project in Ethiopia, Executive Chairman, Harry Anagnostaras-Adams, explained that, as a result of the 2020 plan, Tulu Kapi ʺnow has more reliable assumptions due to the finalisation of infrastructure design and the updated cost inputs.ʺ
In the context of stronger gold prices, the company has ʺadopted a gold price range of US$1,400- 1,800/oz for illustrative modelling purposesʺ and taken in conjunction with the revised operational projections, Kefi Minerals now expects Tulu Kapi to achieve all in sustaining costs in the range US$856-884/0z and to deliver average annual EBITDA in the range US$78-129m.
Adjusting for all updated input costs, the Company estimates Tulu Kapi (open pit + underground) to generate NPV8% (after tax) of $363m/£290m at $1,600/oz gold price ($163m/£131m for planned KEFI 45% interest in the project) while the open-pit alone development option producing around140kozpa over eight years and AISC of $856-884/oz generates 45% IRR at the $1,600/oz gold price. ʺthe Definitive Feasibility Study ("DFS") based NPV of the open pit (US$300 million) added to that of the PEA-based NPV of the underground mine (US$110 million), totals to the aggregate Project NPV at 8% of US$411 millionʺ.
The company discusses its base case plan for the ownership of Tulu Kapi which, though still subject to final confirmation, envisages 22% participation by the Ethiopian Government with a further 22% in the hands of private investors with the remaining 56% held by Kefi Minerals’ wholly owned Kefi Minerals (Ethiopia). The ultimate ownership of Kefi Minerals (Ethiopia) is expected to dilute to 80% in the hands of Kefi Minerals leaving it with an effective 45% interest in Tulu Kapi.
The company also discusses the progress of its Saudi Arabian Hawiah copper-zinc-gold-silver prospect where the ʺfirst 69 drill holes identified three distinct massive sulphide lodes which vary in thickness from 3 metres up to a maximum of 19 metres. The overall results to date were encouraging and we are working towards reporting a maiden Mineral Resource for Hawiah in accordance with the JORC Code shortly.ʺ
The company also discloses that it proposes ʺa name-change of the Company to KEFI Gold and Copper PLC, to reinforce our mission and recognise our now-established position in those metals through the discoveries and acquisitions we have madeʺ.
Conclusion: The recent strength in gold prices has led Kefi Minerals to re-evaluate Tulu Kapi at a range of gold prices between US$1,400-1,800/oz resulting in an updated NPV estimate for the company’s share of the project of US$363m. We look forward to the initial mineral resource estimate from Hawiah.
Power Metals Resources* ( LON:POW ) 0.5p, Mkt cap £2.8m – Interim results
Power Metal Resources reports a loss of £256,000 for the six months ending 31st March 2020 (2019 loss - £335,000) and a 31sr March cash balance of £289,000.
The company highlights the decision to confirm that it earning a 40% interest in the Molopo Farms nickel sulphide project in Botswana where it has identified 2020 drilling targets as well as the 20% owned Haneti polymetallic project in Tanzania and the decision to follow up copper-cobalt targest at the 70% owned Kisinka project in DRC.
Subsequent work has identified four target groups at Molopo Farms as well as an expansion into the historic Victoria goldfields in Australia where the company is assembling a land package in an area that is enjoying a resurgence of exploration interest.
The company also announced a conditional agreement ʺto acquire an earn-in right over the Alamo gold project in Arizona, USA, subject to the completion of due diligence.ʺ
CEO, Paul Johnson, said that the company ʺnow has a diverse business model, with a new and developing gold joint venture interest in Australia and base metal interests in Africa.  As a Company we are targeting large scale metal discoveries and in the Board's opinion each project interest we hold has the potential to deliver a large-scale discovery or discoveriesʺ.
Conclusion:  Power Metals continues to build a portfolio of exploration projects across base and precious metals in Australia, Africa and N America
Vast Resources* ( LON:VAST ) 0.21p, Mkt Cap £23.3m – Carlibaba licence granted
The company reports that it has been granted an exploitation licence for the Carlibaba area adjacent to its Manaila polymetallic mine in Romania.
The company reports that ʺThe Manaila Carlibaba exploitation perimeter contains a JORC 2012 compliant Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 3.6Mt grading 0.93% copper, 0.29% lead, 0.63% zinc, 0.23g/t gold and 24.9g/t silver with Inferred Mineral Resources of 1.0Mt grading 1.10% copper, 0.40% lead, 0.84% zinc, 0.24g/r gold and 29.2g/t silver.ʺ
The additional licence expand the compnay’s ground position by over four times to 183.6 hectares which ʺcould allow for a larger mining and processing facility to be developed on site and would eliminate the need for costly road transport of mined ore to the current processing facility located at Iacobeni, approximately 30 kilometers awayʺ.
The company explains that preliminary studies have indicated that the larger licence area might support a 125m deep open-pit mine while also allowing the simultaneous development of ʺa smaller higher-grade underground mine below the open pit mineral resourcesʺ.
Conclusion: The additional licence area expands the range of development options available to Vast Resources at Manaila /  Calibaba with the possibility of a combined open-pit and underground mining operation now under consideration.
