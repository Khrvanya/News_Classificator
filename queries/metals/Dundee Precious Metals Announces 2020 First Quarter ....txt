Cash cost per tonne of ore processed, all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold and cash cost per tonne of concentrate smelted are not defined measures under IFRS. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of the MD&A for reconciliations to IFRS measures.
In the first quarter of 2020, gold contained in concentrate produced increased by 70% to 72,963 ounces due primarily to production from Ada Tepe, which achieved commercial production in the second quarter of 2019, and copper production increased by 17% to 9.4 million pounds due primarily to higher copper grades, in each case, relative to the corresponding period in 2019.
Payable gold in concentrate sold in the first quarter of 2020 increased by 73% to 68,254 ounces relative to the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to deliveries from Ada Tepe, which achieved commercial production in the second quarter of 2019. Payable copper in concentrate sold in the first quarter of 2020 of 9.5 million pounds was 51% higher than the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to the timing of gold-copper concentrate deliveries by Chelopech as there were three deliveries of gold-copper concentrate in the first quarter of 2020 compared to two deliveries in the first quarter of 2019.
Complex concentrate smelted during the first quarter of 2020 of 65,010 tonnes was 3% higher than the corresponding period in 2019 and represents Tsumeb’s second highest quarterly production on record. This increase was due primarily to consistent performance and steady state of operations after the ramp-up following the maintenance shutdown completed during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Cost of sales in the first quarter of 2020 of $90.6 million was $25.9 million higher than the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to increased deliveries as a result of Ada Tepe commencing commercial operation in the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR and Euro.
All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in the first quarter of 2020 of $593 was $226 lower than the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to low-cost gold production from Ada Tepe and higher by-product credits.
Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted during the first quarter of 2020 was $357, which was $13 lower than the corresponding period in 2019. This decrease was due primarily to the favourable impact of a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar and higher volumes of complex concentrate smelted, partially offset by lower acid prices.
Cash provided from operating activities in the first quarter of 2020 of $9.4 million, compared with $14.4 million in the corresponding period in 2019, is not reflective of the significant increase in earnings during the period primarily as a result of a $47.6 million increase in working capital due to the timing of receipts from customers and payments to suppliers. In addition, during the first quarter of 2020, Ada Tepe delivered 13,110 ounces of gold pursuant to the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement resulting in $17.9 million of deferred revenue being recognized in revenue with no corresponding impact on cash as these deliveries were in partial satisfaction of the $50.0 million of upfront proceeds received in 2016 in respect of the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement.
Free cash flow in first quarter of 2020 was $49.2 million compared to $10.0 million in the corresponding period in 2019. This increase was due primarily to higher volumes of gold and copper sold, higher realized gold prices, lower treatment charges and the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR and Euro, partially offset by lower realized copper prices. Also, during the first quarter of 2020, Ada Tepe delivered 13,110 ounces of gold pursuant to the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement resulting in $17.9 million of deferred revenue being recognized in revenue with no corresponding impact on cash as these deliveries were in partial satisfaction of the $50.0 million of upfront proceeds received in 2016 in respect of the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement.
Capital expenditures incurred during the first quarter of 2020 were $9.6 million compared to $20.2 million in the corresponding period in 2019.
Growth capital expenditures(1) incurred during the first quarter of 2020 were $2.8 million compared to $17.7 million in the corresponding period in 2019. The period over period decline in growth capital expenditures was related principally to the construction of the Ada Tepe gold mine, which was completed in 2019. Sustaining capital expenditures(1) incurred during the first quarter of 2020 were $6.8 million, in line with guidance, compared to $2.5 million in the corresponding period in 2019. This increase was due primarily to spending at Ada Tepe, which commenced commercial production in the second quarter of 2019, work on the tailings management facility at Chelopech and the timing of projects at Tsumeb.
The Company filed a National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101’”) Technical Report on August 29, 2019 supporting the preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) of the Timok gold project. The PEA is based on the updated Mineral Resource estimate completed in September 2018 and provided a base case which primarily considered the oxide and transitional material types. Following encouraging results from the optimization work completed in 2019 to incorporate the sulphide portion of the resource, the Company has initiated a prefeasibility study, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. For additional details, refer to the press releases entitled “Dundee Precious Metals Files NI 43-101 Technical Report Supporting the Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Timok Gold Project in Serbia” dated August 29, 2019 and “NI 43-101 Technical Report – Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Timok Gold Project Serbia” dated November 7, 2018, both found on DPM’s website and filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .
At Chelopech, diamond drilling from surface continued through the first quarter of 2020 at the Wedge South target and at the Krasta prospect. In Serbia, drilling in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 defined a new area of shallow oxide mineralization at the Timok gold project as well as an extension of copper gold porphyry mineralization at depth at the Tulare project. In Quebec, a winter drill program on the Malartic property was suspended in accordance with the order related to COVID-19 issued by the Government of Quebec.
As at March 31, 2020, DPM had fully repaid all debt and had a cash position of $13.6 million, as well as $31.9 million of investments, comprised primarily of its 10.3% interest in Sabina and 19.4% equity interest in INV Metals Inc. (“INV”), and $175.0 million of undrawn capacity under its RCF. After the delivery of 13,110 ounces of gold under its prepaid gold facility during the first quarter of 2020, the Company has 20,977 ounces of gold to deliver during the remainder of 2020.
Consistent with the Company’s disciplined capital allocation framework, on February 13, 2020, the Company declared an inaugural quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common share, which was paid on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 31, 2020. As at March 31, 2020, the Company recognized a dividend payable of $3.6 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position and a corresponding dividend distribution against its retained earnings in the condensed interim consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.
On May 6, 2020, the Company declared a second quarter dividend of $0.02 per common share, which is payable on July 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2020.
The level of the Company’s dividend is based on establishing a sustainable dividend having regard for the Company’s free cash flow outlook and is expected to allow the Company to build additional balance sheet strength to support further growth, a key element of DPM’s strategy. The declaration, amount and timing of any future dividend are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be assessed based on the Company’s capital allocation framework, having regard for the Company’s financial position, overall market conditions, and its outlook for sustainable free cash flow, capital requirements, and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors.
DPM is on track to meet its previously issued guidance for 2020 for each of its operations, including expected gold production of 257,000 to 299,000 ounces and 35 to 40 million pounds of copper. DPM continues to expect all-in sustaining cost of $700 to $780 per ounce, and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted of $370 to $450. Over the balance of 2020, 20,977 ounces of gold will be used to fully settle the Company’s prepaid forward gold sale. For additional information regarding the Company’s detailed guidance for 2020, please refer to the “Three-Year Outlook” section of the MD&A.
If foreign exchange rates and copper prices remain unchanged from current spot levels over the balance of the year, 2020 cash costs are expected to be at or below the low end of guidance.
(1) Adjusted net earnings (loss), adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold, cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb, net of by-product credits, free cash flow, and growth and sustaining capital expenditures have no standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). Presenting these measures from period to period helps management and investors evaluate earnings and cash flow trends more readily in comparison with results from prior periods. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2020 (the “MD&A”) for further discussion of these items, including reconciliations to IFRS measures.
