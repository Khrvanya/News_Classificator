With so much attention paid to the novel coronavirus and the pandemic’s economic and geopolitical implications, multiple industries have fallen by the wayside in terms of visibility. But at some point, our modernized societies must turn back to the innovations and technologies that have driven them in the pre-pandemic era. Therefore, the case for battery stocks to buy is a compelling one.
First, although the global spread of Covid-19 had shuttered viable economies, our dependency on tech hasn’t diminished. In fact, you can make the argument that it has only accelerated. As a prime example, millions of white-collar workers in the U.S. suddenly found themselves operating from home. This may lead to overall higher demand for lithium battery stocks to buy as people ramp up usage of laptops, smartphones and other digital devices.
Second, demand for batteries doesn’t necessarily have to involve “serious” endeavors. With the lockdowns, billions across the globe had to find ways to fill the time. For developed and top-tier developing nations, many found solace in video games. And what powers modern wireless game controllers? In many cases, it’s lithium.
Another big development is the role of electric vehicles. To be fully transparent, I haven’t been the biggest fan of EVs. At the same time, consumer demand has steadily increased. Granted, the economics of EVs may take a hit, given that combustion-based vehicles will probably be sold at steep discounts due to the pandemic.
But in the long run, this is a space to consider, if have the stomach for potential volatility. Below are eight battery stocks to buy if you do:
