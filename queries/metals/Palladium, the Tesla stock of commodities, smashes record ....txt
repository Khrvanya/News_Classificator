“Palladium has been unbelievable — it’s like the Tesla stock of commodities,” Edward Meir, an analyst at ED&F Man Capital Markets, said by phone. “Prices are caught up in the rally in precious metals. Whenever these metals rally palladium tends to move as well, but by a greater magnitude.”
Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 7.5 per cent to US$2,489.70 an ounce at 11:45 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after reaching US$2,498.20, the highest on records going back three decades. In the spot market, the metal reached an all-time high of US$2,589.
Gold futures rose 1.3 per cent to US$1,607.50 an ounce on the Comex in New York. The tally of outstanding contracts for the metal more than 30 times the size of palladium.
Palladium’s stellar performance has been driven by expectations that stricter Chinese environmental standards will spur higher loadings of the material in cars, draining global supply that’s already struggling to meet demand.
Production will trail consumption by 1.9 million ounces this year, wider than the 1.1 million ounce-deficit last year, Anglo American Platinum Chief Executive Officer Chris Griffith said in a presentation.
