Precious metals and energy counters slipped while base metals gained on Monday ahead of the formal signing of the trade deal between US and China later this week.
Crude oil was down 0.29 per cent to Rs 4,190, while natural gas dipped 1.07 per cent to Rs 156.60. Nickel and copper, on the other hand, advanced up to 0.40 per cent on MCX.
Most agri commodity counters were trading with cuts on NCDEX. Among the biggest losers were oil countersâ€”cotton seed oilcake, mustard seed, castor seed and soybean.
