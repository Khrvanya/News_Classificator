Platinum and silver have been badly battered, too.
Platinum fell 26% to $588 on Monday, while silver fell 12% to $12.96.

In the 2008 financial crisis, a similar pattern emerged with funds liquidating assets as share prices went into meltdown. Precious metals rallied from their October 2008 lows, up by 45% within months, whereas shares continued to fall through to March the following year.
