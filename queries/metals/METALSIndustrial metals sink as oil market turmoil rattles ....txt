LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Industrial metals prices fell on Tuesday, with copper down more than 2% as a collapse in oil prices rattled investors, pushing global stock markets lower and the dollar higher.
Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was 2.7% lower at $5,045 a tonne at 1600 GMT, down from Monday’s one-month high of $5,248.
Prices of the metal used in power and construction had rebounded from $4,371 - a four-year low - in March on hopes that the worst of the coronavirus crisis may have passed, particularly in China, the biggest metals user.
“It looks like a typical risk off day,” said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke. “After the recent rally you don’t need a big excuse to take profit,” he said.
MARKETS/OIL: Global stock markets slumped and benchmark Brent oil plunged as much as 30% after U.S. oil futures on Monday turned negative for the first time.
DOLLAR: The U.S. dollar rose back towards last month’s three-year highs, making metals costlier for buyers with other currencies.
CONTRACTION: Australia’s economy will shrink 10% in the first half of 2020, the governor of its central bank said, while South Korean exports plunged nearly 27% in the first 20 days of April.
GERMANY: The mood among German investors improved in April, a survey showed on Tuesday.
CHINA PREMIUMS: In China, the biggest market, where industry is reopening, Yangshan copper import premiums rose to $84 a tonne, up from $55 in February and the highest since September. SMM-CUYP-CN
