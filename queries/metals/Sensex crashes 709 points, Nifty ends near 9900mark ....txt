‚ÄúStock markets around the world retreated Thursday as fears over a second wave of coronavirus infections and a gloomy economic outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve distressed investors. Asian markets mostly fell in early trading Thursday, following losses on Wall Street after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economic recovery will be ‚Äúa long road,‚Äù Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities said in a statement after the market hours.
The rupee depreciated 20 paise to provisionally close at 75.79 against the US dollar on Thursday as strengthening US dollar and weak domestic equities weighed on investor sentiment, news agency PTI reported.
The rupee opened weak at 75.81 at the interbank forex market and recovered some lost ground to close at 75.79 against US dollar, down 20 paise over its last close. It had settled at 75.59 against the US dollar on Wednesday.
During the four-hour trading session, the rupee touched an intra-day high of 75.72 and a low of 75.88.
World shares took their biggest tumble in five weeks on Thursday as a sobering outlook from the US Federal Reserve challenged market optimism on the global economy, while bonds rallied on bets yet more stimulus would be needed to ensure recovery.
Asia saw a 10-day winning streak come to an abrupt finish and Europe‚Äôs main bourses all opened with a heavy thud.
London‚Äôs FTSE, Frankfurt‚Äôs DAX and Paris‚Äôs CAC40 were all down more than 2.5 per cent in what for coronavirus-sensitive sectors such as carmakers and travel and tourism was a fourth straight day of drops.
MSCI‚Äôs 49-country index of world stocks slid 0.75 per cent in its largest daily loss in five weeks, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to extend the previous session‚Äôs pullback on Wall Street.
In a reality check to the stock market‚Äôs recent euphoria, the Fed predicted the US economy would shrink 6.5 per cent in 2020 and unemployment would still be at 9.3 per cent at year‚Äôs end.
Data had also shown core US consumer prices fell for a third straight month in May, the longest stretch of declines on record.
As a result, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he was ‚Äúnot even thinking about thinking about raising rates‚Äù. Instead, he emphasised recovery would be a long road and that policy would have to be proactive with rates near zero out to 2022.
