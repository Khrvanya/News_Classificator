An additional two dill rigs will be added this week for a total of four, Benchmark said
Benchmark Metals Inc. ( CVE:BNCH ) ( OTCQB:CYRTF ) (WKN:A2JM2X) has announced the start of resource expansion and definition drilling at its Lawyers gold-silver project located in the Golden Horseshoe of north-central British Columbia.
The company said it has already completed in excess of 270 metres of drilling with two drill rigs positioned and turning at the Cliff Creek Zone (CCZ). An additional two dill rigs will be added this week for a total of four, and all the drill holes will be logged and sampled in preparation for assay analysis.
In a statement, John Williamson, Benchmark’s CEO commented: "The Company has embarked on the largest drill program in the Toodogonne region. The drill rigs have started at Cliff's with additional drilling to soon commence at the ABG Zone.
“In 2019 drilling encountered multiple new zones and large extensions across multiple areas at the heart of the property. Every zone still remains open in all directions and as such, we anticipate more new mineralization to be discovered with the drill".
Selected previous drill results from the Cliff Creek Zone include 2.40 meters (m) at 87 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 2,407 g/t silver, plus 36.50m at 2.68 g/t gold & 82.57 g/t silver.
The company said it has up to 50,000 metres of planned drilling with the majority of new drilling focused on resource expansion and definition drilling.
Benchmark sees potential to convert the existing exploration targets into a multi-million-ounce gold-silver Mineral Resource Estimate. A limited amount of drilling will test new exploration targets that exhibit anomalous geological features for the discovery of new, at surface, mineralized zones.
The road-accessible Lawyers Gold-Silver Project is located 45 kilometers from the world-class Kemess Au-Cu Porphyry Deposit.
