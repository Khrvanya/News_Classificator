While the Stoxx 600 slid in Friday trade, it ended the week with a 2 per cent advance. Wall St was closed to mark Independence Day.
Australian shares shot higher on Thursday, with Afterpay surging to a new record high and other tech stocks jumping as well, as the sector took a lead from a strong performance in the US tech sector.
The S&P/ASX 200 Index ended the day 1.7 per cent, or 98 points, higher at 6032.70. The gains in Australia followed a solid session overnight on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose strongly and State Street strategist Marija Veitmane noted that US tech stocks have been trading around levels last seen just prior to the dot.com crash, the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000.
"Whilst this has prompted speculation of the imminent correction within the sector, we would disagree and note that it is in fact both prices and earnings that have grown.”
“Despite prices having now recovered to their previous highs, earnings have greatly surpassed them and as such, stocks within the technology sector have enjoyed superior earnings power," she said. “We expect them to remain highly profitable in the new-technology-driven normal.”
In Australian trading, Afterpay shares shot up 9.5 per cent to $68.16, a new high. The company's extraordinary rally since March 23 has placed it just outside the top 20 largest stocks on the local market.
A number of other local tech stocks also performed strongly, with WiseTech gaining 6.2 per cent to $19.70, Bravura Solutions rising 4.8 per cent to $4.55, and Nearmap up 4.7 per cent at $2.45.
The big banks all performed well, as Commonwealth Bank advanced 1.8 per cent to $71.10, ANZ climbed 2 per cent to $19.26, Westpac firmed 1.8 per cent to $18.61 and National Australia Bank rose 1.8 per cent to $18.90.
Other blue chip gainers included CSL, up 1.9 per cent to $289.72 and Telstra, which increased 1.6 per cent to $3.23. Aristocrat Leisure soared 5.6 per cent to $26.77, Goodman Group added 4.3 per cent to $15.63 and QBE Insurance advanced 6.1 per cent to $9.34.
The major miners were also firmer despite opening the session weaker. BHP Group rose 0.5 per cent to $36.01 while Fortescue Metals Group climbed 2 per cent to $14.03.
The local coal sector rose on reports that Japan was planning to retire 90 per cent of its older coal-fired power plans in the next decade, with Whitehaven Coal gaining 4.5 per cent to close at $1.50.
NIB Holdings rose 4.5 per cent to $4.84 after it confirmed its forecast capital position remains well ahead of the mandated regulatory requirements as well as internal targets.
Kathmandu soared 9.3 per cent to $1.17 after reporting same-store sales for the six weeks ended June 28 rose 21 per cent in its Ripcurl stores and 12.5 per cent at its Kathmandu stores, with strong contributions from online.
On the downside, AMP shares slid 0.8 per cent to $1.87. AMP Capital's new chief executive Boe Pahari is facing internal pressure from staff following revelations he was promoted to the top role after settling a sexual harassment claim brought by a female employee.
Gold miners also traded lower. Northern Star Resources fell 0.6 per cent to $14.22 and Evolution Mining declined 0.3 per cent to $6, while Resolute Mining slipped 1.7 per cent to $1.20.
The Tuas Group has been spun out as a standalone entity as part of the proposed merger of equals between TPG Australia and Vodafone Hutchinson Australia.
Newly merged Vodafone and TPG has been launched as a new listing on the ASX.
TPG Singapore owns 4G mobile spectrum and operating licences on the island state, with 7,000 paying subscribers and 412,000 free trial users.
It was recently unsuccessful in an auction for 5G Singapore spectrum, although it can apply for localised rollouts from the end of 2020.
Shares will trade on a deferred settlement basis until on or about July 14.
Analysts at UBS are tipping Telstra as a buy partly on the back of recent mobile plan price increases implemented on customers.
"TLS has increased the pricing (and data quotas) across most of its consumer postpaid plans," wrote the broker.
"Pricing has been lifted by $5/mth on the 'S' (now $55 for 40GB, previously $50 for 30GB), 'M' (now $65 for 80GB, previously $60 for 60GB), and 'L' (now $85 for 120GB, previously $80 for 100GB) plans. The 'XL' plan sees a $15/mth increase (now $115 for 180GB, previously $100 for 100GB)."
As a result of the changes the broker estimates around a $300 million to $400 million earnings uplift for Telstra. In total over FY20-FY23 UBS estimates Telstra could see mobile revenues climb around $700 million, with EBITDA up around $600 million over the period.
UBS expects Telstra's forecast underlying EBITDA of around $7.7 billion for financial 2023 should be sufficient to maintain a 16 cents per share dividend on a payout ratio of 70 to 90 per cent out to financial 2023.
It has however maintained its forecast for a 14 cents per share payout in financial 2021.
"Upside exists if Optus and Vodafone lift mobile pricing to follow TLS, or if TLS changes its dividend policy," wrote the broker.
"Trading at ~$3.18, the market in any case does not seem to be factoring in the possibility for a sustained increase in industry pricing and ROICs. Risk vs. reward therefore looks favourable here."
It has a buy rating and $3.70 valuation on Telstra shares.
The world’s most powerful central bank, the US Federal Reserve, gave the idea of yield-targeting controls a largely cool reception when members discussed the policy tool at their two-day policy meeting last month, the minutes from that meeting show.
The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan have embraced yield-curve control, and the RBA vowed to keep the three-year yield pinned at 0.25 per cent as part of a wider adoption of unconventional monetary policy in March.
Other central banks have been eyeing the RBA's success to date in keeping the three-year yield pinned to 0.25 per cent since March. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell told the US Congress in mid-June that it had been briefed on the RBA's use of yield-curve control.
Tony Morriss, Bank of America chief economist for Australia, said the RBA’s forward guidance was very specific and referred to "quite a limited period of time when those rates might have been needed".
Gold bugs have a new ally in powerful investment bank Macquarie, which is tipping the precious metal to trade towards $US2000/oz over the first quarter of financial 2021. Over the quarter it expects gold to average $US1825/oz.
"In the short-term it is receiving an additional bid from geopolitical concerns around Hong Kong’s national security legislation, with futures’ prices briefly trading above $1,800/oz," wrote the analysts.
"Nevertheless, the market’s dominant driver remains US real rates, which our economists believe will remain suppressed by Fed policy, while our FX colleagues’ call for an unravelling of USD strength could also provide a tailwind for gold into November’s presidential election."
Macquarie is bullish on the US dollar gold price, but not local gold miners.
Despite its bullish views on the gold price the broker only has an outperform rating on one gold miner under its ASX investment coverage. The miner Macquarie likes is Aurelia Metals, which is up 13.6 per cent to 58 cents in afternoon trade.
It downgraded Newcrest Mining, Regis Resources, St Barbara and Resolute Mining to underperform partly as it expects a stronger Australian dollar to put a break on earnings. Local gold miners take operating costs in Australian dollars, before selling the metal in US dollars.
Shaw and Partners was pitching a parcel of 21.4 million shares in ASX-listed gold exploration company Matador Mining on Thursday.
The broker launched the block trade at 28¢ a share, which was a 12.5 per cent discount to the last close, and was calling for bids by early afternoon.
Funds were told the block trade followed completion of a Cadanian flow through placement of 21.4 million shares at 40.6¢ each.
Funds raised were pegged for exploration activities and study and permitting.
Matador Mining shares were in a trading halt on Thursday while the bookbuild took place.

Goldman Sachs runs numbers on Freedom Foods, drops conviction
Embattled cereals, snacks and dairy company Freedom Foods rocketed to the top of equity raising watchlists last week when it announced a $60 million inventory write down and its CEO and CFO left the building.
Former Freedom Foods CEO Rory Macleod.
Talk about a triple whammy for shareholders.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs have modelled what a $150 million equity raising would mean for shareholders who are already bracing for the stock to tank once PwC and Ashurst finish an investigation into Freedom's finances and it resumes trading.
In a note to clients on Thursday, the analysts said earnings per share could drop between 18 per cent and 27 per cent depending on how deeply discounted the offer was.
The analysts said a $150 million equity raising would reduce Freedom's net debt to EBITDA to 2.5 times by December 2020.
