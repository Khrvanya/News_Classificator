NEW DELHI: Metal shares were trading on a mixed note in Saturday's session ahead of Union Budget scheduled to be announced today.
Metals and mining sector is eyeing reduction of import duties on coking coal and metallurgical (met) coke and an increase in import duty on aluminum scrap, in addition to a reduction in dividend distribution tax (DDT).
A reduction in import duty on coking coal and coke may lower input costs for Tata Steel, JSW Steel, JSPL and SAIL, said Antique Stock Broking. Cess on coal is currently levied at Rs 400 per tonne. If it is removed, it would be positive for steel makers such as JSW Steel, said Sharekhan. If the government increases aluminum scrap import duty, it should be positive for Hindalco, Vedanta and Nalco. It will be marginally negative for steel producers engaged in produced aluminum coated steel. Meanwhile, any move to cut dividend distribution tax will be positive for cash-rich Hindustan Zinc, MOIL, NMDC and Nalco.
Shares of Hindustan Copper (up 3.06 per cent) , APL Apollo Tubes (up 2.68 per cent) , JSW Steel (up 1.76 per cent) , Hindustan Zinc (up 1.21 per cent) , National Aluminium Company (up 1.06 per cent) , Ratnamani Metals & Tubes (up 1.03 per cent) , Welspun Corp (up 0.82 per cent) , Hindalco Industries (up 0.11 per cent) and MOIL (up 0.1 per cent) were among the top gainers.
While NMDC Ltd (down 3.51 per cent) , Coal India (down 2.2 per cent) , Jindal Steel & Power (down 1.71 per cent) , Tata Steel (down 1.15 per cent) and Vedanta (down 0.69 per cent) were the top losers in the index.
