Who Has Been Buying Spectrum Metals Limited (ASX:SPX) Shares?
It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. On the other hand, we'd be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Spectrum Metals Limited ( ASX:SPX ).
Most investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.
Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own companyâ€™s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.
insider Anthony Barton made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$233k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.024 each. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of AU$0.089. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive.
Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid AU$314k for 13.12m shares. But insiders sold 3800000 shares worth AU$91k. Overall, Spectrum Metals insiders were net buyers last year.
