A major mixed-use development in West Midtown is moving forward with leasing efforts, inking a major deal with an international hospitality brand recently.
The Star Metals Atlanta development, straddling the fast-evolving Howell Mill Road corridor, recently secured a deal with Social Entertainment Ventures .
Although the new tenant has not yet specified what its incoming concept will be—it’s launched destinations centered around ping-pong and darts in the past—officials say it will open in summer 2021.
Developed by The Allen Morris Company , the Star Metals complex is ultimately expected to feature 185,000 square feet of office space, 409 luxury residential units, 48,000 square feet of retail options, and a 176-key hotel.
Most of that retail space will be housed at the ground floor of the 14-story, tiered office tower, where Social Entertainment Ventures is setting up shop.

It’s unclear where exactly within the building the new attraction will be located—SRS officials have not yet responded to Curbed Atlanta’s request for more information—but the Oppenheim Architecture-designed tower is designed be more than your everyday office structure.
With interior spaces designed by local firm Square Feet Studio, the office building is slated to feature a 10,000-square-foot amenity level on the seventh floor that would be replete with an outdoor terrace for tenant collaborations and special events, a conference room, boardroom, and covered outdoor seating.
