Europa Metals Ltd ( LON:EUZ ) said it will ask shareholders to approve a 500-for-one share consolidation as part of its annual general meeting next month.
The lead-zinc and silver projects developer said the AGM will be held online on 15 July due to coronavirus social distancing.
Further to a cost cutting programme already implemented at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, the board is seeking to put in place a new share option plan to help incentivise key staff.
Europa recently unveiled results from the second phase metallurgical testing at its Toral project , which is situated in the Castilla y León region in north-west Spain, that it said demonstrated the potential for high-grade saleable and marketable lead and zinc, with recovery results at the higher end of management’s expectations.
