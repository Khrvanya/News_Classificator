Benchmark Metals Inc (CVE:BNCH) (OTCQB:CYRTF) has kicked off its 50,000 metre drill program in the Toodoggone region of British Columbia, it announced Wednesday.
The Edmonton-based company is pursuing the largest drill program in the region. In the current program, Benchmark will focus new drilling on resource expansion and definition drilling where it sees potential to convert existing targets into a multi-million-ounce gold-silver mineral resource estimate. Drilling will also test new exploration targets with anomalous geological features.
The company will have five drill rigs turning and anticipates results from late July to December, 2020, according to Benchmark CEO John Williamson.
“The aggressive drill program is the first major milestone towards establishing a new resource estimate to be followed by economics that demonstrate the viability of a new gold-silver mine,” Williamson told investors in a statement.
Benchmark is advancing more than six tertiary targets for new discovery potential in copper-gold porphyry areas.
In addition to drilling, the 2020 exploration program will include induced polarization and magnetotellurics geophysical surveys along with ground magnetics at multiple zones. Benchmark will also conduct detailed bedrock, alteration and structural mapping and extensive soil and bedrock sampling across new targets.
The company has raised over C$24 million since its inception from cornerstone investors like mining magnate Eric Sprott, who is Benchmark’s largest shareholder. It has denoted C$8.5 million for its 2020 exploration program.
