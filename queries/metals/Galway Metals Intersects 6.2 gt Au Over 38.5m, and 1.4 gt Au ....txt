TORONTO, ONTARIO / ACCESSWIRE / June 1, 2020 / Galway Metals Inc. (TSXV:GWM) (the "Company" or "Galway") is pleased to report assay results from drilling on the western-most section of the Richard Zone at the Company's Clarence Stream project in southwest New Brunswick, Canada ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). These are located 76m and 34m above (centre of each zone) the previously reported intersection of 2.4 g/t Au over 30.0m, and 178m west and along the same vein as the previously reported intersection of 10.6 g/t Au over 47.0m. The latest results are highlighted by:
Hole 101 intersected 6.2 grams per tonne (g/t) Au over 38.5 metres (m), including 373.0 g/t Au over 0.5m (VG), and 12.6 g/t Au over 0.95m, plus 7.0 g/t Au over 1.0m starting at vertical depths of 122m and 66m below surface, respectively.
The 3 highest grade individual assays from drilling on the entire Clarence Stream property are now all from Galway's 2 new discoveries. In addition to the 373.0 g/t Au over 0.5m intersect in hole 101, the other 2 highest grade assays are 0 g/t Au over 0.5m (from the 10.6 g/t Au over 47.0m in the Richard Zone), and 807.0 g/t Au over 1.25m (from the 241.5 g/t Au over 4.2m in the George Murphy Zone (GMZ)) ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 and Figure 4 ).
Hole 100 intersected 1.4 g/t Au over 85.0m, including 24.2 g/t Au over 1.0m, 12.7 g/t Au over 1.0m, 6.1 g/t Au over 1.0m, 5.2 g/t Au over 1.0m (VG), 4.9 g/t Au over 1.0m, 4.1 g/t Au over 1.0m, 4.1 g/t Au over 1.0m, 3.4 g/t Au over 1.0m, and 3.3 g/t Au over 1.0m, starting at a vertical depth of 118m below surface. This 85.0m intersect is the widest anywhere at Clarence Stream to date (core length and true width).
Galway continues to receive overwhelming evidence from drill results that the GMZ, Richard and Jubilee Zones are part of the same 2.5 km-long mineralized system. Galway's strong drill results demonstrate that Clarence Stream is an emerging new gold district in North America.
Robert Hinchcliffe, President and CEO of Galway Metals, said, "The wide and high-grade intersections in holes 101, 100 and 87 are among the best in the company's history, and all these and other strong intersects in proximity to one another bodes very well for the Clarence Stream resource update scheduled for the 1st quarter of 2021, both from the perspective of any pit-constrained or underground resource estimate. The resource has been pushed back due to COVID-19 delays, as this will provide time for Galway to fill in the gaps between the 3 mineralized zones not yet in resource."
The intersects in holes 101 and 100 are on the same section as holes 93 below (2.4 g/t Au over 30.0m) and hole 91 above. Hole 91 has all assays pending where it intersected the zones. Assays are also pending for other veins in holes 100, 101 and 93, and in other holes to the east. Hole 101 also intersected a vein that returned 7.0 g/t Au over 1.0m that likely lines up with the Richard Zone discovery hole intersection of 7.3 g/t Au over 36.7m, located 271 metres to the northeast.
Holes 101, 100 and 93 intersected the same vein as previously released intersects in holes 78, 87, 72, 84 and 69, which demonstrates excellent grade and width continuity in the Richard Zone ( Figure 3 ). These intersects include:
The intersections in holes 101 and 100 are 298m and 282m, respectively, southwest of, and in a different vein than the previously released discovery hole intersection at Richard in BL18-12, which returned 7.3 g/t Au over 36.7m, including 38.1 g/t Au over 6.5m in multiple quartz veins containing abundant visible gold, starting only 51 metres downhole and 36 metres vertical.
There is a 350m gap to the west of holes 101, 100, 93 and 91, until the Jubilee Zone is reached with an intersection that returned 3.0 g/t Au over 12.0m in hole 68. Hole 76, drilled in that gap area, has assays pending where the zone should be. There is also a 650m gap to the east of Richard discovery hole 12 until the GMZ is reached with an intersection that returned 9.7 g/t Au over 2.0m in hole CL20-88 (with assays pending for 2 holes drilled between these two zones). Hole 88 also returned 6.5 g/t Au over 14.0m (among several other mineralized intersects) that was located 192m from the next nearest intersect in the GMZ, 137m vertically below that intersect, and 335m below surface. This was by far the deepest intersect in any of the three zones - Jubilee, Richard and GMZ - as most are well within 150m from surface. This indicates depth potential at Clarence Stream remains open.
Galway resumed drilling with 3 rigs at Clarence Stream in late May. Galway's plan over the next several months is to continue drilling the 2 gaps between the zones, to tighten drill spacings - generally to 50 metres for inclusion in the pending resource update, and to follow-up on the recent new discoveries of multiple veins to the north of the GMZ, which includes 11.4 g/t Au over 2.0m in hole CL20-58.
Galway will also convert one rig to wide-diameter (PQ-size) core for both ore sorting and metallurgical tests of the 3 zones not yet in resource. Metallurgical tests have been conducted by previous operators on the North and South Zones, which returned recoveries in excess of 90% in both zones.
The section for holes 101, 100, 93 and 91 has a much flatter dip (37°) than the rest of the Richard Zone to the east of it (62°), and flatter than the Jubilee Zone (52°). To date, the zones have mimicked the dip of the intrusive located ~100m to the north of Richard. The section is similar visually to the rest of the Richard Zone - remobilized quartz stockworks and massive veins (15%-20% together) with 1-2% disseminated arsenopyrite.
