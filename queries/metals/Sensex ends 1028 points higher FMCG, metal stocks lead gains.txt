After falling over 23% in a month, Sensex and Nifty have gained 10% and 9% during a week as markets were buoyed by policymakers taking strict actions to support the coronavirus-hit economy.
With two-thirds of the population living in developing countries facing unprecedented economic damage from the COVID-19 crisis, many brokerages expect growth forecasts to be lower and global demand slowdown to be much larger than anticipated. Governments across the planet have introduced lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus, hammering demand and supply chains on a global level.
World Bank in an economic update on Monday said that the coronavirus pandemic is expected to sharply slow growth in developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific as well as China.
Morgan Stanley also said lockdown measures are likely to impact growth across sectors and the output is expected to contract in the quarter ended June. The brokerage expects some normalisation in economic activity from Q3 of FY 20.
Financial markets worldwide have taken a big hit from the pandemic as investor sentiment remained fragile on growth of the global economy.
Since the start of 2020, Sensex, Nifty, BSE Smallcap as well as Midcap have fallen over 31%.

On the other hand, auto index on BSE led losses with 42% drop followed by Realty and Bankex on BSE at 41% loss since the beginning of this year.
Expressing his views on market outlook, Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking said," We're seeing consistent buying interest in select FMCG majors and in fact some of these stocks are trading on the verge of making a new record high. Besides, select counters from the pharma pack too are attracting noticeable interest. On the flip side, PSU banking, auto and metal are seeing selling pressure on every rebound. Traders should align their positions keeping in mind the prevailing scenario. On the other hand, investors should not worry much about the daily fluctuations and maintain their focus on accumulating quality names in a phased manner."
