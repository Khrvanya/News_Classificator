Here’s the weekly price chart for one of the major gold stocks that has a following:
Newmont Goldcorp weekly price chart 10 19 19.
Newmont Goldcorp averages 7 million shares traded daily, so this makes it accessible to big institutions such as hedge funds. Since it’s big and New York Stock Exchange-listed, information about the company is relatively easy to come by. Deutsche Bank analysts just moved Newmont from “hold” to “buy.” The analysts at Citigroup have had the stock on their buy list since May.
Here’s the weekly chart for another NYSE-traded miner:
Barrick Gold weekly price chart, 10 19 19.
Barrick Gold trades an average daily volume of 16.9 million shares. You can see that the stock doubled in price from the September, 2018 low of 10 to the recent high at 20, where it’s backed off a bit. The analysts at Raymond James just moved Barrick from the “perform” to “outperform.”
One more weekly chart – this is a silver stock that tends to trade right along with the gold miners:
Pan American Silver weekly price chart, 10 19 19.
Pan American Silver is NASDAQ-traded with average daily volume of 3.5 million shares. What is interesting about this chart is the resistance line connecting the 2016 peak with the 2017 high. As the stock approaches this level once again, price chart analysts will be watching to see if it can break out and close above that 20/21 spot.
This is the point-and-figure look for the Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange traded fund that’s widely followed as a benchmark for tech stocks:

I do not hold positions in these investments. No recommendations are made one way or the other.  If you're an investor, you'd want to look much deeper into each of these situations. You can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments. Always do your own independent research, due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor.
