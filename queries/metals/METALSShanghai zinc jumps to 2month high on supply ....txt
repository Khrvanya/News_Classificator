SINGAPORE, April 29 (Reuters) - Zinc prices advanced on Wednesday due to supply disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and as improving demand in China added support.
The most traded June zinc contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) climbed as much as 2.1% to 16,415 yuan ($2,320.01) a tonne, its highest since Feb. 28. The contract closed up 1.8% at 16,365 yuan a tonne.
Benchmark three-month zinc on London Metal Exchange (LME) rose as high as $1,947.50 a tonne, the highest since April 20, before easing slightly to trade up 0.9% at $1,947 a tonne at 0705 GMT.
“Zinc treatment charges (TCs) declined very fast in recent weeks due to the shortage in supply of concentrate and we expect some zinc smelters to cut production in Q2-Q3,” said Dina Yu, analyst at CRU Group.
Spot TCs of zinc AM-TC50-ZNCON, or fees that miners pay smelters to process zinc ore into refined metal, have been hovering at a one-year low of $245 a tonne, data from industry pricing and information provider Asian Metal showed.
“Demand is recovering in March and April (in China), but the demand for export is weakening slightly,” Yu said.
