The Dundee Precious Metals (TSE:DPM) Share Price Has Gained 158%, So Why Not Pay It Some Attention?
Simply Wall St December 9, 2019
The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don’t use leverage) is 100% of your money. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the Dundee Precious Metals Inc. ( TSE:DPM ) share price is 158% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! It’s also up 50% in about a month.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company’s share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
Dundee Precious Metals became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it’s not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.
