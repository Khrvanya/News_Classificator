BECKER, Minn. â€” The superintendent of Becker Public Schools said classes are canceled for Thursday, even as firefighters from multiple departments continue to fight a stubborn fire at a nearby recycling plant .
The district had said on Tuesday that school would remain open as it continued to monitor air quality, and make its decisions "based on wind direction, indoor air quality, and recommendations from city and county leadership."
Then Wednesday, Schmidt cited a new Becker Police news release that said, "The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Health recommend that people who have concerns about their health should seek advice from a medical care professional. In the meantime, advice to shelter in place or move away from the source of the smoke is the right advice for nearby occupants."
Schmidt said the district is encouraging everyone to follow those recommendations.
