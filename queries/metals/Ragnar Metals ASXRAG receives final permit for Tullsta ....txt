Once travel restrictions have lifted and it is safe to go to Sweden, field validation works, landowner meetings, and inspections can begin
Ragnar Metals (RAG) has received the final permit for the Tullsta Nickel Project and can now begin working.
The Tullsta Nickel Project is located near Sala in the Bergslagen District of Sweden, 110 kilometres from Stockholm.
It is made up of five neighbouring permits and covers an area of 136.44 square kilometres.
Tullsta nr8, the recently granted permit, joins the already granted Berga nr1 permit which contains the Granmuren Nickel Mineralisation.
It is believed that the Granmuren Nickel Mineralisation runs down into the Tullsta nr8 area at depth.
This is significant for Ragnar Metals given the potential it hosts.
"The granting of the Tullsta nr8 permit is a crucial step forward for the company as the recent IP (induced polarisation) surveys have indicated the mineralisation may extend at depth into this area," Chairman Steve Formica commented.
"The planned drilling will hopefully confirm this, allowing Ragnar to plan further uninterrupted exploration works across the permit boundary," he said.
"With work permits now in place, we are just awaiting the lifting of the COVID-19 travel restrictions before getting on the ground prior to commencing the drilling," he added.
Once travel restrictions have lifted and it is safe to go to Sweden, field validation works, landowner meetings, and inspections can begin.
Ragnar Metals has ended the day 8.33 per cent in the red with shares trading for 0.6 cents each in a $1.880 million market cap.
