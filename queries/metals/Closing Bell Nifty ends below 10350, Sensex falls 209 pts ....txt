Arpit Beriwal, Assistant Manager | Analyst-Technical at Motilal Oswal Financial Services:
Nifty index opened negative in line with weak global cues and drifted towards 10220 mark in initial hour of the session. It consolidated in range of 100 points for most part of the day but witnessed buying interest at lower levels and managed to close above 10300 zones. It formed a small body candle on daily scale as dips are being bought into while hurdles are intact at higher zones. Now, Index has to hold above 10333 zones to witness an up move towards 10500- 10555 zones while on the downside support is seen at 10180 - 10150 zones.
Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities:
Nifty opened lower on the back of weakness in global markets, however, limited sell off in large-cap stocks helped the index recover back in the second half of the trading session. Technically, the market may consolidate between the levels of 10250 and 10450 before seeing any meaningful movements. Avoid buying at the highest point of the range.
Markets usually see volatile swings during the corrective phase and it’s no different this time. We believe the performance of the US markets and India-China border issues are largely dictating our market trend and it’ll continue for some time. Meanwhile, auto sales numbers and PMI data scheduled this week would help investors and traders to assess the recovery in the economy. We reiterate our view to focus on stock selection and trade management.

Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments:
The markets were choppy and failed to move in either direction. We will not be able to see a decisive move if we are unable to cross 10450 or break 10200. It is just the beginning of the July series so traders need to maintain patience and wait for the right opportunity to take a one sided directional trade.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services:
Benchmark indices ended on a negative note, on the back of mixed global cues as surging virus cases around the world and especially in the US, threatened to derail the economic recovery hopes. With states in India set to extend lockdown or reconsidering bringing back lockdown measures, markets seem to be weighing the bad news. As before, uptrend remains intact but the upside may be capped.
Jateen Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst (Commodity & Currency) at LKP Securities:
Rupee ended higher on Monday on likely overseas inflows into local debt amid a weak greenback. Some Jio-related inflows further supported spot pair, however, dollar buying by nationalized banks likely on behalf of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) capped sharp fall in spot pair. Rupee still broadly trading between the range of 75.40-75.75.
