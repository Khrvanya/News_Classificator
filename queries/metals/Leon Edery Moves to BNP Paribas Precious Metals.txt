After a lengthy career at Societe Generale, the precious metals expert is moving to another French bank
The relentless rally in gold this summer has not deterred established industry professionals from looking for new opportunities. Leon J. Edery publicized via his LinkedIn profile that he is moving on from Societe Generale after spending there more than 16 years. He is joining the precious metals sales team at BNP Paribas.
Edery spent the bulk of his career at the Societe Generale’s Paris and London offices. After serving as a manager of the company’s commodities back office for just over four years, he went on to lead the precious metals sales effort of SocGen in EMEA Russia and the CIS regions until December 2010.

His next role, Director of Precious Metals Markets and Sales, was in the London office of the French bank – a position which he held until the end of June 2019. In his new role, Edery will be based in the London office of BNP Paribas.
Precious metals markets have been the most vibrant ones by far in recent trading. Ever since the first signals of a Federal Reserve cut surfaced in June, gold has been on a tear. More recently, silver has joined its big brother and broke out of recent ranges, signaling a protracted market rally, the first one since 2011, when gold topped out just above $1,800.
