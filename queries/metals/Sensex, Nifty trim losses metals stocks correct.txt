The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s Governor Shaktikanta Das briefed the media at 10 am today. RBI further extended the loan repayment moratorium for another three months up to 31 August. The EMI payments will restart only once the moratorium period expires on 31 August.
Das said that the GDP growth in India in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in the negative territory with a pick up in growth impulses in second half. However, these depend on the trajectory of the pandemic.
The RBI also raised the group exposure limit of banks to 30% from 25% for a temporary period till 30 June 2021. Group exposure limit determines the maximum amount a bank can lend to one business house. The central bank relaxed rules governing borrowing by states to help them meet their own liabilities and expenditure requirements. In order to ease the pressures of bond redemption on states, rules governing withdrawal from consolidated sinking fund (CSF) have been eased. CSF is maintained by the state governments with the RBI as a buffer for repayment of their liabilities. This change in withdrawal norms will come into force with immediate effect and will remain valid till 31 March 2021.
RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Friday unanimously decided to slash the Repo Rate by another 40 basis points to 4%. The interest rate decision was taken to revive growth and mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement came following a three-day off-cycle meeting of the MPC, held between 20 and 22 May 2020. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4% within a band of +/-2%, while supporting growth.
The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated, and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress.
The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression. Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood and health are severely affected. Even as various measures initiated by the government and the Reserve Bank of India work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy, it is necessary to ease financial conditions further. This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits. With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdown-related supply disruptions are mended, the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy, even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold.
