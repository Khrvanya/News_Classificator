As optimistic as it sounds, the firm acknowledged that it is a more restrained forecast when compared to some of the more “dramatic” projections other analysts have released over the last few months.
“And a key reason for that is that we would not be surprised to see a period of stabilization or active corrections in the next couple of months,” Webb explained.
However, as 2020 has been a year of much uncertainty, many unknowns still remain — particularly when it comes to gold price motivators for the rest of the year.
A potential coronavirus vaccine or cure could create an outside reaction in markets, the analyst noted.
“Now, even if we are showing restraint there, we certainly entertain the notion that gold prices could continue to move higher beyond 2020, and that’s when some of those levels that others have mentioned might finally be reached,” said Webb.
Metals Focus is calling for a global gold supply decline of 1 percent for 2020, with output from the mining sector expected to decrease by 5 percent.
The greatest drops in production will be seen in South Africa, Peru and China, countries where mines were shut or where work was reduced in compliance with government lockdown orders.
Russia and Australia, which weren’t impacted by COVID-19 mine closures, will see a drop in output due to new mines reaching steady production rates; this will result in flatter production. Mature assets will also make reduced contributions.
Canada and Bulgaria are expected to provide increased output, stemming from the ramp up of projects.
The director of mine supply at Metals Focus pointed out that even for countries where the pandemic didn’t disrupt production, transportation and logistical issues were unavoidable.
