This morning in metals news, MetalMiner has released its July Monthly Metal Buying Outlook, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill and Ford Motor Co.’s second-quarter sales were down 33.3%.
We’re already halfway through what has been a volatile 2020, during which MetalMiner has noted price upticks and monitored a wide range of other developments in our monthly forecasting. You’ll want to pay attention to these and other key areas when reading the July Monthly Metal Buying Outlook:
Steel prices are volatile — and bear close watching as economic recovery efforts continue in China and the U.S.
Inventory levels for a number of metals — and crude oil — are elevated.
Some commodities prices, including copper, have moved past MetalMiner’s resistance levels.
Despite its approval in the Republican-controlled Senate being highly unlikely, the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill, double the size of an infrastructure bill proposed by the House earlier this year.
The bill passed by a vote of 233-188 in the House.
