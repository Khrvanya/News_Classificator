Domestic stock markets are firmly in the green mid way through the day, albeit off the highs touched in early trades, as markets resumed trading after the long weekend.
All the Nifty sectoral indices were trading in the green, with the exception of IT and media.
Domestic stock markets erased intraday gains dragged down by weakness in information technology shares. Earlier in the day, the S&P BSE Sensex index climbed as much as 1.35 per cent - or 414.11 points - to touch 31,086.70, after starting the session up 191.68 points at 30,864.27. The broader NSE Nifty 50 benchmark rose to as high as 9,161.65, having opened higher at 9,099.75 compared to its previous close of 9,039.25. Financials and metal stocks are leading the gains in the markets, while selling pressure in IT counters is capping the upside.
At 2:39 pm, the Sensex traded 89 points - or 0.23 per cent - lower at 30,603 while the Nifty was down 18 points - or 0.19 per cent - at 9,022. Seven of 11 Nifty sectoral indices were trading in the green, with IT, pharma and media indexes being top losers. A total of 37 out of Nifty-50 stocks were trading in the green at the time.
In the Nifty basket of 50 shares, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, Ultratech Cement ITC, IndusInd Bank and Hindalco - trading between 3.77 per cent and 6.48 per cent higher - were the top percentage gainers.
On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, TCS, Hero MotoCorp, HDFC and Zee Entertainment - down between 1.6 per cent and 4.41 per cent - were the top Nifty losers.
Sectorally speaking, the metal sector was going strong, with JSW Steel, Hindalco and Tata Steel gaining between 2.9 per cent to 6 per cent on the NSE.
