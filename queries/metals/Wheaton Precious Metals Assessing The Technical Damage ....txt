Wheaton Precious Metals is down more than 22% in the past ten trading days, taking a much needed rest after a near-parabolic rally.
While the company has been busy selling off, analysts have been hiking their earnings estimates, with FY-2020 annual EPS estimates now sitting at $1.04, from $0.96 previously.
In addition, the stock's valuation is now becoming more palatable, down from the 31x EV/EBITDA multiple the stock carried two weeks ago.
As long as the bulls can defend the $32.90 level on a weekly close, they will remain in control of the bigger picture.
It's been a harsh reality check for investors chasing precious metals stocks higher with abandon in late May, and especially for those bidding up names like Newmont Corporation ( NEM ) and Wheaton Precious Metals
