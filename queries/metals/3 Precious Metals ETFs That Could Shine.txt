There was a time when platinum was the most valuable precious metal, but the metal hasn’t worn that crown in awhile. In fact, both gold and palladium are more valuable than platinum on a per ounce basis. On the bright side for the Aberdeen Standard Physical Platinum Shares, platinum is now viewed as a value play relative to its aforementioned rivals.
Some analysts are tepid on platinum due in part to slack physical demand.
“Platinum should hardly be able to reduce its undervaluation significantly due to the still unfavorable fundamental data,” said Commerzbank. “At best, we expect platinum to perform in line with gold.”
PPLT could offer some upside in the back half of the year, but in order for that to happen, European automobile demand needs to bounce back along with the global economy. If the best platinum can do is perform inline with gold, gold ETFs are the better option because platinum is the more volatile of the two precious metals.
