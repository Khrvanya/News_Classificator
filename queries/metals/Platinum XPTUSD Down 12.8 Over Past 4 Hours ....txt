@MuhammedAsaeed @Taahir_Joosub i don’t really play in that small cap space as it can take you years before you see any rewards.. (they have gone nowhere over the last decade) – look at an implats or a northams if you want to see some shorter term rewards from a spike in the platinum price
In four of the last 6-months the #platinum price has ended the month lower than at the start. What will happen by end-July? @BBGAfrica @Metals @ReutersCommods @ftcommodities @MetalsFocus
