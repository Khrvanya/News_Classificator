The Yauricocha Mine achieved 22% higher throughput in Q1 2020 compared to Q1 2019, despite 15 days lost production realized in March due to the COVID-19 related state of emergency announced by the Peruvian government. Continuing its strong operational performance during Q1 2020, the mine realized a 30% increase in copper equivalent production or a 52% increase in zinc equivalent metal production compared to Q1 2019. The revenues and adjusted EBITDA generated during Q1 2020 allowed the Company to fund its capital expenditure programs, despite a challenging metal price environment. Cash costs per copper equivalent payable pound decreased 7% whereas cash costs per zinc equivalent pound decreased by 20%. AISC per copper equivalent pound increased by 13% whereas AISC per zinc equivalent pound decreased by 4% as compared Q1 2019.
Igor Gonzales, President and CEO of Sierra Metals commented, “Corona had a strong first quarter with strong throughput, an increase in the production of all metals, and a significant increase in copper and zinc equivalent metal production. This occurred despite reductions in throughput and staffing related to the state of emergency declared at the end of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter, the Mine had been running at higher throughput levels building up processed tonnage as a buffer against any potential interruptions. Additionally, we also had a stockpile of ore, which enabled us to continue processing close to capacity at the mill. With that, we reported healthy revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter despite facing much lower metal prices and much higher zinc treatment and refining charges. Yauricocha continues to be a strong performing asset for the Company, and we continue to reap the benefit of prudent investments and operational improvement programs at the Mine.
Looking ahead, we face several uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including implications to production from the work stoppages and the effect of lower metals prices. We maintain an essential services crew at Yauricocha and expect to ramp-up back to normal levels as quickly and efficiently as possible once the suspension is lifted in Peru. I want to remind shareholders that we do have the flexibility at Yauricocha to run the operations at higher throughput levels, which will help us to recover some of the lost production during the remainder of the year. Additionally, we continue to be optimistic that we will still receive the required permits to increase output at Yauricocha to the 3,600 tpd level this year, even though permitting in Peru was placed on hold by the government during the state of emergency.”
He concluded, “Corona continues to have a strong balance sheet and liquidity. We have reduced and deferred capital expenditures to ensure we emerge from the pandemic in a strong position. Once a more normal situation returns, and metal prices improve, we are still poised for strong future production and cash flow growth, and we will continue to make prudent, strategic investments which will benefit all shareholders.”
