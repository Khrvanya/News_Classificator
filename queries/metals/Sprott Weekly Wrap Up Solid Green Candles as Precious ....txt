Toronto, ON / June 19, 2020 / JMN Wire / It’s not how you begin the week, it’s how you end it that matters. And as we head into the weekend, gold prices are nearing their all-time highs, with silver poised for explosive gains.
On this edition of the Weekly Wrap-Up, host Craig Hemke and legendary investor Eric Sprott break down all the gold and silver news you need, including:
“I’d like to start with COVID, because it seems to come in and out of the markets all the time. And we have some of these states where the rate of infection is going up. My own view, and I’ve said it many times now, is it looks to me like the morbidity is nothing like we thought it was. And I really think we have to almost let it run through the system. We’ll see what happens, but life won’t be the same. Which is unfortunate.”
