SINGAPORE, April 21 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Monday, after trading house Glencore said it could reopen mining operations in Zambia, assuaging fears of supply disruptions caused by the coronavirus-led global shutdowns.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 1.2% at $5,123 a tonne, as of 0337 GMT, while the most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) dropped 2% to 41,540 yuan ($5,863.01) a tonne.
Miner Glencore said on Monday it would reverse its coronavirus pandemic-driven decision to shutter its Zambia subsidiary Mopani Copper Mines if it reaches an agreement with the government following its strong objections against Glencore’s decision.
Prices of other base metals also fell, as market sentiment was dampened by the historic drop of U.S. crude oil prices into negative territory overnight.
