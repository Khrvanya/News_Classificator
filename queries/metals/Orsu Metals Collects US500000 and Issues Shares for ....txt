VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / January 6, 2020 / Orsu Metals Corporation (TSXV:OSU) ("Orsu" or the "Company") is pleased to provide the following update:
Orsu has received a payment of US$500,000 related to the 2016 sale of its interest in the Akdjol-Tokhtazan Project located in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Company agreed with the buyers to settle all loans and deferred consideration and to fully release them from any and all other financial obligations in exchange for this settlement payment.
As announced on November 8, 2019, the Company closed a private placement of 4,188,962 special warrants (each, a "Special Warrant") of the Company at a price of $0.265 per Special Warrant to raise C$1,110,075 from two directors of the Company (the "Special Warrant Financing").
Sergei Stefanovich, the Managing Director of the Company, subscribed for C$990,075 of the Special Warrant Financing and Sergey Kurzin, the Executive Chairman of the Company, subscribed for C$120,000 of the Special Warrant Financing. Each Special Warrant is exercisable into one common share of the Company for no additional consideration upon receipt of all approvals.
Mr. Stefanovich currently owns or controls 7,272,158 common shares of the Company representing 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company before the conversion of the Special Warrants.
On December 20, 2019, the Company held a special shareholder meeting at which the disinterested shareholders of the Company approved a change of control resolution to allow Mr. Stefanovich to become a controlling shareholder of Orsu.
On January 2, 2020, the Special Warrants were converted into common shares so that Mr. Stefanovich now owns or controls 11,008,290 common shares of the Company representing 26.1% of the outstanding common shares of the Company.
The common shares are subject to a hold period in Canada expiring on March 9, 2020.
Mr. Stefanovich has a long-term view of the investment and may acquire additional securities either on the open market or through private acquisitions or sell the securities either on the open market or through private dispositions in the future depending on market conditions, reformulation of plans and/or other relevant factors. A copy of the early warning report required to be filed with the applicable securities commissions in connection with the conversion of the Special Warrants will be available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
