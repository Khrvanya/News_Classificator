Here’s our Top 50 small caps for June, but first — a quick recap of 2020, so far.
There were a healthy mix of companies in our January Top 50 . #1 was Singapore-based ‘bottom of the sock drawer’ minnow Netccentric (ASX:NCL) with a 300 per cent gain.
In February, coronavirus-led uncertainty was mounting . This led to numerous potential coronavirus fighters — including any company that mentioned ‘hand sanitiser’– featuring heavily in the top 50. #1 mover was gold explorer De Grey (ASX:DEG) with a 285 per cent gain.
Then came the share market bloodbath in March — a month dominated by COVID-19 bandwagoners, online education and food delivery stocks, and a couple of big nickel discoveries. Our #1 mover was now-suspended COVID-19 test kit spruiker TBG Diagnostics (ASX:TDL) which gained +862 per cent for the month.
April was a month of tentative recovery . The S&P/ASX Emerging Companies Index was up 23.5 per cent, recapturing a big chunk of March’s losses. Gold came to the fore and most of those COVID-19 bandwagoners fell away, but the biggest mover was unremarkable oil and gas company Jupiter Energy (ASX:JPR) with a decidedly remarkable 3650 per cent gain.
By May, gold was number #1 with investors . But money also found its way into early stage uranium explorers like GTI Resources (ASX:GTR) and TNT Mines (ASX:TIN) which were up 231 per cent and 259 per cent, respectively, over the month.
In June economies floundered, markets surged, and gold was king. A massive 51 per cent of the companies on our winners list were gold-focused:

In June, 33 small cap companies posted gains of 100 per cent or more, down from 58 last month. Still, there was plenty of good stories for investors to sink their teeth into.
