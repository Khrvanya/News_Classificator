LIC is the dominant DII on Dalal Street and its total equity investment is projected to top Rs 70,000 crore, an all-time high, this financial year.
Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC ), India’s largest domestic institutional investor, preferred to go with the wind in December quarter, and mostly lapped up largecaps. But it also nibbled at a few midcaps.
The insurance behemoth bought stocks from across sectors – including infrastructure, metals , information technology, ports, NBFC and pharma – during October-December, which saw equity benchmark Sensex surge nearly 7 per cent to 41,253 as of December 31, 2019 from 38,667 on September 30, 2019.
The insurance behemoth, however, offloaded some shares of telecom, power, oil retailers, hospitals, graphite manufacturers and banks.
LIC is the dominant DII on Dalal Street and its total equity investment is projected to top Rs 70,000 crore, an all-time high, this financial year. The insurer invested around Rs 68,620 crore in domestic stocks in FY19. The value of its total equity holding at the end of June quarter, FY20, was estimated at around Rs 6 lakh crore.
Domestic steel firm JSW Steel emerged a favourite of LIC. The company recently reported 4.02 million tonnes of crude steel production for September quarter, up 5 per cent from previous quarter’s 3.84 million tonnes.
Shares of the company is down nearly 7 per cent since January 2019, while Sensex gained 15 per cent. Domestic brokerage ICICIdirect.com is positive on JSW Steel with a price target of Rs 320.
“The stock has seen a base formation over the past eight months near the 80 per cent retracement of the 2017-18 rally. This entire base appears to be forming a rounding bottom, indicating an impending trend reversal, which augurs well for the next leg of up-move,” the brokerage said.
Shareholding pattern of IT firms Infosys and Tech Mahindra showed a rise in LIC shareholding, data from corporate database Ace Equity showed.
Infosys recently posted a 23.7 per cent rise in December quarter’s consolidated net profit at Rs 4,466 crore against the year-ago period’s Rs 3,610 crore.
HDFC Securities maintained a ‘buy’ rating on Infosys post Q3 results with a price target of Rs 850. “Our positive outlook is based on the company’s greater focus on large deals, pricing lever in digital (highest digital growth in tier-1 IT), completion of an accelerated investment phase and improving supply metrics,” the brokerage said.
Tech Mahindra, LIC’s second biggest IT pick of the quarter, is scheduled to announce earnings on January 31.
Among the companies that have reported their shareholding data so far (till January 15), LIC held a stake in nearly 175.
Other major names where LIC upped its stakes during the quarter included Adani Ports, RITES, PowerGrid, Titan, HDFC, TVS Motor, Ultratech Cement, Bosch and Gillette India.
RITES is a wholly-owned government company, engaged in transport consultancy and engineering projects across infrastructure verticals.
Way2Wealth brokers believes RITES can be a value-accretive story for investors focussed on sound management, earnings growth and a clean balance sheet as the government goes about investing some $1.44 trillion on key infrastructure such as roads, railways and metro. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on RITES with a price target of Rs 382.
Another LIC favourite Titan saw ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buy an additional 16.20 lakh shares during the quarter.
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, yet another top LIC bet, on January 3 said it would acquire a controlling stake of 75 per cent of Krishnapatnam Port for around Rs 13,500 crore. Moody's Investors Service later said the acquisition will increase Adani’s market share and diversity.
Global brokerage CLSA on December 9 gave a ‘buy’ rating to Adani Ports with a price target of Rs 485. The scrip traded at Rs 390 on January 15.
LIC also increased stakes in Gillette India, Bosch, Pfizer, Edelweiss Financial Services, Mphasis, Cadila Healthcare, Cummins India and KEC International during the quarter.
On the other hand, the insurance behemoth cut its holding from 11.60 per cent to 10.07 per cent in BHEL from 3.09 per cent to 2.90 per cent in Bharti Airtel, from 3.74 per cent to 3.09 per cent in HPCL, from 7.62 per cent to 7.54 per cent in NHPC and from 9.44 per cent to 9.23 per cent in Axis Bank.
It also trimmed its holdings in Bank of Maharashtra, Apollo Hospitals, ACC, Garden Reach Shipbuilders, Punj Lloyd, Voltas and HEG.
