Kourtney Kardashian loves the keto diet and doesn’t care who disagrees.
The “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” star, 41, took to Instagram and responded to claims that the popular diet is “unhealthy.”
“To the one who said I should let you know that I am not a dietitian, you are correct. Sorry if anyone thought that was my profession,” she wrote.
According to the star, her doctor recommended the eating regimen. “And to all of you saying keto is unhealthy, my Dr. has me do it for brief periods to help detox metals or toxins.”
She added, “And diabetes does run in my family and my dr. also has me check my glucose levels while doing keto for those questioning that too… Thank you all for your concern.”
“Since Kourt is currently back on keto (she likes to practice the high-fat diet to kickstart summer and detox her body), we wanted to share keto-friendly snacks to help curb midday cravings. Though Kourt typically tries her best to avoid snacking while on the restrictive diet, this is what she eats when afternoon hunger hits,” the article reads.
The snacks included frozen blueberries, meats, cheeses and dipping walnuts into an olive dip that is the “bomb.”
Kardashian is known for her healthy lifestyle. The reality star even documents her different diets on “KUWTK”.
