Gold prices held steady on Tuesday as fears over rising coronavirus cases around the world boosted demand for the safe-haven metal. On the other hand, oil prices traded lower after weak Japanese industrial production data, not usually a market-moving factor, was enough to rattle trader nerves over a bumpy recovery in fuel demand.
MCX Gold futures traded 0.12 per cent higher at Rs 48,300 per 10 gram in the early trade, while MCX Crude Oil futures were down 0.30 per cent at Rs 2,991 per barrel.

Oilseeds: Soybean futures (July) are likely to trade sideways in the range of Rs 3,685-3,730 levels. Mustard futures (July) will probably take support near Rs 4,630-4,600 as the demand side is still strong owing to higher offtakes by mills. On the contrary, the upside may remain capped near its previous high of Rs 4,755 levels as Hafed has started selling its procured quantity in the open market through tenders.
