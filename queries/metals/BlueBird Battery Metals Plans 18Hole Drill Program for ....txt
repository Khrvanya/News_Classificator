VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / June 1, 2020 / BlueBird Battery Metals Inc. (TSXV: BATT) (OTC PINK:BBBMF) (the "Company" or "BlueBird") is pleased to announce further details of the planned 2020 drill program on its Canegrass Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project, in Western Australia - the world's top-rated mining jurisdiction[1]. The two-phase program will consist of 18 holes (3,160 m) of Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond (Core) drilling, which will follow up on 2018 successes and begin also test new, high priority areas (Figure 1).
All holes returned anomalous values of Ni, Cu, Co (and PGE) and included some of the highest grades intersected on the project to-date:
BBRC001 (Winx) 14m @ 1.17% Ni, 0.88% Cu and 0.05% Co from 65m, including 1m @ 2.70% Ni, 0.23% Cu and 0.12% Co
BBDD001 (Sunline) 0.57m @ 3.07 % Ni, 0.62% Cu and 0.24% Co from 144.1m
BBDD002 (Tulloch) 14.25m @ 0.69% Ni, 0.82% Cu and 0.05% Co from 243.2, including 4.9m @ 1.33% Ni, 1.26% Cu and 0.10% Co
Downhole electromagnetic (DHEM) testing identified anomalies in holes BBRC001 and 002, BBDD001 and 002, strongly suggesting mineralization is more extensive than intersected
Peter Dickie, President and CEO of Bluebird, commented, "We are excited to commence drilling at Canegrass and anticipate all preliminary on-site activities, as well as permitting, to be completed promptly. Our drilling partner, Newexco, is renowned for methodically planned and executed exploration programs and delivered exceptional results at Canegrass in 2018. Newexco has been instrumental in a number of significant discoveries in Australia and we are pleased to be working with the company for our 2020 program."
The Canegrass Project is emerging as one of the more interesting new layered intrusive nickel projects in Western Australia. The upcoming program will drill untested conductors identified in surface geophysics and continue to assess the extents of the Ni-Cu (Co) mineralization intersected in the previous campaign, including targeting off-hole anomalies.
Drilling will commence with an initial RC programme testing the new anomalies. This will be followed by a diamond drilling programme deepening the RC holes that will target the geophysical anomalies generated from the last campaign and any encouraging geology arising from the RC campaign. The current strike extents of each prospect is unconstrained and down dip/plunge extensions remain to be tested. In order to drill the nickel prospective conductors, the drilling at Winx will have to pass through the vanadium-rich magnetite horizons that initially attracted explorers to the area.

In addition, an EM survey may be conducted over selected areas to evaluate potential new targets.
The planned holes to-date are tabulated below.
