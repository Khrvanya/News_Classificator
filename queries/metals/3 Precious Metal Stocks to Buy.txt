Last year was great for owning risk assets. Yet with more than a few compelling reasons to hedge Wall Street’s enduring and endeared bull market, it’s time to consider a portfolio hedge with precious metal stocks. Today we’ll look at three risk-adjusted plays to profit and smartly diversify.
The historic bull run in equities is running on fumes as we begin 2020. More than a decade since the financial crisis crippled economies and the stock market, investors are partying harder than we’ve seen since 1999.
We know how that played out.
The well-defended rally, which in hindsight became known as the Dot.com bubble, saw even the best and biggest companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) hammered in the aftermath. Of course, today is obviously different than that era’s pricing miscalculation. And for the better. Nonetheless, today’s environment has many of its own risks that shouldn’t be ignored.
The thing is, now and with trillion dollar plus market caps in the rear-view mirror, a dazzling 2019 rally in hand led by dizzying gains in AAPL and MSFT, kicking the tires isn’t unreasonable. Moreover, with frothy market multiples questionably pricing in more good times to come and political instability offered in spades both inside and outside the White House, buying into a low-correlated bull market just underway in precious metal stocks makes total sense.
