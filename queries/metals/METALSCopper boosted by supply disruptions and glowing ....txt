LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Copper climbed to its highest in over five months on better-than-expected factory data from top consumer China and supply disruptions in Chile, the world’s largest miner of the metal.
China’s factory activity last month grew at its fastest level since December, while Chile’s state-owned miner Codelco shut refinery and foundry operations at its Chuquicamata division due to the spread of coronavirus.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose to as high as $6,094 a tonne, a level unseen since Jan. 23. By 1634 GMT, the metal was up 0.6% to $6,054 per tonne.
“The copper market is pricing in a big hit to production in Chile,” said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.
“Chinese demand is the other element, where we have seen high growth recently ... which is evidence of some restocking.”
CHINA RATES: Sentiment was supported by reports that China’s central bank will cut the re-discount and re-lending rates by 25 basis points in a move that will reduce funding costs for smaller firms and rural sectors.
COPPER STOCKS: LME copper stocks MCUSTX-TOTAL hit their three-month low at 213,325 tonnes, while ShFE copper inventories CU-STX-SGH were at their lowest since January 2019 at 99,971 tonnes.
CHINA COPPER: Chinese domestic refined copper prices SMM-CU-REF climbed to 48,910 yuan a tonne, their highest since Jan. 17, but premiums of imported copper into China have been flat for a week. CU-BMPBW-SHMET CU-BPCIF-SHMET
