Comparing the trend in Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) stock over recent months with its trajectory during and after the Great Recession of 2008, we believe that the stock could potentially gain close to 15%-20% once fears surrounding the coronavirus outbreak are abated. Our conclusion is based on our detailed comparison of Commercial Metals’ performance vis-à-vis the S&P 500 in our interactive dashboard analysis 2008 vs. 2020 Crisis Comparison: How Did Commercial Metals Stock Fare During Coronavirus Crisis Compared to S&P 500?
The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency at the end of January in light of the coronavirus spread. Between January 31st and April 17th, Commercial Metals’ stock has lost about 22% of its value (vs. about 11% decline in the S&P 500). A bulk of the decline came after February 20th, when an increasing number of Coronavirus cases outside China fueled concerns of a global economic slowdown. Matters were only made worse by fears of a price war in the oil industry triggered by an increase in oil production by Saudi Arabia. However, the stock partially recovered post mid-March.
Commercial Metals Company, a major producer of steel and related products, saw a major sell-off in its stock in 2020. With almost all major cities being locked down due to the spread of coronavirus, there has been a slowdown in economic and industrial activity. Steel prices, which were already low for a year due to US-China trade tension, saw a further decline in 2020 due to lower steel demand from automobile and construction players. We believe Commercial Metals’ Q1 results will confirm this reality with a major hit to its revenue, coupled with lower guidance for Q2 and full year 2020.
We see Commercial Metals’ stock decreased from levels of around $22 in October 2007 (the pre-crisis peak) to roughly $7 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out) – implying that the stock lost about 67% of its value from its approximate pre-crisis peak. This marked a larger drop in contrast to the broader S&P, which fell by about 51%. However, Commercial Metals’ stock increased at a faster rate post the 2008 crisis to about $11.50 in early 2010 – rising by 57% between March 2009 and January 2010. In comparison, the S&P bounced back by about 48% over the same period.
