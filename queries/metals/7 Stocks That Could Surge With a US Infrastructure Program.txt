The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the Moving Forward Act, the $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill intended to repair or replace much of the country’s crumbling roads, bridges, schools and communications infrastructure. The bill now moves on to the Senate where it is expected to die quietly.
Officially known as H.R. 2, the bill got its start as a once-in-five-years update to federal transportation spending. Known as the highway bill, the spending part of the bill has more than doubled and its page count has ballooned to roughly 2,300.
The president has endorsed an even larger $2 trillion infrastructure spending plan, but details are scarce.
The bill as passed by the House includes nearly $500 billion for the nation’s highways, bridges and transit systems, along with additional funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other authorized spending includes $100 billion for affordable housing, $130 billion for schools, $100 billion to install broadband communications across small-town and rural America, and $70 billion to modernize the country’s electricity grid.
Leaving aside the question of whether the Moving Forward Act or some other version has a chance of being enacted, if by some miracle such a bill should pass, it would create thousands, if not millions, of jobs and provide a giant opportunity for companies in the construction business.
