Used as an alloy due to its high melting point and anti-corrosion.
Out of the Forge and into Tech: Metals for the Future
While these metals help to forge the modern world, there is a new class of metals that are set to create a new future.
Rare Earth elements (REEs) are a group of metals do not rely on their strength, but instead their importance in applications in new technologies, including those used for green energy .
Magnets containing neodymium are used in green technologies such as the manufacture of wind turbines and hybrid cars.
Used in catalytic converters in cars, enabling them to run at high temperatures
This element is used in camera and telescope lenses.
Used to create strong metals for use in aircraft engines.
Used in X-ray and MRI scanning systems, and also in television screens.
Making televisions and computer screens and other devices that have visual displays.
If the world is going to move towards a more sustainable and efficient future, metals—both tough and smart—are going to be critical. Each one will serve a particular purpose to build the infrastructure and technology for the next generation.
Our ability to deploy technology with the right materials will test the world’s mettle to meet the challenges of tomorrow—so choose wisely.
