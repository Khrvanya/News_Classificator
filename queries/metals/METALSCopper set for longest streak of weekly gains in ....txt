BEIJING, July 3 (Reuters) - London copper prices were poised for a seventh consecutive weekly gain on Friday, their longest winning streak in nearly three years, despite a slight easing on the day after top supplier Chile assured traders of a steady output.
Mining giant Chile held its production of copper steady in May versus the previous year even as the coronavirus outbreak exploded in the South American nation.
“The one issue that hangs over all the markets is will we see a surge in secondary infections that will trigger a second wave of national rather than regional shutdowns?” Malcolm Freeman, director of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note.
