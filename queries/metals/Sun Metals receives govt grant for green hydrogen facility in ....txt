Sun Metals zinc refinery in Queensland, Australia.
June 26 (Renewables Now) - Australia's Sun Metals Corporation Pty Ltd has received a AUD-5-million (USD 3.4m/EUR 3.1m) government grant which will fund the construction of a renewable hydrogen facility at its zinc refinery in the Australian state of Queensland.
State Development Minister Kate Jones announced the grant from the AUD-15-million Hydrogen Industry Development Fund on Thursday. It will fund the first renewable hydrogen facility in Northern Queensland, which will be located near Townsville.
Jones said the Hydrogen Industry Development Fund had seen 23 expressions of interest.
"This first phase of our hydrogen project will only be the beginning of developing a substantial renewables hydrogen industry based in Townsville that we hope in the long-term will create export opportunities," Sun Metals' CEO Kiwon Park noted.
The company's zinc refinery supplies a third of its power needs from a 125-MW solar plant that became operational in August 2018.
