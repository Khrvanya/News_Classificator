LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Copper bounced to its highest in about six weeks on Monday as investors hoped that easing of lockdowns and factory restarts would revive metals demand hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Industrial metals prices rose along with stock markets, which also took heart from further stimulus measures announced by Japan.
The Bank of Japan pledged to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds, while in Europe top carmaker Volkswagen resumed work at its biggest factory in Wolfsburg, Germany.
“Chinese factories have been resuming operations and now we have some European plants also resuming operations, so if everything goes to plan and we have seen the peak of the lockdowns, we should have likewise seen the trough in metals demand,” said analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer in Zurich.
But the risk remains that after lockdowns are lifted economies may be slow to recover or even that a second wave of infections could emerge, he added.
“I think there’s a little more upside for the industrial metals, say between 5%-10%, but if you balance that with the big risk which is still out there in the market, I don’t think the metals are very compelling from a risk-reward perspective.”
Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose as much as 2.5% to $5,269 a tonne, its highest since March 17, before paring gains to $5,199 by 1700 GMT, a rise of 1.2%.
