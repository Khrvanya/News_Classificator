Nickel sulphide – critical for the first life forms?
The first living organisms may have relied on nickel and sulphur to obtain energy and sustain themselves. That is the conclusion of a study that shows how nickel sulphide can transform simple chemicals into many of the substances that underpin life. It is one of several recent studies indicating that life-like processes can be kick-started by metals.
“We are able to build up important biomolecules from simple precursors,” says Claudia Huber at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.
