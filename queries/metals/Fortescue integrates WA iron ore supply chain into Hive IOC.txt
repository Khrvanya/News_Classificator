Australian iron ore firm Fortescue Metals Group has officially opened the company’s newly expanded Integrated Operations Centre (IOC) ‘Fortescue Hive’ in Perth, Western Australia (WA).
The IOC uses the latest technology, bringing together the company’s integrated supply chain.
Featuring 162 workstations and 996 computer monitors connected by 64km of underfloor cables, Hive allows Fortescue’s team to work together more closely to deliver improved safety, efficiency and commercial outcomes.
Fortescue Metals Group CEO Elizabeth Gaines said: “The Fortescue Hive seamlessly links our core exploration, metallurgical, mining and marketing expertise to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and the broader community.
“Importantly, the Fortescue Hive will underpin our future use of technology including artificial intelligence and robotics and will expand to include the generation and integrated distribution network for the Pilbara Energy Connect, our hybrid solar-gas power solution.”
The Fortescue Hive facility integrates the iron ore miner’s planning, operations, as well as mine control teams with the port, rail, shipping and marketing teams.
This new space allows 330 team members to work collaboratively 24 hours a day.
