In the face of this week’s headwinds, gold has still climbed 8.2 percent year-to-date and is nearing historic highs, said CPM Group’s Jeffrey Christian during a World Gold Forum presentation .
Describing gold’s movements as a stealth bull market, he explained, “Our estimate is that the average might be US$1,640 to US$1,650. That compares to an annual average of US$1,670 at its peak in 2012.”
Mark Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments, also referenced gold’s historic price action in a Tuesday (April 28) webinar , saying the yellow metal is beginning a steady tick upward.
“Despite the move in gold and gold stocks more recently, it is still very early on when you compare back in history,” he said. “Back the last time that we saw gold and gold stocks rally — back in ’02 all the way up to 2011 — (gold had) a 500 percent 10 year rolling return. Right now, we are at about 40 percent.”
An ounce of gold was trading for US$1,693 at 12:34 p.m. EDT on Friday.
For much of April, silver traded flatly between US$15 per ounce and US$15.40, trapped by declining industrial demand.
Unlike gold, which gained back its mid-March losses, the white metal has been unable to even approach its February high of US$18.60.
That may change as investor demand is projected to grow in the space this year due to renewed safe haven diversification appetite.
