Metal Tiger, the London Stock Exchange AIM listed investor in natural resources opportunities, is pleased to announce that at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) held earlier today, all resolutions placed before the meeting were approved.
Following the approval of Resolution 4 at the AGM, the Company is proceeding with the 1 for 10 Share Consolidation with a record date of 5:00pm today. The 1,522,076,607 Existing Ordinary Shares of 0.01 pence each in issue in the capital of the Company, together with the 3 additional Ordinary Shares to be issued on 30 June 2020 to ensure the Company's issued ordinary share capital is divisible by 10, will be consolidated into 152,207,661 New Ordinary Shares of 0.1 pence each. Such New Ordinary Shares will have the same rights and be subject to the same restrictions (save as to par value) as the Existing Ordinary Shares.
It is expected that the New Ordinary Shares will be admitted to trading on AIM and will be credited to CREST accounts at 8:00am on 1 July 2020 (“Admission”) and that definitive share certificates (where applicable) will be despatched no later than 15 July 2020.
For the purposes of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (“DTRs”), the issued ordinary share capital of Metal Tiger following Admission will consist of 152,207,661 Ordinary Shares with voting rights attached (one vote per Ordinary Share). There are no Ordinary Shares held in treasury. This total voting rights figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine whether they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Metal Tiger under the DTRs.
The New Ordinary Shares will have an ISIN of GB00BNQC0691 and SEDOL BMQC069. The Company’s ticker will remain the same.
The defined terms used in this announcement bear the same meaning as in the Notice of Annual General Meeting, dated 29 May 2020, unless otherwise defined herein.
This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of the market abuse regulation (EU No. 596/2014) (“MAR”).
