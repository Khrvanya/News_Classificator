Cities across the region are seeing protests continue over police brutality, racism, and the death of George Floyd, with plans for more protests this weekend.
Last weekend, police in Syracuse faced off with protesters after some threw objects through the Public Safety Building in downtown Syracuse. Unrest turned into looting of downtown businesses. Since then, though, protests throughout the city, and in other cities in the area, have not led to looting or vandalism seen in other parts of the country.
Spectrum News will provide updates throughout Saturday and Sunday from the front lines of the protests as they develop.
