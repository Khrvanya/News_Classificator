ALBANY — Half of the state’s 10 regions — including the north country and Central New York — were given the green light Thursday to begin Phase III of reopening Friday after metrics were reviewed and cleared by public health officials, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday.
Phase III of the state’s four-phase reopening plan includes restaurants, both indoor and outdoor seating, and professional care services like nail salons and massage studios. These services are able to resume with social distancing guidelines and other restrictions on capacity in place.
The three other regions also entering Phase III on Friday include the Finger Lakes, Southern Tier and Mohawk Valley regions.
“I know businesses are anxious to open, everybody’s anxious to get the economy going, (but) please follow the guidelines and do what is permissible to do,” Gov. Cuomo said during Thursday’s pandemic briefing at the state Capital.
The governor praised the state’s reopening efforts and called attention to New York’s declining rate of new infections.
The state is testing around 50,000 people a day for COVID-19, Gov. Cuomo said, with an average of 1.2 percent of daily tests coming back positive for the virus.
New York City’s average rate of new infections remains higher than in other parts of the state, with around 1.7 percent of tests coming back negative since the city began Phase I of reopening on Monday.
Gov. Cuomo praised his constituents for following the state-mandated guidelines for reopening and noted that new cases continue to drop even as many regions around the state approaches Phase III of reopening.
Gov. Cuomo said the state’s phased reopening is the right approach.
Nearly half of all states, including California, Texas and Florida, have seen COVID-19 cases spike precipitously as they move to reopen businesses and public spaces. Not New York, the governor said.
“All across the country, New York is the outrageous exception,” Gov. Cuomo said.
