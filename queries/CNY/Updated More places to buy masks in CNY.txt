Last week we published a story about where you can purchase face masks locally in Central New York. We got so many responses that we are publishing an updated list to include the new information.
Many of the masks are homemade and not CDC approved. Please check with the vendor to see whether or not their product is approved by the CDC.
Do you know an individual or CNY business that makes masks? Let me know by phone 315-282-8675 or email .
