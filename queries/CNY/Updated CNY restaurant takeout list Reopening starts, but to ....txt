Updated CNY restaurant takeout list: Reopening starts, but to go is still the only way to go
Pickup or delivery is still the only option for Central New York restaurants despite the first phase of reopening.
The reopening — or the Un-PAUSE — has started in Central New York. But for restaurants, takeout via pickup or delivery is still the only way to operate.
Dining rooms likely won’t reopen until at least June, and it’s still not clear what restrictions they will face.
Our takeout list continues to grow. It now includes 390 entries, up from 207 in our first list on March 16.
New additions this week include Jake Hafner’s Tavern in North Syracuse, the Brae Loch Inn in Cazenovia, and The Mission Restaurant and Danzer’s German & American Gasthof in Syracuse.
It’s important to call ahead to be sure the place is open and find its hours and how to place your order. (If ordering, it speeds things up to have your credit card number handy.)
