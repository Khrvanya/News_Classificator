SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - Shanghai nickel prices rose to their highest in nearly six weeks on Monday as major producer Vale trimmed its output forecast of the metal this year, while China’s rate cuts also boosted sentiment.
Brazilian miner Vale SA on Friday cut its 2020 production forecast for nickel to 180,000-195,000 tonnes from 200,000-210,000, excluding its unit in New Caledonia, because of the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The most-traded nickel contract of the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) climbed 4.7% to 102,300 yuan ($14,458.34) a tonne, its highest since March 11, before paring gains slightly to close at 102,030 yuan a tonne, up 4.4%.
Benchmark three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose to $12,420 a tonne, a five-week high, before easing to $12,380 a tonne at 00702 GMT, adding 2.8%.
Vale’s cut underlined concerns over supply shortages after the Philippines, a major nickel producer, shut down some mining activities to curb coronavirus transmission, while demand has picked up slightly as China reopened its economy.
“Nickel’s story is that the Philippines mines are closed. It’s mainly taking reference to ShFE prices, while some arbitrage action is going on to keep those two (LME and ShFE) in line,” a base metal trader said, asking not to be named.
China, the world’s biggest nickel user, on Monday cut its benchmark one-year and five-year loan prime rates to cushion the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, providing some support to prices of the metal used in making stainless steel.
* LEAD: ShFE lead ended down 1.2% to 13,595 yuan a tonne, its lowest close since March 26, and LME lead fell 0.6% to $1,666 a tonne, after weekly ShFE inventories data on Friday showed the pace of lead stocks’ decline has been slowing.
* PRICES: LME copper rose 0.3% to $5,225 a tonne while zinc fell 0.6% to $1,947 a tonne. In Shanghai, copper advanced 0.3% to 42,330 yuan a tonne and zinc rose 0.1% to 16,130 yuan a tonne.
* VALE COPPER: Vale also cut its 2020 output estimates for copper to 360,000-380,000 tonnes from 400,000 tonnes.
* ZINC: Collapsing demand for zinc caused by the novel coronavirus will outweigh the impact of supply cuts from major producers Peru and India this year and leave the market with a surplus that will pressure prices of the material used to galvanise steel.
