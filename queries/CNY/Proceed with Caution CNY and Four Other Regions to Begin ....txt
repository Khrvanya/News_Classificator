In Central New York, phase one of a restart will begin on Friday. Leaders across the region say getting the green light to reopen is an emotional victory.
CNY is one of five regions reopening.
The restart begins at 12:01 a.m. on May 15.
All businesses must follow strict guidelines when reopening.
“Let’s not take the success we’ve had as a community for granted at this point," said Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon. "Let’s just do what we’ve learned. Let’s be smart about it so we don’t go backwards and slow down phase two.”
Governor Andrew Cuomo echoed that sentiment when he gave his daily coronavirus briefing at Upstate Medical University, Thursday. He announced Central New York is the fifth region to meet all of the criteria to begin reopening. The other four are the Finger Lakes, North Country, Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier.
“You're going to say it's a reopening, people are going to say hallelujah, run out of their house, they're going to want to get out, they're going to want to do things," said Cuomo. "Phased opening does not mean the problem has gone away. It means we have controlled the problem because of what we did.”
That restart begins at 12:01 a.m. on Friday. Businesses that can reopen include manufacturing, construction, and agriculture and retail businesses for pickup only. Business owners should use common sense when bringing workers together, Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh said.
“Just because businesses are allowed to reopen doesn’t mean they necessarily should," cautioned Walsh. "Again as you can tell a lot of this information is new. We are getting up to speed so we can help educate other businesses.”
Any business that plans to open must follow a state safety plan, whether it has been open throughout the pandemic or is reopening soon.
