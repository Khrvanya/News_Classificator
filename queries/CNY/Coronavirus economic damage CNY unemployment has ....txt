The unemployment rate in Central New York seems headed to the highest level in 45 years of record-keeping, a Syracuse.com analysis shows.
As the state fought the spread of coronavirus in March, more than 32,000 people in Madison, Oswego and Onondaga counties filed initial unemployment claims.
Add that to the 14,600 people unemployed in February.
That suggests at least 15% of the February workforce is likely out of a job. That more than triples the rate of 4.7% in February.
The number is likely to rise as more businesses shut down and as the state labor department catches up with the hundreds of people in line to file new claims.
A similar estimate of the state jobless rate comes to at least 12% â€” also the worst since it reached 10.2% in 1976.
This graph shows the dramatic spike in the filing of unemployment claims in New York state.
The fullest extent of the fallout will be known Thursday when the New York State Department of Labor releases its March unemployment numbers.
