Call it day one of Phase One: Five regions of upstate New York were given the go-ahead to start a phased re-opening as the state works to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
“We are not racing back into the store, though,” said Showoffs Boutique owner Kellie Williams. “I don’t think our customer is really comfortable with that as of yet.”
Instead, a lot of what the high-end fashions merchant has adapted to during the pandemic will continue at its Armory Square location – curbside pick-ups, free shipping and discounts.
Supporting small and keeping customers safe can be a challenge for re-opening, and Williams said there has been a lot to learn.
“It’s so much information that’s out there, and so much to digest every day,” she said.
True re-opening, Williams says, will take time, so she noted she’s thinking outside the box to return to business, including “pop-up ideas” and private appointments through the summer.
Meanwhile, she said she and her workers will continue to use the skills they honed while the store was closed, making use of their social media feeds to show off their merchandise.
While the business takes it slow, Williams is still dreaming of the future.
“I want that girly element,” she said. “I want to be able to hand you a glass of champagne when we’re allowed to do that again.”
