SHANGHAI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - China stocks started the week higher on Monday, underpinned by fresh hopes for progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks following positive comments from both sides.
** The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.7%, to 3,878.21, while the Shanghai Composite Index also closed up 0.7% at 2,906.17.
** The leaders of the United States and China on Friday underscored their desire to sign an initial trade deal and defuse a 16-month tariff war that has lowered global growth, providing a welcome boost to financial markets.
