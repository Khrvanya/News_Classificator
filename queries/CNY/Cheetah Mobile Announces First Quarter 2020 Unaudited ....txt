BEIJING, June 10, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Cheetah Mobile Inc. (NYSE: CMCM) ("Cheetah Mobile" or the "Company"), a leading mobile internet company with global market coverage, today announced its unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020.
Mr. Sheng Fu, Cheetah Mobile's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "In the first quarter of 2020, we continued to streamline our operations in the mobile Internet business and implement strict cost and expense controls to reduce our losses from the previous quarter. Total cost and expenses decreased by 38.4% year over year and 20.2% sequentially in the quarter. Gross margin grew to 72.0% in the quarter from 66.2% in the same period last year and from 70.2% in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating loss was RMB141 million in the quarter, decreasing from RMB203 million in the previous quarter. Notably, non-GAAP operating profit for our mobile Internet business, namely our utility products and related services and our mobile games businesses, increased to RMB7.8 million in the quarter from a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB91.7 million in the previous quarter. In addition, we continued to execute our AI strategy to rejuvenate our long-term growth. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led to increased number of use cases for our robotics products and solutions in hospitals and public transit while increasing customer awareness for the service at the same time. However, we do not expect our robotics business to generate significant revenues in the near term."
Mr. Thomas Ren, Cheetah Mobile's Chief Financial Officer, commented, "In addition to our improved operating results, we continued to review our investment portfolio and selectively liquidate some of our investments. Recently, we disposed of our remaining equity ownership in Bytedance Ltd., which will result in a gain on investment of approximately US$66 million in the second quarter of 2020. We also continued to return cash to our shareholders. Recently, our Board approved a special cash dividend of US$1.44 per ADS. The aggregate amount of the cash dividends was approximately US$200 million. Importantly, Cheetah Mobile's cash position remains strong, even after paying out this special cash dividend."
Total revenues were RMB528.1 million (US$74.6 million) in the first quarter of 2020, representing a decrease of 51.4% year over year. Excluding the impact resulting from the deconsolidation of LiveMe's revenues, total revenues decreased by 36.4% year over year in the first quarter of 2020.
Revenues from utility products and related services decreased by 57.7% year over year to RMB210.8 million (US$29.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-over decrease was primarily due to (i) a decline in the Company's mobile utility product business in overseas markets, (ii) a decline in the Company's mobile utility product business in the domestic market, and (iii) a decline in PC-related revenues. In the first quarter of 2020, approximately 71.0% of the Company's revenues from its utility products and related services business were generated from advertising while the remaining portion of revenues were generated from other sources, such as anti-virus software sales and office software sales.
Revenues from the Company's mobile utility product business in overseas markets decreased by 62.6% year over year to RMB54.3 million in first quarter of 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the suspension of the Company's advertising collaborations with Google since February 2020. On February 21, 2020, the Company announced that the Company's Google Play Store, Google AdMob, and Google AdManager accounts had been disabled, which adversely affected its ability to attract new users and generate revenue from Google. Revenues from the Company's mobile utility product business in the domestic market decreased by 75.4% year over year to RMB62.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the headwinds in the domestic online advertising market. Our advertising customers that were negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 reduced their budgets on online advertising and marketing, which materially adversely impacted our revenue from online marketing services. PC-related revenues decreased by 5.8% year over year to RMB94.5 million in the first quarter of 2020 as internet traffic in China continued to migrate from PCs to mobile devices.
Revenues from the mobile games business decreased by 5.3% year over year to RMB285.5 million (US$40.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to the suspension of the Company's advertising collaborations with Google since February 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, approximately 69.9% of the Company's revenues from its mobile games business were generated from advertising while the remaining portion of revenues were generated from in-game purchases.
Cost of revenues decreased by 59.7% year over year to RMB147.7 million (US$20.9 million) in the first quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of LiveMe. Non-GAAP cost of revenues decreased by 59.7% year over year to RMB147.6 million (US$20.9 million) in the first quarter of 2020.
Gross profit decreased by 47.1% year over year to RMB380.4 million (US$53.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP gross profit decreased by 47.1% year over year to RMB380.4 million (US$53.7 million) in the first quarter of 2020.
Gross margin was 72.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 66.2% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 72.0% in the first quarter of 2020, compared to 66.2% in the same period last year.

Research and development expenses decreased by 27.6% year over year to RMB142.6 million (US$20.1 million) in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the personnel for the Company's utility products and related services business in overseas markets as well as the deconsolidation of LiveMe. Non-GAAP research and development expenses decreased by 24.7% year over year to RMB135.9 million (US$19.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020.
Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 30.7% year over year to RMB302.8 million (US$42.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was mainly due to the reduction in promotional activities for the Company's utility products and related services business in the domestic market as well as the deconsolidation of LiveMe. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses decreased by 29.9% year over year to RMB304.0 million (US$42.9 million) in the first quarter of 2020.
General and administrative expenses decreased by 16.3% year over year to RMB88.6 million (US$12.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020. This decrease was primarily due to decreased professional fees and share based compensation. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses decreased by 11.5% year over year to RMB87.3 million (US$12.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020.
Operating loss was RMB148.0 million (US$20.9 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to an operating loss of RMB17.7 million in the same period last year.

The Company has reported its operating profit (loss) along the following segments since the second quarter of 2017:
Operating profit for utility products and related services was RMB44.2 million (US$6.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB123.2 million in the same period last year, which was mainly due to the decrease in revenues.
Operating loss for the mobile entertainment business was RMB36.4 million (US$5.1 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB44.1 million in the same period last year, which was mainly attributable to the deconsolidation of LiveMe.
Operating loss for AI and other business was RMB148.9 million (US$21.0 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB70.1 million in the same period last year, mainly due to the increased investments in the Company's AI-related business.
Share-based compensation expenses were RMB6.9 million (US$1.0 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB26.7 million in the same period last year.
Other income, net was RMB42.9 million (US$6.1 million) in the first quarter of 2020, which was primarily due to increases in fair value of certain long-term investments.
Net loss attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders was RMB104.6 million (US$14.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders of RMB7.1 million in the same period last year.
Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders was RMB97.7 million (US$13.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a net income attributable to Cheetah Mobile shareholders of RMB33.8 million in the same period last year.
Diluted loss per ADS was RMB0.76(US$0.11) in the first quarter of 2020, compared to RMB0.02 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS was RMB0.71(US$0.10) in first quarter of 2020, compared to diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.17 in the same period last year.
As of March 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of RMB2,345.1 million (US$331.2 million).
As of March 31, 2020, the Company had a total of 1,393,070,159 Class A and Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding. One ADS represents 10 Class A ordinary shares.
For the second quarter of 2020, the Company expects its total revenues to be between RMB340 million (US$48 million) and RMB390 million (US$55 million). This amount reflects the fact that LiveMe's revenues will no longer be included in the Company's revenues. This forecast reflects Cheetah Mobile's current and preliminary expectation, which assumes the COVID-19 situation would not have any significant unexpected disruption to our operations in the remainder of the second quarter.
