This morning I received a news alert that India would suspend inbound commercial flights. Thus far, India has had relatively few COVID-19 cases. The first cases in the country were from foreign tourists. Limiting air travel is such an obvious way to curtail the spread, but the extent to which passenger air traffic is curtailed varies by country. The WSJ noted in separate articles both the Mexican government’s indifference to the coronavirus and the UK’s decision to allow rock concerts to take place as planned this past weekend. Conversely, Chile and Peru have taken drastic measures. It is easy to Monday morning quarterback this. Despite our study of China, I completely missed the extent to which coronavirus was spreading despite noting more than a month ago that global air travel was still taking place. I am paying for it financially and will do my best efforts to prevent such an error in the future. As we saw during the trade war, we are in a global economy and we need to recognize the consequences the come with that.
