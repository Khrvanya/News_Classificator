Larry Xiangdong Chen, GSX's founder, Chairman and CEO, commented, "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have donated RMB20 million worth of regular winter semester courses to Wuhan residents, delivered free courses of all subjects and all grades to tens of millions of students nationwide, and through our Weishi platform, assisted over 134,000 educational institutions and professionals to transfer offline courses to online. We are proud to have done our part in the fight against the epidemic, even though the aforementioned initiatives weighted down our gross billings and revenues, and added extra costs and expenses in the first quarter. However, we were still able to achieve over 350% year-over-year growth in both net revenues and gross billings. Paid enrollments grew by 307% year-over-year to 774,000, of which a majority were first-time paid enrollments. Moreover, given our high ROI, we expanded investments in customer acquisition and technology development, to lay a solid foundation for our healthy and sustainable growth over the long-term."
Mr. Chen continued, "We were able to achieve this remarkable performance largely thanks to our focus, dedication, and devotion to our strategy, thanks to our continued refining of organizational capabilities, and thanks to our persistent faith in our future. Moving forward, we will remain focused on online live large-class education. We will spare no effort to build a great organization that the best talents yearn for. We will further strengthen our operating efficiency and organizational capability. We will remain committed to hiring and retaining the top-notch teachers and technology professionals. We will strategically expand our investments in high ROI channels to set the stage for long-term growth. We will stick to our profitable growth strategy, as we have always committed to."
Shannon Shen, CFO of GSX, noted, "We delivered impressive results during the quarter despite the challenging environment. Net revenues from our core K-12 business line grew 448% year over year, maintaining the above 400% growth rate we have always had, which demonstrates the enormous value that our highly-focused strategy and persistent execution can generate. Net income for the quarter was RMB148.0 million on a GAAP-basis and RMB190.7 million on a non-GAAP basis, close to the record high we set in the last quarter of 2019. "
Shannon added, "We are proud that we did our best to contribute to the society during the pandemic period. These initiatives shortened the regular enrollment recruitment window, reduced our net revenues and gross billings, and resulted in extra costs and expenses associated with staff compensation, technology support and traffic acquisition. The negative impact on operating profit margin was partially offset by the value-added tax exemption issued by the government, recorded in other income. We were still able to realize net profit margin of 11.4%, and non-GAAP net profit margin of 14.7%, which reflects our proven organizational capabilities and superior operating efficiency. Today, we also announced a share repurchase program, which manifests the management's confidence in our future business prospects. Going forward, we will continually strive to identify, train and cultivate high-quality instructors, enhance the career prospects for tutors, and attract highly-skilled research and technology talents, to generate an efficient and sustainable long-term development."
