Renminbi falls below psychological 7.00 per U.S dollar, its lowest level in 11 years
Aug 05, 2019 (China Knowledge) - China's currency fell past the psychologically important level of RMB 7.00 per U.S. dollar, a record low for the first time in more than a decade. The drop came days after the U.S President Donald Trump announced to slap additional 10% tariffs on RMB 300 bln of Chinese goods.
In early trading today, the Renminbi dropped as much as 1.9% to RMB 7.1087 to per U.S. dollar in Hong Kong, a record low since China allowed the currency to trade offshore in 2010. The Renminbi traded in Mainland China also weakened beyond the level to 7.02 to the dollar for the first time since 2008 when the subprime crisis shocked the global financial markets.
The U.S administration has long accused China of manipulating the Renminbi's value to a lower level to boost exports. If the Renminbi continues to weaken, the depreciation might aggravate the trade dispute between the two countries.
Nevertheless, the PBoC said in a statement that the slide of the renminbi was in response to the U.S's “unilateralism and trade protectionism measures and the imposition of increased tariffs on China”. The central bank states firmly that “PBoC has the experience, confidence, and ability to keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level.”
Stock markets in Asia tumbled this morning due to the fall of the Renminbi. Stock market in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong declined 2% each.
