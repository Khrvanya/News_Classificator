Last week, those scammers swindled two elderly women out of $14,500.
On June 8, a 95-year-old woman from Central Square received a call from someone pretending to be an attorney, police said. The caller said the woman’s grand-daughter had been in an accident and needed $5,500 in cash. The woman sent the money.
On June 10, someone called a 75-year-old woman in Mexico, New York, pretending to be the woman’s daughter-in-law, police said. The caller said she had been arrested and needed $9,000 in cash to pay for legal fees. The woman sent the money.
Police warned people to be on the lookout for similar calls. If you receive a call from an unknown number about a family emergency, try to first contact your grandchild or a family member to confirm the situation is legitimate. If that doesn’t work, ask a question only the grandchild would know, like the name of a favorite pet.
The scammers typically have access to basic information about the person they’re calling and the people they’re impersonating.
“These scammers are skilled enough to obtain the name of the grandchild either through a different phone call or online,” police said. “They can find out the same online personal information about the grandparents.”
If you’ve been victim of a similar incident, contact the New York Attorney General’s office at 1-800-771-7755. You should also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission online at ftc.gov/complaint or by phone at 877-382-4357.
