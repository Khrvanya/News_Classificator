When I sat on my couch for the 22nd day in a row and compiled a bracket of 32 restaurants around Central New York , I knew we’d get some feedback. Food is a passionate topic! I love to cook, and there’s nothing I’m more prideful of than the food I know I cook well and goddamnit if you’re going to tell me it isn’t special in some way.
We got plenty of constructive criticism , some really solid seeding analysis , got that sweet parental approval we all yearn for, and even inspired a competing bracket ! But the vitriol inspired , wow. I’ve been on the butt end of some online beatings , but this was the first time someone called my work trash .
And you know what? Bring it on . We only saw three upsets in the the Round of 32, which is less than most single days of the NCAA Tournament! Sure, your favorite place may be under-seeded, but is there anything more Syracuse than a stuck up dude from a big city giving a CNY establishment a low seed only for them to make a run?
But, for what you all came to see... the Savory 16!
Which restaurant is your favorite?
