A series of invitation only "meet the manager" lunches to discuss how a multi-asset strategy can benefit your clients...and your business.
Delivered online over two half-day sessions (on 7 and 8 September), the Multi-Asset Masterclass 2020 will look to...provide a case for multi-asset investing as well as an outlook for the sector over the year ahead.
The Sustainable Funds to Watch series from Investment Week allows sponsors to show-case up and coming or evolving...funds and managers to some of the most influential fund selectors in the UK. Both Funds to Watch Winter and Funds to Watch Autumn are two day mixed asset class conferences taking place in London. The conferences consist of a mixture of streams including funds under Â£250m, boardroom sessions aimed at more established groups, and quick fire presentations offered to groups by editorial direction.
This event is invitation only.
