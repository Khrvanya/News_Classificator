Syracuse’s Saturday morning low temperature reached 30°. That ties the previous record low from 1966. Saturday’s low of 30° makes five consecutive days with low temperature of 32° or below. This is a record for the month of May in Syracuse, the old record was 4 consecutive days in May 1978.
Other than the cold, it was a snowy start too. Yes, it is May not March although looking and stepping outside this morning you could argue otherwise.
Thank you to our weather watchers for waking up early and submitting your reports.
