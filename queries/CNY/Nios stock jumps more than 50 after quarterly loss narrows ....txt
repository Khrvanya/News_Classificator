Vehicle deliveries totaled 4,799 vehicles, including 4,196 ES6s and 603 ES8s, representing a 35.1% increase from the sequential second quarter. The ES6 is the 5-seater high-performance sport-utility vehicle (SUV), which began deliveries in June, and the ES8 is Nio’s flagship SUV, which began deliveries a year earlier.
