Syracuse, N.Y. -- A wine bar/restaurant tucked into a city neighborhood has joined the list of fine dining spots across Central New York earning honors in a highly regarded ranking of the world’s best restaurants for wine.
Saint Urban Wine Bar & Restaurant, at 124 Dell St. just off Westcott Street, won a coveted “Best of Award of Excellence” for 2020 in the annual rankings by Wine Spectator magazine. It’s Saint Urban’s first time on the list.
Also receiving the”Best of” honor, known as the Two Glass rating, were The Brewster Inn in Cazenovia and The Krebs in Skaneateles.  Both have made the list in the past -- The Brewster since 2009 and The Krebs since 2015.
Nine other Central New York received Wine Spectator’s “Award of Excellence,” or One Glass rating.
The Two Glass rating was given to 1,387 restaurants around the world this year. Honorees in that category typically have wines lists with more than 350 selections. “ ... These restaurants are destinations for serious wine lovers, showing a deep commitment to wine, both in the cellar and through their service team,” the magazine says.
The One Glass rating went to 2,289 restaurants. These wine lists feature at least 90 selections. “Whether compact or extensive, focused or diverse, these lists deliver sufficient choice to satisfy discerning wine lovers,” Wine Spectator said.
No Central New York restaurant earned the Grand Award, or Three Glass rating, which goes to the top 100 wine lists in the world.
