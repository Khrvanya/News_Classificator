Along with the daily Emirates A380 and Qantas services, Air NZ has increased its services to Sydney by seven percent. Virgin still flies between Christchurch and Melbourne and Brisbane.
Virgin Australia said today the airline would also reduce capacity by 2 per cent in the Australian domestic market where it is in a tough fight with Qantas.
It will also cut five aircraft from its fleet.
"Some of today's changes respond to shifting demand on some routes, and others are about refocusing Virgin Australia and Tigerair Australia on the destinations we feel they are best suited," said Scurrah.
Demand for Hong Kong from Melbourne has declined following pro-democracy protests this year and the airline said it was satisfied it could be served through its daily service to the city from Sydney.

The Airbus A330 currently operating the Melbourne-Hong Kong services would be redeployed onto daily Brisbane-Haneda (Japan) flights starting next March. Virgin Australia will also re-enter the Melbourne-Denpasar route from March 29, 2020.
Scurrah said Tigerair Australia would increase its focus on the domestic leisure market and as part of a transition to an all Boeing 737 fleet it would reduce its fleet by two aircraft with the removal of two Airbus A320 aircraft by mid-2020.
Following a review of Virgin Australia's regional airline fleet strategy, three of its Fokker 100 (F100) aircraft will also be retired from the fleet by March next year.
Virgin is not the only Australian-based airline finding the going tough in this country. Jetstar will quit flying on regional routes next month, citing high operating costs and disappointing demand as reasons for the decision.
