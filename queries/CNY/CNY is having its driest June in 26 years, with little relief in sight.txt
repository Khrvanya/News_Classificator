Syracuse, N.Y. — Central New York is enduring its driest June in 26 years, and there’s little substantial rain in the forecast.
So far this month, just 0.3 inches of rain has fallen at Hancock International Airport, the official Syracuse measuring station. That’s the lowest June 1 to 17 total since 1994. Normal is about 2 inches.
The first 17 days of June have been the seventh-driest since records began in 1903.
About a third of New York is considered abnormally dry in today’s U.S. Drought Monitor report, but that definition doesn’t include Central New York. The Adirondacks, North Country, Capital Region and Upper Hudson Valley are considered abnormally dry.
Soil moisture, an important measure for farmers and gardeners, is about normal , according to the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center.
There is no widespread, soaking rain in the forecast for the next seven days for Central New York. There are small chances for hit-and-miss thunderstorms through Sunday that could drench isolated spots while leaving the rest of us dry.
The average temperature so far this month is about normal. That included a 90-degree afternoon on June 10 and a 42-degree morning four days later, the latter setting a low temperature record .
Since Jan. 1, precipitation — rain and the water in snow — have been about normal in Central New York.
