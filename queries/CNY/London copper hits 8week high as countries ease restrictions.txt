SINGAPORE — London copper hit its highest in eight weeks on Monday on hopes of better demand for metals as certain countries started to ease lockdowns that were enforced to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
Australia, France and Spain are slowly opening their economies, while the United Kingdom – which has the second-highest virus death toll in the world – introduced some limited easing of restrictions.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose as much as 1.8% to $5,370 a tonne, its highest since March 16, before easing slightly to trade 1.2% higher at $5,274 a tonne by 0524 GMT.
The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) advanced 1% to 43,750 yuan ($6,179.20) a tonne.
However, analysts said copper prices would remain pressured for the rest of the year given the risks of a second wave of infections in some countries, including China, the world’s biggest consumer of the red metal.
“If there is no follow through buying from Europe and the United States, it could well mean a fall back from these levels,” said Malcolm Freeman, a director at Kingdom Futures.
The head of the International Monetary Fund on Friday signaled a possible downward revision of global economic forecasts.
Fitch Solutions saw a surplus of 344,000 tonnes of copper globally this year and another surplus of 162,000 tonnes in 2021, compared with a deficit of 63,000 tonnes in 2019, it said in a note.
LME aluminum rose 0.9% to $1,498 a tonne and zinc climbed 1% to $2,023.50 a tonne.
ShFE aluminum rallied 1.2% to 12,555 yuan a tonne, nickel advanced 0.4% to 102,150 yuan a tonne and tin climbed 1.2% to 131,150 yuan a tonne.
