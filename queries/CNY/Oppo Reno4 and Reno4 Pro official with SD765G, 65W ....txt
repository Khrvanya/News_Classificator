Oppo introduced its Reno series back in April of last year and the line quickly filled its ranks. The latest members are the Reno4 and Reno4 Pro and they bring OLED displays, Snapdragon 765G chipsets and capable camera setups.

The vanilla model settles for a 6.4-inch panel but comes with a dual punch-hole cutout with the same 32MP selfie cam backed by a 2MP depth helper.
Around the back, the Reno4 gets a 48MP main shooter alongside an 8MP ultrawide snapper and a 2MP depth helper. The Reno4 Pro steps up the ultrawide cam to 12MP and also comes with a 13MP telephoto module capable 5x hybrid optical and 20x digital zoom.
Oppo is including its Live HDR video which promises better detail preservation and color accuracy, especially in low light scenarios.
