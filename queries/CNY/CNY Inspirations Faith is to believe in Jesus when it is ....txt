Many Christians say that they believe in God. When things are going well, we are quick to trust that God can resolve our problems. However, when things seem impossible, we hesitate to stand firm in the faith that God will resolve our problems.
When Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was sick, Jesus told them, “This sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God.” However, when Jesus arrived three days later, Lazarus had died. The thing is that Lazarus was also dead inside of the hearts of Mary and Martha. That is why they could not accept the words of Jesus when He said, “Thy brother shall rise again.”
Just because something is impossible to us does not mean it’s impossible for Jesus. That is why faith is believing in Jesus when it is impossible.
