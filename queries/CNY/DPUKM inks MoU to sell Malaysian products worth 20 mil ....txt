CHANGSHA (China) (Nov 16): The Malaysian Small Entrepreneurs Chamber of Commerce (DPUKM) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with one of China's leading hypermarkets, E-Fresh Food Corporation Ltd, for the sale of 20 million renminbi (about RM12 million) worth of products from Malaysia every month.
DPUKM president Datuk Seri Abu Hasan Mohd Nor said the MoU would enable a range of Malaysian products to enter the China market through E-Fresh outlets.
"We hope the cooperation with E-Fresh would spur the introduction of more Malaysian products in the country," he told reporters after the MoU signing at the 2019 One Town One Product International Commodity Fair (OTOP) here.
It was signed by E-Fresh chairman Arthur Pan and Abu Hasan, witnessed by Tekun Nasional deputy chief executive officer (management and corporate) Roshaimi Harun.
Abu Hasan said under the MoU, 200 types of Malaysian products from 20 companies will enter China every month.
Pan said: “We have chosen Malaysian-made products especially durian-based food products, beverages and others because many people in China find them interesting, easy to prepare and appetising.”
He said in December, a group of Malaysian entrepreneurs will be brought to E-Fresh’s newest outlet in Wenzhou to see E-Fresh’s marketing operations.
Some 2,000 entrepreneurs and exhibitors from around the world are taking part in the fair being held at the Changsha International Convention and Exhibition Centre from Nov 15 to 19.
