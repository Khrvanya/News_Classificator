“We kicked off 2020 with an outstanding first quarter fueled by strong results across the full spectrum of our business, despite challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic," said Mr. William Huang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Our net additional total area committed was over 22,000 sqm during the quarter, carrying on the strong momentum from 2019. Our data center capacity expanded by approximately 25,000 sqm, with the addition of major new projects in the Beijing and Shanghai markets. Most important of all, we kept up our record of zero infections across our workforce and zero interruptions to customer operations. We are confident of our ability to continue satisfying the unprecedented demand for data center services in the digital era.”
“Our sustained growth performance in the first quarter of 2020, with 39.1% revenue and 49.3% adjusted EBITDA growth, clearly demonstrates the resilience of our business,” commented Mr. Dan Newman, Chief Financial Officer. “Our adjusted EBITDA margin hit a new high of 46.1% during the quarter, increasing by 3.1 percentage points compared with the same period last year. We remain strongly capitalized for the opportunities in front of us.”
Net revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB1,240.4 million (US$175.2 million), a 39.1% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB891.8 million and a 5.2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB1,179.2 million. Service revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB1,232.6 million (US$174.1 million), a 38.3% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB890.9 million and a 6.3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB1,159.6 million. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to full quarter revenue contribution from additional area utilized in the previous quarter and the contribution from 7,816 sqm of net additional area utilized in the first quarter of 2020 which mainly related to the Shanghai 6 (“SH6”), Guangzhou 3 (“GZ3”) Phase 2, Beijing 6 (“BJ6”), and Langfang 1 (“LF1”) data centers. Revenue from IT equipment sales was RMB7.8 million (US$1.1 million), compared with RMB0.9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and RMB19.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Cost of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB890.1 million (US$125.7 million), a 30.9% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB679.8 million and a 0.6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB884.5 million. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to an increase in power consumption as a result of higher area utilized, partially offset by lower unit power costs as a result of government concessions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase in rental, personnel and other costs related to new data centers coming into service in the previous quarter, namely Shenzhen 6 (“SZ6”), BJ6, LF1, Guangzhou 6 (“GZ6”) and Beijing 9 (“BJ9”), and in the first quarter of 2020, namely Zhangbei 4 (“ZB4”). These increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization costs also due to certain government concessions which reduced our finance lease costs, and by a lower level of IT equipment cost due to a lower level of IT equipment sales.
Gross profit was RMB350.3 million (US$49.5 million) in the first quarter of 2020, a 65.2% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB212.0 million, and an 18.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB294.7 million. Gross profit margin was 28.2% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with 23.8% in the first quarter of 2019, and 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in gross profit margin over the previous quarter was primarily due to lower unit power costs, lower depreciation and amortization costs, and less low-margin IT equipment sales.
Adjusted Net Operating Income (“Adjusted NOI”) (non-GAAP) is defined as net loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding net interest expenses, income tax expenses (benefits), depreciation and amortization, operating lease cost relating to prepaid land use rights, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs, share-based compensation expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, foreign currency exchange loss (gain) and others. Adjusted NOI was RMB664.9 million (US$93.9 million) in the first quarter of 2020, a 45.4% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB457.3 million and an 8.4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB613.1 million.
Adjusted NOI margin (non-GAAP) was 53.6% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with 51.3% in the first quarter of 2019, and 52.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to lower unit power costs and less low-margin IT equipment sales.
Selling and marketing expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB13.2 million (US$1.9 million), were RMB17.1 million (US$2.4 million) in the first quarter of 2020, a 16.1% decrease from the first quarter of 2019 of RMB20.3 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB7.5 million) and a 32.3% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB25.2 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB14.5 million). The decrease over the previous quarter was primarily due to a reduced level of marketing activities and travel expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
General and administrative expenses, excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB35.9 million (US$5.1 million), depreciation and amortization expenses of RMB21.9 million (US$3.1 million), and operating lease cost relating to prepaid land use rights of RMB0.5 million (US$70 thousand), were RMB58.8 million (US$8.3 million) in the first quarter of 2020, a 2.9% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB57.1 million (excluding share-based compensation expenses of RMB16.6 million and depreciation, amortization expenses of RMB16.7 million) and an 1.7% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB59.8 million (excluding share-based compensation of RMB42.5 million and depreciation, amortization expenses of RMB18.6 million). The decrease over the previous quarter was primarily due to lower personnel costs and a decrease in other corporate expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research and development costs were RMB8.7 million (US$1.2 million) in the first quarter of 2020, compared with RMB4.6 million in the first quarter 2019 and RMB6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Net interest expenses for the first quarter of 2020 were RMB260.9 million (US$36.8 million), a 19.1% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB219.1 million and an 11.7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB233.6 million. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due to higher total gross debt balance to finance data center capacity expansion.
Foreign currency exchange loss for the first quarter of 2020 was RMB12.6 million (US$1.8 million), compared with a gain of RMB4.8 million in the first quarter of 2019 and a loss of RMB0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Net loss in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB92.0 million (US$13.0 million), compared with a net loss of RMB136.6 million in the first quarter of 2019 and a net loss of RMB103.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) is defined as net loss excluding net interest expenses, income tax expenses (benefits), depreciation and amortization, operating lease cost relating to prepaid land use rights, accretion expenses for asset retirement costs and share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was RMB572.1 million (US$80.8 million) in the first quarter of 2020, a 49.3% increase over the first quarter of 2019 of RMB383.2 million and an 8.2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019 of RMB528.7 million.
Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) was 46.1% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with 43.0% in the first quarter of 2019, and 44.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase over the previous quarter was mainly due lower unit power costs, less low-margin IT equipment sales, and a reduced level of corporate expenses, partially offset by a negative impact from the foreign currency exchange loss.
Basic and diluted loss per ordinary share in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB0.09 (US$0.01), compared with RMB0.15 in the first quarter of 2019, and RMB0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Basic and diluted loss per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) in the first quarter of 2020 was RMB0.71 (US$0.10), compared with RMB1.21 in the first quarter of 2019, and RMB0.82 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares.
Total area committed at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 286,990 sqm, compared with 199,831 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 264,878 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 43.6% Y-o-Y and 8.3% quarter-over-quarter (“Q-o-Q”), respectively. In the first quarter of 2020, net additional total area committed was 22,112 sqm, including significant contributions from the Shanghai 13 (“SH13”), Shanghai 14 (“SH14”), Langfang 2 (“LF2”) and Langfang 4 (“LF4”) data centers. The sales increase was driven primarily by booming Cloud adoption in China leading to higher demand from Cloud service providers, as well as significant new commitments from large Internet customers.
Area in service at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 229,986 sqm, compared with 171,515 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 225,963 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 34.1% Y-o-Y and 1.8% Q-o-Q. In the first quarter of 2020, net additional area in service was 4,023 sqm, mainly due to the ZB4 data center coming into service.
Area under construction at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 110,706 sqm, compared with 65,736 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 89,834 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 68.4% Y-o-Y and 23.2% Q-o-Q, respectively. In the first quarter of 2020, construction commenced on the SH14 and LF4 data centers.
As previously disclosed, SH14 is an existing building we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019, located in the same area as our Waigaoqiao data center cluster. It will yield a net floor area of approximately 11,040 sqm, and was 63.4% pre-committed at the end of 1Q20. SH14 is expected to come into service in late 2020.
LF4 is the first building of two on our Langfang Site 1 Phase 2, adjacent to our Langfang 3 (“LF3”) data center which is currently being developed on Langfang Site 1 Phase 1. As previously disclosed, we entered into a framework agreement with the local government for the allocation of power and acquisition in phases of a greenfield site (“Langfang Site 1”), with a total land area of approximately 127,000 sqm, in Langfang, Hebei province. In the third quarter of 2019, we completed the acquisition of the first phase of this greenfield site, where we are currently developing LF3. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired the second phase, with a land area of approximately 44,000 sqm. We intend developing two data centers on this land, LF4 and Langfang 5, with a net floor area of around 29,000 sqm in aggregate according to the initial design. LF4, currently under construction, will yield a net floor area of approximately 14,832 sqm and was 50% pre-committed at the end of 1Q20. LF4 is expected to come into service in 2021.
Commitment rate of area in service was 91.9% at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with 96.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 91.9% at the end of fourth quarter 2019. Pre-commitment rate of area under construction was 68.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with 53.4% at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 63.6% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.
Area utilized at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 163,838 sqm, compared with 118,050 sqm at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 156,022 sqm at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 38.8% Y-o-Y and 5.0% Q-o-Q. Net additional area utilized was 7,816 sqm in the first quarter, which mainly came from additional area utilized in the SH6, GZ3 Phase 2, BJ6, and LF1 data centers.
Utilization rate of area in service was 71.2% at the end of the first quarter of 2020, compared with 68.8% at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and 69.0% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.
During the first quarter of 2020, we acquired the following land and buildings:
In March 2020, we acquired a site in Pujiang Area, Minhang District of Shanghai, located around 25 kilometers from our existing data center cluster in Waigaoqiao, Shanghai, from a third party for a cash consideration of RMB1.37 billion (US$193.5 million). Minhang District is an established data center hub due to its proximity to submarine cable landing stations. It is an attractive location for enterprise customers, while the site’s large developable area is also well-suited to the requirements of hyperscale customers. The site has a total ground area of approximately 212,000 sqm, roughly half of which is developed and half greenfield. We intend using the site for a major new data center campus, to be developed in multiple phases over several years.
In the first phase of development, we intend to convert two existing buildings into data centers (to be known as “SH16” and “SH17”), which will yield a total net floor area of approximately 22,600 sqm according to the initial design. Construction of SH16 and SH17 is expected to commence in 2Q20. Access to power has been obtained for Phase 1, while development of subsequent phases, with roughly 50,000 sqm of potential total net floor area, will be contingent on obtaining additional power capacity.
In February 2020, we acquired the right of use for greenfield land with a ground area of approximately 49,000 sqm in the city of Chongqing from the local government for a consideration of RMB28.0 million (US$4.0 million) pursuant to a binding framework agreement that we entered into with the local government in August 2018 and August 2019, respectively. Once developed, it will yield a total net floor area of approximately 33,000 sqm according to the initial design. Chongqing is a primary economic hub in the West of China, along with Chengdu. With customer demand gradually emerging in the Chongqing market, we believe it will become a new Tier 1 market in terms of data center demand in the near future.
As of March 31, 2020, cash was RMB3,611.1 million (US$510.0 million). Total short-term debt was RMB1,668.1 million (US$235.6 million), comprised of short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings of RMB1,407.0 million (US$198.7 million) and the current portion of finance lease and other financing obligations of RMB261.1 million (US$36.9 million). Total long-term debt was RMB15,200.1 million (US$2,146.7 million), comprised of long-term borrowings (excluding current portion) of RMB8,059.4 million (US$1,138.2 million), convertible bonds of RMB2,084.7 million (US$294.4 million) and the non-current portion of finance lease and other financing obligations of RMB5,055.9 million (US$714.0 million). During the first quarter of 2020, the Company obtained new debt financing and re-financing facilities of RMB485.0 million (US$68.5 million).
The Company confirms that the previously provided guidance for total revenues of RMB5,510 – RMB5,750 million, adjusted EBITDA of RMB2,550 – RMB2,670 million and capital expenditures of RMB7,500 million for the full year of 2020 remains unchanged.
This forecast reflects the Company’s preliminary view based on the current business situation and market conditions. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting business disruption in many aspects of the Chinese and global economy, this forecast remains uncertain and subject to change. While China appears to be on a path to recovery, the situation is evolving, and we are closely monitoring developments. Looking beyond the current period, we are confident that GDS will emerge stronger, with even greater opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth.
