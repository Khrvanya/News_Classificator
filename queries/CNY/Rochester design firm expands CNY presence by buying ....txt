SYRACUSE — LaBella Associates has acquired Harmony Architectural Associates, PC, of Syracuse in a deal that expands LaBella’s presence in the region.
LaBella Associates on June 25 announced it had completed the acquisition. It is a design firm that is headquartered in Rochester with an existing office in Syracuse.
LaBella did not release any financial terms of its acquisition agreement with Harmony.
Harmony’s six employees will begin operating under the LaBella name and brand “immediately.” Harmony currently operates at 1860 Erie Boulevard East in Syracuse. The employees will join LaBella’s Syracuse–based staff of nine at its Armory Square office later this summer.
LaBella has operated a Syracuse–based office since 2014. Launched in 1978, LaBella has more than 850 employees across more than 22 offices.
During the firm’s history, Harmony also functioned as a design-build firm.
“In collaborating with LaBella, we found alignment in our approach to both projects and company culture,” Bill Ferraldo, a principal with Harmony Architectural Associates, said in a release. “LaBella’s core values — including an emphasis on creating partnership with employees, clients, and our community — has resulted in a highly respected brand that we are thrilled to join.”
