China stocks up 5th week on stimulus, trade optimism
SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - China stocks slipped on Friday, but finished the first week of a new decade higher with a five-week winning streak as Beijing eased monetary policy to shore up the economy even as investors cheered a thaw in Sino-U.S. trade tensions.
** The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 0.2% to 4,144.96, while the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.1% to 3,083.79.
