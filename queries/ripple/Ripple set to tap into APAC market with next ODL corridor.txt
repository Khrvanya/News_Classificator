Cryptocurrency payments company Ripple looks set to expand its remittance service to Asia Pacific (APAC) region with Japan and South Korea being next on the cards.
According to XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) tracker, a transaction has been processed on Bithumb with Korean Won being displayed as the source of fiat currency.
The recipient was Japanese exchange Bitbank, who received the funds in Japanese Yen to intensify speculation of potential development in APAC.
On-Demand Liquidity is Ripple’s remittance service that allows users to transact across multiple corridors, with the US-Mexico corridor being reported on by Coin Rivet last week.
In November it was reported that remittance firm RBI Remit had announced the launch of the first-ever blockchain-based money transfer service between Japan and Vietnam.
RBI Remit is section of RBI Ripple Asia, which has been a collaborative project between Ripple Labs and SBI Holdings since May 2016.
