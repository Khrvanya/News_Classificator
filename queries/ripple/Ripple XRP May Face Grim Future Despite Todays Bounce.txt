Earlier this past week Ripple (XRP) along with the aggregated crypto markets faced an incredibly sharp sell-off that sent XRP reeling down to lows of $0.25, which marked a significant pullback from the mid-$0.30 region where it has previously found stability.
Although the crypto was able to post a small bounce today, analysts are still noting that XRP broke below its 2018 support level, which could mean that significantly further losses are imminent.
At the time of writing, Ripple is trading up just over 1% at its current price of $0.265, which marks a slight increase from its daily lows of just below $0.26.

This past Wednesday, XRP incurred a significant influx of selling pressure that sent its price reeling down from over $0.30 to lows of roughly $0.25, at which point it found some strong support that allowed it to climb slightly higher.
It now appears that the $0.25 region is a strong level of support, as it has bounced each time that it has visited this region.
Importantly, unlike many other major altcoins, XRP is currently trading below its 2018 lows, and has now set a fresh low since it first began its downwards ascent from highs of nearly $4.00 in early-January of 2018.

Will XRP Drop Further in Near-Future?
Although analysts are not sure what has been the root cause behind Ripple‚Äôs lackluster price action throughout 2019, some investors have pinned it on regulatory concerns regarding its potential status as a securities product, which others have linked it to Ripple ‚Äì the FinTech company closely associated with XRP ‚Äì offloading massive amount of XRP onto the markets each quarter.
Regardless of what the cause might be, The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, noted in a recent tweet that the recent drop marked a break below its 2018 support level, which could mean further losses are imminent.
‚Äú$XRP: Relieved I sold last week! üôÇ Support from August 2018 has now broken. However, I am adding some here as we potentially have a falling wedge here. Breakout would test previous support,‚Äù she explained while referencing the below chart.

As the week wraps up, it is unclear as to whether or not Bitcoin‚Äôs price action will guide that of Ripple‚Äôs, or if the crypto will operate on an individual basis as it continues to face intense selling pressure.
