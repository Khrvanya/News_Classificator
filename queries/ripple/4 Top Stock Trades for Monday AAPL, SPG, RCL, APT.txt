4 Top Stock Trades for Monday: AAPL, SPG, RCL, APT

Quad witching day , one of four each year, pulled the rug out from under a lot of traders on Friday. On Thursday we warned about the potential headaches it would cause and we’re seeing it play out today. Let’s look at a few top stock trades for next week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Apple (AAPL)
Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) shares turned lower on the day after the company announced it would close its retail locations in several states getting hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus.
This created a ripple effect — as we’ll discuss in a moment — as Apple was one of the first retailers to close down earlier this year due to Covid-19.
Look, this stock has been very resilient, pushing through its prior highs earlier this month and racing all the way over $350. Shares could not sustain above the 123.6% extension from the March low to the February high, which came into play at $353.31.
Now, pulling back, I want to see if uptrend support (blue line) holds as support. Falling below that puts the 20-day moving average in play. A dip below that puts the $325 breakout level on the table.
