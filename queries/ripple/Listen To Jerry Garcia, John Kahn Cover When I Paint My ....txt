Listen To Jerry Garcia, John Kahn Cover “When I Paint My Masterpiece” From ‘GarciaLive Vol. 14’ [Audio]
The latest single from the upcoming GarciaLive release is available now, and features Jerry Garcia and John Kahn covering Bob Dylan‘s “When I Paint My Masterpiece”. As previously announced, GarciaLive Volume 14 will contain Garcia and Kahn’s entire January 27th, 1986 acoustic performance at The Ritz in New York, NY.
The release of “When I Paint My Masterpiece” follows a live cut of “Ripple”, which was put out alongside the GarciaLive Volume 14 announcement last month.
This rendition finds Garcia taking vocals on a song the Grateful Dead would begin covering the following year, but with Bob Weir taking vocals. This time, Garcia takes the reins on the song that was written by Dylan and originally released on The Band‘s 1971 album Cahoots. While Garcia’s performances with the Dead from this era aren’t exactly heralded as the best, there’s a certain charm in Garcia’s raspy, beleaguered voice that fits perfectly with the acoustic template from him and Kahn.

The simplicity of Garcia’s acoustic guitar, alongside Kahn’s upright bass, gives the song a unique sound that distinguishes it from any rendition the Dead ever performed. While this show highlights some fine playing by Garcia, things would soon take a turn for the worse for the beloved guitarist. On July 10th, Garcia would slip into a diabetic coma that would force the Dead off the road until December 15th, and in the ensuing period, Jerry was forced to re-learn the guitar.
