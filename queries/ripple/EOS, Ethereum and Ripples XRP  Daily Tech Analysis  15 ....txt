EOS would need to move back through to $2.00 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.0949 back into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from the morning high $2.0065.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the first major resistance level at $2.0949 would likely cap any upside.
Failure to move back through to $2.00 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall back through the morning low to sub-$1.9550 levels would bring the first major support level at $1.9032 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer well clear of the second major support level at $1.8292.

A fall back through the morning low $120.00 would bring the first major support level at $116.66 into play.
