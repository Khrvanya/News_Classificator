Lil Sarah Bee Farm joins the line up of vendors at the Yadkin Farmers Market.
If peaches, apples, and strawberries don’t cure your sweet tooth – how about local honey? Lil’ Sarah’s Bee Farm is joining the vendor lineup at the Yadkin Farmers Market.
Lil Sarah’s Bee Farm in Tobaccoville is a stone’s throw from the Yadkin River. Honey does not get more local than that. Owners Bob and Sarah Mathis have beehives on site and sell honey out of their home. The farm is named after their granddaughter, Lil Sarah. Now 18 years old, she is involved in the bee business, and will attend Appalachian State in the fall.
Lil Sarah’s Bee Farm has seasonal offerings of wildflower and sourwood honey, honey in the comb, bee pollen and more. Their products are sold widely at farmers markets and honey festivals. They have a reputation for high-quality, pristine, and flavorful honey.
Find Sarah and Lil Sarah at the Yadkin Farmers market on Saturday, June 20, and periodically throughout the season. When you stop by their table, they won’t just sell you honey. They will tell you about their bees, the health benefits of honey and how to use it for allergies and other ailments.
