EOS fell through the first major resistance level at $2.5924 before striking a late morning intraday high $2.6633.

EOS would need to move through to $2.66 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.6864 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from Tuesday’s high $2.6633.
Barring an extended crypto rally, however, the major first resistance level would likely cap any upside.
Failure to move back through to $2.66 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall through the morning low to sub-$2.6285 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.5936 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of the second major support level at $2.5357.

A fall back through the morning low to sub-$213.30 levels would bring the first major support level at $210.67 into play.
