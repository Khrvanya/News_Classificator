Myrtle Ripple 1926–2020 Northfield—Myrtle "Myrt" Ripple, age 93 of Northfield, passed away Thursday, June 18, 2020, at Northfield Hospital Long Term Care. Myrt was born on September 7, 1926, the daughter of Stanley and Lena (Koester) Ripple on the family farm in Bridgewater Township. This would be the only home Myrt would ever know. She attended country school and helped on the family farm while growing up. She graduated from Northfield High School in 1944 and later worked for a company located in the Twin Cities, but she worked from her home knitting ski wear, hats, gloves with her knitting machine. Myrt enjoyed quilting, crafting, and in her earlier years, traveling with her mother and cousins, Florence and Edna, taking trips to the East Coast, the Ozarks, Branson, Missouri, and out West by way of Amtrak to Seattle and Vancouver. Myrt knew something about everything. She was a very smart lady and not one to be considered an introvert. She had a good life. A happy life and would do anything for anyone. Not having children of her own, Myrt loved the company of her nephews and nieces. She is survived by her brother Jerald (Rosie) Ripple of Tulsa, OK. She was preceded in death by her parents and a sister Grace Lien. Graveside services will be at Northfield Cemetery, located across from Bierman Funeral Home, 1316 Division St S, on Friday, June 25, 2020, at 2:00 PM. biermanfuneralhome.com .
