Ripple, Brave, Huobi and 40 other companies have joined the Open Payment Coalition to launch instant payment network PayID worldwide.
More than 40 companies including Ripple, Brave and Huobi have joined forces to form the Open Payments Coalition and launch universal payments system PayID.

Users can provide an email address or a phone number linked to their bank account to instantly receive money without requiring complicated bank account numbers, international codes, routing numbers or SWIFT IDs.
