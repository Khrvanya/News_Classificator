Ripple’s Success as a Payment Company May Not Benefit XRP, Says Pompliano
Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano is a strong supporter of Ripple as a payment protocol company.
Pomp remains unconvinced whether Ripple's success will ultimately benefit XRP as an asset for investment.
Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano believes that Ripple’s success as a payment protocol may not benefit XRP in the long run.
Speaking on the latest episode of The Pomp Podcast , Pompliano outlined his reasons for being a fan of Ripple. According to Pomp, Ripple excels as a blockchain-based payment company that has managed to forge relationships with banks and financial services across the globe.
However, Pompliano remains unconvinced of whether Ripple’s overall success will translate into benefits for XRP.
What I don’t understand, and I think where I choose to not engage on the XRP side, is I don’t understand why people are buying it, speculating on future price movements.
Pomp explained that he saw the advantages of using XRP in the Ripple ecosystem, but was skeptical of the cryptoasset for investment.
To me, if Ripple is successful, that doesn’t mean XRP has to be successful.
Pomp continued, saying that if you separate XRP and Ripple, the latter’s ultimate goal is to build better software for banks. He called Ripple’s mission a “no-brainer,” “venture capital bet” and admitted to being jealous of missing out on investing in Ripple’s seed round.
