However, compared to the Mexican payment corridor, the Philippines currently account for only half of this figure. The XRP/ MXN corridor recorded a volume of almost 14 million XRP on March 6th, with an all-time high of around 20.4 million XRP, reached in mid-February.
The total transaction volume of Ripple’s on-demand liquidity payment technology was $3.2 million yesterday, although the volume is highly volatile. On 05 March, this was 13.7 million US dollars. In mid-February, when ODL usage reached its peak, it was $16.8 million, according to the Utility Scan website.
MoneyGram as key partner for Ripple?
A key partner that could have a major impact on XRP’s transaction volume growth in the future is the global payment service provider MoneyGram. Most recently, MoneyGram announced that in December 2019, it recorded a 70% increase in online transactions compared to the previous year.
According to the payment service provider, On-Demand Liquidity has saved the company up to 75% in transaction fees. The two companies are working together to build a platform for international money transfers. Four new payment corridors for ODL are to be opened up before the end of the first quarter of 2020. In the long term, Ripple could thus also benefit from the strong growth of MoneyGram.
However, the effects on the XRP price cannot yet be measured at present. At the time of writing, the XRP price is moving in line with the current market sentiment and is down 4.2 percent.
