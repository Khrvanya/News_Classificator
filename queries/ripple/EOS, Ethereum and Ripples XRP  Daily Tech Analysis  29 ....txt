A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall to an early morning low $2.1209 before finding support.

EOS would need to move through to $2.20 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.2707.

Failure to break back through to $2.20 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall back through the morning low $2.1859 would bring the first major support level at $2.1163 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.00 levels. The second major support level at $2.0262 should limit any downside.
