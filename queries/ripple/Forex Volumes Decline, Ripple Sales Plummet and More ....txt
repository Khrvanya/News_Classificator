In a busy week of news, let’s take a look at the stories that dominated the news cycle in our picks of the week segment.
Has the Bubble Burst for Brokers?
After reporting on record volumes for many forex and CFD brokers in Q1, Finance Magnates covered a series of downturns this week.
In April, the number of DARTs were reported at 1.720 million transactions, a fall of 12% MoM from 1.96 million‎. Trading activity at Interactive Brokers LLC (NASDAQ:IBKR) lost some momentum in April with volumes easing. Although April’s figures saw a decline, it was still the second-best reading ever for Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs).
As Finance Magnates reported, Cboe’s institutional spot FX platform disclosed a total trading volume of $643 billion, down 46 percent on a month-over-month basis.
The decline saw trading volume fall to its lowest level since December 2019 and down 7% on an annual basis.
Another to suffer from the drop in volumes was FX SpotStream. Activity on FXSpotStream’s trading venue, the aggregator service of LiquidityMatch LLC, dropped sharply last month to its weakest in five months.
The company reported an average daily volume (ADV) of $34 billion, which is lower on a monthly basis by 45 percent from $62 billion back in March 2020.
TFX Forex Volumes Fall From March Highs in April, Stay Strong YoY
The last of the Finance Magnates reports of falling forex volumes covered TFX. Data from the Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) suggests that last month has not been as active as March.
April’s combined trading volume fell by 61.6 percent, but it is still 68.4 percent higher on an annual basis.
Dominating the cryptocurrency news this week was Ripple’s announcement of XRP sales for the first quarter of the year.
To many’s surprises, Ripple announced a staggering 87% decline for the first three months of the year. The disappointing figures follow an 80% decline in the final quarter of 2019.
