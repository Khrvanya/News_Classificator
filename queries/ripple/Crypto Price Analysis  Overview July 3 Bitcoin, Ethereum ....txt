Crypto Price Analysis & Overview July 3: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Kyber Network, and Bancor
Bitcoin pretty much moved sideways this week after slipping by a small 1%. While predominantly trading in a tight range, BTC did slip beneath a critical level on a couple of occasions but has managed to recover.
Last week, Bitcoin fell beneath a rising trend line formation that had been in play since mid-March. This provided the first alert that the uptrend could be stalling. This week, BTC has found support at a shorter termed rising trend line, adding to the strength of the support at $9,000.
Looking ahead, if the sellers push BTC beneath $9,000, then it would be a sign that they are looking to take charge of the market momentum. The first level of support lies at $8,800 (100-days EMA). Beneath this, added support is found at $8,709 (.382 Fib Retracement), and $8,500 (200-day EMA).
On the other side, the first level of resistance lies at $9,150. This is followed by $9,450, $9,815, and $10,000.
Ethereum saw a 1,61% price drop over the past week as it trades at $227. Last week, the coin also fell beneath a rising trend line that has been in play since mid-March 2020. After that, ETH headed lower until it found support at $215 (.236 Fib Retracement).
Luckily, ETH rebounded from there this week as it headed higher above the $225 level. Moving forward, if the sellers push beneath $225, the first level of support lies at $215 (.236 Fib Retracement). The next selling targets are found at $210 (100-day EMA) and $200 (200-day EMA).
On the other side, if the buyers push higher, the first level of resistance lies at $245 (bearish .786 Fib Retracement). This is followed by added resistance at $250 and $265 (bearish .886 Fib Retracement).
Against Bitcoin, ETH moved sideways this week as it trades beneath the 0.025 BTC level. At the start of the week, it dropped below 0.025 BTC as it headed lower toward the support at 0.0243 BTC (.236 Fib Retracement).
ETH rebounded from there as it pushed back into the resistance at the 0.025 BTC level. Looking ahead, if the buyers climb above 0.025 BTC, resistance is expected at 0.0253 BTC. Beyond this, added resistance lies at 0.026 BTC (bearish .786 Fib Retracement) 0.0263 BTC.
On the other side, the first level of support lies at 0.0243 BTC (.236 Fib Retracement). Beneath this, added support is found at 0.0239 BTC and 0.0235 BTC (.382 Fib Retracement).
XRP saw a small 3% price decline for the past week as the coin drops into the $0.175 support, provided by a .5 Fib Retracement. The coin had fallen beneath a descending triangle formation last week, which caused XRP to head lower into the support at $0.175.
The bulls have been defending this support throughout the entire week as XRP manages to close above $0.175 every day.
Looking ahead, if the sellers push beneath $0.175, the first level of support lies at $0.171. Beneath this, added support is located at $0.157 (.618 Fib Retracement) and $0.15.

It quickly broke the support at 1950 SAT and headed toward 1900 SAT. Luckily, it rebounded from here and has returned to 1950 SAT.
Looking ahead, if the sellers push lower again, the first level of support lies at 1900 SAT. Beneath this, added support is found at 1890 SAT, 1873 SAT, and 1843 SAT.
