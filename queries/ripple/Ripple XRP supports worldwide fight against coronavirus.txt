Ripple supports companies and people in need worldwide with donations to advance the fight against coronavirus.
The volume of transactions to the Philippines and other Asian countries reaches a new all-time high.
The coronavirus continues to weaken the economy and the cryptomarket worldwide, but is putting the lives of people in some economically weak countries at risk. Most recently, Stellar Lumens announced a donation of 2.5 million XLM to support charities fighting corona. Ripple is also committed to helping affected people around the world.
With more than 300 employees around the world and customers in more than 90 countries worldwide, Ripple has access to a large network. In the Bay Area, Ripple and its co-founder Chris Larsen will donate millions of dollars to food banks that provide food and drink to needy families and individuals in the region.
In addition, for every dollar donated, two meals will be provided by the Alameda County Comunity Food Bank. Loaves & Fishes Family Kitchen will also receive a $1 million donation from Ripple to provide food and drink to the needy in the region. Other supporters include Samaritan House, San Francisco-Marin Food Bank and the Second Harvest of Silicon Valley.
In addition, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) has provided a fund to help local people with small amounts of money to help them survive, and Ripple has also donated to this fund. There are many successful businesses in the Bay Area, but one in five people have less than $400 in their bank account and therefore depend on external help to survive.
Many migrant employees work in other countries and send money home to their families so that they can survive. XRP provides a good alternative to traditional bank transfers, which take several days to transfer money and are disproportionately expensive. On the payment corridor to the Philippines, the XRP Liqudity Index Bot shows that a new all-time high of 11,508,218 was reached on April 12, 2020.
