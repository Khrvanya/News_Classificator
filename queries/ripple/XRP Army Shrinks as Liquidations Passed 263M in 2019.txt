From dwindling numbers of Twitter users in Q1 to large-scale liquidations in 2019, reduced engagement has affected the price of XRP.
According to a quarterly report, online engagement towards XRP on Twitter fell in Q1 2020, while Ripple was forced to liquidate many of its holdings to stay cash flow positive.
The report , by social trading and investing platform eToro in partnership with analytics and finance management startup The Tie, indicates that the number of Twitter users discussing XRP fell by 16% in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, the number of users in the “XRP Army” — supporters of the cryptocurrency — has declined 82% since January 2018.
XRP losing support and value?
This is not the first trouble XRP has had with online engagement. A Twitter user compiled a list of Telegram groups on April 15 which showed over 63% of @Ripple members had left since June 2018.
Though the connection between online activity and price across all cryptocurrencies isn’t definitive, The Tie’s research does show a correlation between XRP price and the number of Twitter users across Q1 2020.
The token — $0.19 at the time of press — is worth a fraction of its $2.28 peak at the end of 2017.
In the first quarter of 2020, XRP was overtaken in daily volume by up-and-coming token Chainlink ( LINK ), and came close to losing its No. 3 spot in the Top 10 to Tether ( USDT ) during the flash crash in mid-March.
Even before the crypto bloodbath — which hit nearly every token hard — XRP was considered the worst performing large cap token . The Tie report noted that the firm “relied on XRP liquidations to stay cash-flow positive” in 2019:
“While Ripple liquidated only $13M worth of its XRP holdings in Q4 2019 (the least in three years), it sold over $250M worth in Q3 of last year. It is not yet known how much XRP Ripple sold in Q1 2020.”
These liquidations may be related to a class-action lawsuit the company is currently facing in New York. CEO Brad Garlinghouse is personally accused of pushing the token to prospective investors while quietly cashing out his holdings.
