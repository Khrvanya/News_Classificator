Ripple's CTO recently saw his YouTube channel suspended as antics persist on the platform.
Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, reported that his YouTube channel was suspended on April 29. This news comes several days after his company filed a lawsuit against the social media platform, although the two events may not be related.
The CTO's YouTube suspension occurred roughly eight days after his company, Ripple Labs, and company CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, filed a legal claim against the social video platform.
The lawsuit stated that YouTube did not remove impersonators and nefarious parties advertising false giveaways of XRP, the crypto asset associated with the company.
Such scams have plagued the crypto industry for years, in one form or another. The scams often include urging the public to send some amount of cryptocurrency, with the promise of receiving a larger amount in return.
Over the past several months, YouTube has banned a number of high-profile crypto YouTubers and videos, seemingly in waves. The platform subsequently restored many of the channels, sometimes after only one day of downtime. The problem, however, still reportedly persists.
It is unclear whether the ban has anything to do with Ripple's recent lawsuit. Cointelegraph reached out toÂ Schwartz and YouTube for comment, but received no response as of press time.
In light of the recent bans, Cointelegraph recently reported on a number of decentralized social video platform alternatives.
