It’s a bearish start to the day for the majors. A move through key levels would be needed to avoid the major support levels.
EOS fell by 0.53% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 3.43% rally from Friday, EOS ended the day at $2.7975.
It was a mixed start to the day. EOS fell to an early morning low $2.8000 before rising to a late morning intraday high $2.8455.
Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $2.8841, EOS slid to a late afternoon intraday low $2.7690.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.7273, EOS recovered to $2.81 levels before falling back into the red.
At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.14% to $2.7937. A relatively range-bound start to the day saw EOS fall from an early morning high $2.7948 to a low $2.7937.
EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.8040 levels to take a run at the first major resistance level at $2.8390 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break back through to $2.8000 levels.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $2.8390 would likely cap any upside.
Failure to move through to $2.8040 levels could see EOS spend a 2nd consecutive day in the red.
A fall through Friday’s low $2.7690 would bring the first major support level at $2.7625 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.70 support levels. The second major support level at $2.7275 should limit any downside.
Ethereum rose by 0.81% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 1.29% fall from Friday, Ethereum ended the day at $241.98.
A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning intraday low $237.67 before finding support.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $236.49, Ethereum struck a mid-day intraday high $244.52 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $245.74, Ethereum fell back to sub-$240 levels before finding support.
A late recovery to $243 levels was short-lived, however, with Ethereum wrapping up the day at $241 levels.
At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.39% to $241.03. A bearish start to the day saw Ethereum fall from an early morning high $241.95 to a low $240.99.
Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ethereum would need to move back through to $241.40 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $245.11.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from Saturday’s high $244.52.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high should cap any upside.
Failure to move through to $241.40 levels could see Ethereum give up Saturday’s gain.
A fall back through the morning low $240.99 would bring the first major support level at $238.26 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Ethereum should continue to steer clear sub-$230 levels on the day.
The second major support level at $234.54 should limit any downside on the day.
Ripple’s XRP rose by 0.57% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 0.81% fall from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.20370.
A mixed start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall to an early morning intraday low $0.20104 before finding support.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $0.2006, Ripple’s XRP rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $0.20502.
Coming up against the first major resistance level at $0.20520, Ripple’s XRP fell back to $0.2032 levels and into the red.
Finding late support, however, Ripple’s XRP recovered to $0.2037 levels to wrap up the day in the green.
At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.01% to $0.20368. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from an early morning high $0.20383 to a low $0.20332.
Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ripple’s XRP will need to avoid sub-$0.2030 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.2055.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from Saturday’s high $0.20502.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high would likely cap any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$0.2030 levels could see Ripple’s XRP reverse Saturday’s gain.
A fall back through the morning low $0.20327 would bring the first major support level at $0.2015 into play.
In the event of an extended sell-off, however, the second major support level at $0.1993 could come into play.
