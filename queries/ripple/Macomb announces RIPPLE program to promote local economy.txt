MACOMB (WGEM) — The City of Macomb announced the approval of its Resident Incentive for Purchases to Promote the Local Economy (RIPPLE) program on Tuesday.
City officials said the program offers a $25 rebate on a future water bill when a resident spends $150 at local “non-essential” businesses and restaurants.
Officials said the goal of the program is to encourage economic development at restaurants and nonessential businesses in Macomb that have been adversely affected by the pandemic.
The funds will come from the Community Improvement Fund to reimburse the water fund.
The program takes effect immediately.
