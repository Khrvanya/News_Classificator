Ripple has announced that it’s now a member of the Blockchain Association , an organization that advocates cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain networks.
“Not unlike the internet’s historic impact, blockchain and digital asset technologies have the power to engender greater financial inclusion and economic growth,” Ripple said in a release . “To realize the full potential of these technologies, though, industry leaders must come together to educate policymakers on the global impact.”
Michelle Bond, Ripple’s global head of government relations, will sit on the board of the association.
“We are excited to be included as members of the Blockchain Association — an association playing a key role in shaping our shared digital future,” Ripple said. “The Blockchain Association provides a unified voice, committed to building deep partnerships between technology leaders and policymakers.”
Ripple also expanded its global regulatory team, and it will be the first blockchain company with an office in Washington, D.C. Craig Phillips, a former counselor to the secretary at the U.S. Treasury Department, has joined Ripple’s board of directors, and will help to guide the company’s policy activities in Washington, D.C.
“In the U.S. and abroad, it’s important for policymakers to be armed with industry knowledge to help them shape conditions that will enable technological innovation to thrive,” Ripple said in the release. “At Ripple , we look forward to continued conversations with policymakers, and are building a team that brings a wealth of legislative and policy experience.”
Phillips will provide counsel to the company’s leadership organization, and advise on what the company calls “strategic regulatory opportunities.” The company’s global regulatory team will be led by Bond.
The global regulatory team will also include Susan Friedman, who will serve as international policy counsel, and Ron Hammond, manager of government relations.
