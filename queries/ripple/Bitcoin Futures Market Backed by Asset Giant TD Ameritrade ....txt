New York-based digital asset exchange ErisX, which is backed by giant brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, says trading hours for its cryptocurrency futures market will begin today.
ErisX’s notice to potential customers is light on details, but confirms trading hours are from 8:00 a.m. CT to 4:00 p.m. CT.
Earlier this year, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted ErisX a clearinghouse organization license.
In addition to the firm’s designated contract market license, ErisX can now offer compliant crypto futures contracts, which will be physically settled in Bitcoin (BTC).
TD Ameritrade’s executive vice president of trading and education, Steven Quirk, claims the company has had “off the charts” attendance at Bitcoin education events. Quirk has also said that the firm received many calls and emails from potential investors who are looking forward to trading digital currencies.
ErisX has attracted investments from ConsenSys, Cboe Global Markets, Pantera Capital, Castle Island and Dragonfly Capital Partners, which helped the company finalize a $20 million Series B round in April 2019.
The company’s marketing efforts are focused on capturing deal flow from established brokers such as TD Ameritrade.
TD Ameritrade was reportedly working on connecting to ErisX; however, this process may have been put on hold following TD Ameritrade’s acquisition by Charles Schwab in a $26 billion all-stock deal that closed in November.
