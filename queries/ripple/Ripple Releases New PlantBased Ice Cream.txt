Having already made a splash with their plant-based milks that pack as much protein as traditional dairy, Ripple has continued to expand their portfolio with products like yogurt, sour cream, protein shakes, barista-style, half-and-half, and more. Now, the company is making its first foray into the freezer aisle with the launch of Ripple Ice Cream beginning this month. The new line will include five flavors: vanilla, cinnamon churro, chocolate, mint chip, and cookies & crème.
The taste and texture is comparable to traditional dairy ice cream, but Ripple’s version will be 100% vegan and dairy-free. Each pint is formulated to be rich and indulgent, just like dairy ice cream, with each serving containing 250-280 calories. The ice cream will be available across all Sprouts Farmers Market locations starting yesterday, with additional distribution in the spring and summer.
