Barring a broad-based crypto rally, resistance at $2.5000 would likely pin EOS back on the day.
Failure to move through to $2.4150 levels could see EOS slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $2.3412 would bring the first major support level at $2.2487 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of the second major support level at S2.1173.

Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, however, the first major resistance level at $140.25 would likely limit any upside.

A fall back through the morning low $130.67 would bring the first major support level at $126.75 into play.
