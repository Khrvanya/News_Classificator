The Mexican crypto exchange Bitso has reported an extremely strong growth for the On-Demand Liquidity payment corridor XRP/MXN in April.
Bitso transferred more than 4.3 billion Pesos in April 2020, the equivalent of approximately USD 179 million in XRP transfers.
Bitso is the largest crypto exchange in Mexico with a customer base of more than 750,000 users and has become one of Ripple ‘s key partners in recent months. The two companies began working together last April to open the payment corridor for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) between Mexico and the United States. The Latin American market offers enormous potential with more than $30 billion in remittances annually.
In a recent update, Bitso’s CEO Daniel Vogel reported a strong growth in transactions with On-Demand Liquidity and the XRP token. According to a tweet, Bitso processed more than 4.3 billion pesos in April 2020, the equivalent of approximately $179 million in XRP remittances. In the previous month, the figure was only about 2.67 billion pesos, or about 111.5 million USD. Via Twitter Vogel wrote:
Bitso has seen an exponential increase in the processing of remittances through Ripple‘s technology, XRP and Bitso. In April, we processed more than 4.3 thousand million pesos [~USD$179M] in remittances. Below a chart with the remittances processed this year.
The Liquidity Index Bot on Twitter confirms Vogel’s numbers and shows that an extreme increase in XRP/MXN transaction volume was observed, especially in mid-April. Since the last week of April, however, the volume has declined significantly and is now roughly at the level reached at the end of March.
