Butterfest vendor feels ripple effect from canceled summer fests.
SPARTA, Wis. (WKBT) – We all have that special fest food we think about all year long.  The anticipation of finally smelling and eating that deep fried deliciousness.  But with all the fest cancellations, the vendors that usually show up are being hit hard.
“The grounds look a little different right now, it’s pretty quiet, it should be a lot louder than this. It should be hoppin’ down here!” said Kim Smith, the President of Sparta Events.
Summer means fest season, but with the pandemic, many of these have been cancelled, including Butterfest in Sparta.
“Here we are 36 years later, except this year,” said Smith.
The live music, car show, and animals will be missed. But what hurts the most….
“Definitely food vendors, that are down here something everyone gets once a year,” said Smith.
And some of these vendors include Oly’s mini donuts.
“It’s a pretty big loss in income for us this summer. You know, it’s all weather related obviously in the summer, but to go from that to nothing, it’s quite a big hit for us,” said Rick Gates, the Owner of Oly’s Mini Donuts.
Over a normal summer they can be found pumping out donuts at 12-15 different fests all across Wisconsin, but this summer you’ll only be able to find them in a parking lot.
“It just hurts, I’m sure other small businesses are hurting just as much,” said Gates. “It’s going to be a slow summer compared to normal.”
If you were looking forward to Butterfest, or Oly’s Mini Donuts, don’t worry! Butterfest is doing a virtual parade on Sunday and Oly’s Mini Donuts updates its Facebook page frequently to let customers know where they are, so you can still get your fest food fix.
