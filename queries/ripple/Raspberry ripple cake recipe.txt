Preheat the oven to 180C/160C fan/Gas 4. Base-line, oil and flour three 20cm-diameter round cake tins.
To make the syrup, mash the raspberries with the sugar and lemon juice and rub through a sieve.
To make the cake, place the juice, zest, water, oil, sugar, almond extract (if using) and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Sift over the flour and baking powder then mix very well to make a smooth batter.
Divide the batter between each tin (just under 700g in each if you are using scales). Drizzle three tablespoons of the raspberry syrup over each. Draw the point of a knife through to marble the mixture. Dot the top with fresh raspberries.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until a skewer stuck in the middle comes out clean. Cool for five minutes in the tin and then turn out on a wire rack to finish cooling.
Make the icing by beating the melted vanilla ice cream, butter, icing sugar and vanilla extract together.
Sandwich the cakes together with four tablespoons of icing between each one. Spread the icing on the sides and top of the cake, scraping the sides with a palette knife to give a “naked” effect. Trickle over the remaining raspberry syrup, letting it drip down the sides, and top with the raspberries, plus ice cream wafers if you like.
