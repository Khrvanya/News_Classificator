MoneyGram launches debit card service, Ripple CEO to appear on CNN
In summer this year, Ripple closed one of the biggest deals with the global payments platform MoneyGram.
This has had a positive effect on the share price of MoneyGram, letting it rise over 150 percent right after the acquisition in June. Now, a chart from NASDAQ says that since then, the share price of MoneyGram has risen by almost 350 percent.
Data shows that after Ripple had bought a $30-mln stake at the global payment giant, MoneyGram shares surged in price by 153.79 percent – that is $2.23.
About a month ago, MoneyGram started utilizing Ripple’s xRapid along with XRP for conducting its global payments. That was confirmed by the MoneyGram chief executive Alex Holmes.
Now, a NASDAQ chart shows that this figure has reached to nearly 350 percent, the price closed at $5.66. The chart was tweeted by a crypto business angel @CryptoWelson.
MoneyGram launches debit card service, Ripple CEO to appear on CNN
Earlier, U.Today reported that the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse agreed to an interview on CNN today, on September 11. The exact time of the show was not named.
At the moment, many in the Ripple community are curious whether MoneyGram plans to expand its XRP usage. Recently, it was reported that MoneyGram and Visa Direct have launched a debit card deposit service in the US.
However, since MoneyGram is currently using xRapid and XRP, investors and hodlers are curious whether the payments giant is going to shift to the XRP track once the debit card service goes beyond the US and gets to be used by the rest of the world.
