EOS would need to move through to $2.6750 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $2.7437 into play.

Barring an extended crypto rally, however, the major first resistance level would likely cap any upside.
Failure to move back through to $2.6750 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall through to the morning low $2.6356 would bring the first major support level at $2.5924 into play.
