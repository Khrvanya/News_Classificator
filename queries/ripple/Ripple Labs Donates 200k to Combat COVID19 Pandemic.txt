Ripple will allocate funds to non-profit organizations in favor of fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
Ripple Labs announced a donation of $200,000 to two different non-profit organizations on March 25. These donations will aid in the fight to contain the spread of the coronavirus throughout the U.S.
In a tweet published on Ripple’s official profile, the lab stated that $100,000 will go to the Tipping Point Emergency’s Response Fund and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation’s COVID Regional Response Fund, respectively.
Tipping Point, which is a San Francisco-based non-profit organization, works to combat poverty in the California city thanks to a network of partners who support the cause. They hope to raise $1 million in total for the COVID-19 response initiative.
On the other hand, The Silicon Valley Community Foundation is focused on containing the effects of COVID-19 throughout the Silicon Valley area. This is an especially prescient move during a time when governments around the world have taken measures to ensure that citizens are observing proper social distancing procedures.
However, scams impersonating cryptocurrency foundations have also appeared on the scene.
A  YouTube scam, previously reported by Cointelegraph on March 24, consisted of a YouTube account impersonating Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. The account openly promoted a fraudulent crypto airdrop.
Garlinghouse posted a warning through his Twitter account, directly addressing the emergence of scammers through YouTube:
“Enough is enough -- in a time of global crisis, when people are especially vulnerable -- social platforms need to hold scammers (crypto and otherwise) accountable for stealing money from innocent victims with fake giveaways.”
