Volatility is one of the top known characteristics of the cryptocurrency world. Keeping up with the changes in the value of the several coins can be so draining. Even if you choose to concentrate on a few, it is still time-consuming as the prices change as fast as after every hour.
That is not to say you cannot keep up with a particular coin and market if you want to. Once you have mastered the price shakers of a market, you can easily monitor changes and predict them correctly.
Here are some of the most prevalent price shakers in the Ripple-Euro market you must know;
Cryptocurrency is an evolving field. New coins are ever coming up looking to correct the mistakes of the already established ones. Ripple, as part of the system, is also in this constant competition. It takes some of the top technological systems to survive in such a setup.
So far, Ripple has proven to have a reliable system that can withstand changes. The crypto is ever-changing to meet new challenges.
Ripple Labs is always looking for ways to improve cross-border payments. It has Ripple Net that is already adopted by several financial institutions due to the instant money transfer.

For a long time, the Euro market has been free from any government interference. The government has been supportive, leading to thriving crypto trade. That might change soon with the revelation of the possibility of crypto aiding crimes like human traffic, narcotics purchase, and money laundering.
Already the government is looking into possible ways to control the market. Regulated trading will affect the Ripple-Euro market as most of the traders would likely migrate to other places with fewer regulations.
The regulations might also limit the amounts one can trade in a given period.
Like any other sector, media is another essential entity to cryptocurrency. Most of the coins use the media in creating hype before an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with much success. The success of Ripple is tied to the role of the press.
The Euro Market has a vibrant media with public trust. The more Ripple cooperates with the media, the more it increases its acquisition leading to better market trading.
By the time you consider investing in cryptocurrency, you already know Bitcoin is the chief coin. It is so influential, and no other coin comes close. The effects of Bitcoin in the market are so significant that any changes affect the other currencies.
The same applies to Ripple and the Euro market. An increase in value in Bitcoin is likely to spread to Ripple, leading to positive change.
Even though it is not yet at the Bitcoin's level, Ripple has cemented its place as one of the most useful crypto coins in the world. Also, though massively traded all over, the Euro market remains one of the most important for the currency.
The government, technology, media, and the changes in Bitcoin, all affect how that market performs.
