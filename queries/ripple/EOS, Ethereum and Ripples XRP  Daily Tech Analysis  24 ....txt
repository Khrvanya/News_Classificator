It’s a bullish start to the day for the majors. A move back through early highs would be needed, however, to avoid a pullback.
EOS rose by 2.04% on Thursday. Following on from a 4.09% rally on Wednesday, EOS ended the day at $2.6806.
A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall to a mid-morning intraday low $2.5860 before making a move.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.5375, EOS rallied to an early afternoon intraday high $2.7764.
EOS broke through the first major resistance level at $2.6884 and second major resistance level at $2.7500.
Late in the day, EOS fell back through the resistance levels to wrap up the day at $2.68 levels.
At the time of writing, EOS was up by 0.92% to $2.7053. A bullish start to the day saw EOS rise from an early morning low $2.6820 to a high $2.7115.
EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to avoid sub-$2.70 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.7760.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from the morning high $2.7115.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$2.70 levels could see EOS struggle later in the day.
A fall through to sub-$2.68 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.5856 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer well clear of the second major support level at $2.4906.
Ethereum rose by 1.40% on Thursday. Following on from a 7.05% rally on Wednesday, Ethereum ended the day at $185.66.
Tracking the broader market, Ethereum fell to a mid-morning intraday low $178.44 before finding support.

Ethereum would need to avoid sub-$187 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $194.20.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $190 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, resistance at $190 would likely leave Ethereum short of the first major resistance level.
Failure to avoid sub-$187 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse.
A fall through to sub-$186.30 levels would bring the first major support level at $177.78 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $169.90.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to breakout from the morning high $0.1970.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $0.2000 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$0.1930 levels could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse.
A fall through to sub-$0.1900 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.1861 into play.
