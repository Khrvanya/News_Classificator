The pandemic has posed a nearly impossible challenge for art galleries and museums: How to share art—actual physical work, not digital representations of such—in a safe and socially distant environment? One winning strategy: Have a gigantic space. ArtPort , an exhibition space housed in the cavernous Cornell Steamboat Building on Kingston's waterfront, has launched two ongoing exhibitions that capitalize on its spacious digs. Inside the building, "The Ripple Effect" features a sprawling installation by Brooklyn-based artist Jelia Gueramian. Inspired by a childlike sense of wonder, Gueramian uses found materials to create alternative worlds that invite viewers to awaken their senses and lose themselves in another reality. Outside, "ArtStream" is a collection of site-specific artworks, installations, sculptures, and performances that will evolve over the course of the summer.
Artport is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 12 to 5pm.
