Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is down roughly 10% Wednesday morning as it continues to slide downward â€” bottoming out at $1.62 per coin, less than half its value a week ago.
The negative spiral began on Monday , when popular data site CoinMarketCap opted to exclude prices from South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges from its data , causing the prices to show dramatic drops on its site.
This "likely triggered some panic selling," Ripple's chief cryptographer David Schwartz said , further dragging down the price. The move by CoinMarketCap also affected many other cryptocurrencies, including the flagship bitcoin
XRP had previously seen an astronomical rise from its low of $0.15 in March 2017, gaining some 2000% to reach $3.315 per token on January 4.
The cryptocurrency currently has the third-largest market cap among digital tokens, behind bitcoin and Ethereum, with a total value of $75.58 billion, according to OnChainFX , a site that many traders have switched.
