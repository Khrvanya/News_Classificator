By CCN : Ripple (XRP) and most other cryptocurrencies should be looking over their shoulders now that Facebook has announced it is launching GlobalCoin (or Libra), according to Bitcoin expert Max Keiser.
In Keiser’s opinion, GlobalCoin will render altcoins irrelevant, and this includes Ripple . The Bitcoin bull also sees the Facebook coin obliterating payments and remittance companies leveraging cryptocurrencies:
“The $FB global stable coin… FaceCoin obviates need for hundreds of alt-cons including XRP. The alt-coin apocalypse is nigh.”
