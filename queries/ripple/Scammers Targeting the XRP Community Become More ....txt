The team at Ripple has also observed that scammers are increasingly targeting the XRP community and has provided information on how to spot such scams.
In a very elaborate post , the team at Ripple has explained that the easiest way of spotting a scam is when the imposters request cryp to before sending the reward they have promised. The team at Ripple further explains that winnings from a legitimate offer are usually free to redeem.
In many cases, the first warning that a giveaway ad is a scam is that in order to receive the reward, you must first send money and/or provide your personal financial account information.
For any real sweepstakes, winnings are always free and never ask for money or financial account information upfront.
As earlier mentioned, scammers are evolving with many employing more sophisticated tactics to appear legitimate. Some of their tricks include:
Team Ripple further explains that personal due diligence is key in validating any giveaway on social media.
If a giveaway looks real, we suggest first visiting the company‚Äôs main website and verified social channels to confirm if the ad is readily viewable.
If an ad is real, more than likely the sweepstakes are also featured on the main pages of legitimate company sites.
Also, you can contact the company directly and inquire about the contest.
Additionally, in response to the increment in scams targeting the XRP community, the team at Ripple has hired an external cybersecurity and digital threat intelligence vendor to help in the efforts of identifying and taking down fraudulent giveaways. XRP community members are also requested to report any unusual activity using this form .
