Ripple CTO suspended from YouTube, warned not to return
Ripple CTO, Dabid Schwartz, recently got suspended from YouTube, days after Ripple sued the video giant.
Ripple previously filed a lawsuit against YouTube for not reacting against XRP scams, which harmed the firm.
Ripple, the company behind the third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP, is no stranger to lawsuits and accusations of being a scam. The firm, as well as its officials, were sued numerous times, even by their coin’s own users.
However, a few days ago, it was the company’s time to file a lawsuit and to target none other than YouTube . According to Ripple, the world’s largest video streaming platform is guilty of allowing XRP giveaway scam videos.
Not only that, but the filing also said that YouTube waited for too long to suspend fraudulent channels. This led to numerous users losing hundreds of thousands of dollars to scammers. At the same time, Ripple’s own reputation suffered.
Then, without any warning, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, discovered this morning that his YouTube channel got suspended. Schwartz, also known as ‘Joel Katz’ online, tweeted the following:
“Weirdly, YouTube just decided to suspend my channel (SJoelKatz) for impersonation. I wonder who they think I was impersonating.”

He also noted that YouTube now prohibits him from ‘accessing, possessing, or creating any other Youtube accounts.’
"Please be aware that you are prohibited from accessing, possessing or creating any other YouTube accounts." — Does this mean I can't watch any YouTube videos anymore?

Interestingly, the move comes only days after the news of the lawsuit made headlines around the world. Of course, YouTube reserves the right to terminate any channel that violates its rules and guidelines. Over the last few years, the list of ‘unwanted behavior’ includes predatory behavior, harassment, hate speech, as well as impersonations.
And, while the channel owners are not allowed to create a new channel, they can still file a complaint if YouTube moved against them for no reason. Such things do happen, after all, usually by mistake or a software error.
However, considering the situation regarding YouTube and Ripple, the ban of the company’s CTO is certainly interesting. Schwartz owned his account for years, and YouTube did not have a single issue with it until now. If nothing else, the timing is quite coincidental, as the legal proceedings are just about to start.
The lawsuit claims that “Ripple has repeatedly demanded that YouTube take action to stop the Scam and prevent further harm. Yet YouTube refuses, even where the same scheme is replicated time and again on its platform. YouTube’s response has been woefully inadequate and incomplete. As a result, Ripple and Mr. Garlinghouse continue to suffer substantial reputational harm.“
Of course, there is always a chance that the platform’s algorithm simply messed up again, and that the issue will be fixed.
