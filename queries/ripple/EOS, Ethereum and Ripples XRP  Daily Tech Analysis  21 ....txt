EOS would need to move back through to $2.55 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.6408.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from the morning high $2.5418.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Monday’s high $2.6706 should limit any upside.
Failure to move back through to $2.55 levels could see EOS give up the early gains.
A fall back through the morning low $2.5020 would bring the first major support level at $2.4105 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.40 levels on the day.
