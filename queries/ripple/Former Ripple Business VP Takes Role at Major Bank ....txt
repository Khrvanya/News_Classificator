Former Ripple executive Kahina Van Dyke took on the role of Global Head, Digital Channels and Client Data Analytics at major bank Standard Chartered.
Kahina Van Dyke, former senior vice president of business and development at blockchain firm Ripple, took on the role of Global Head, Digital Channels and Client Data Analytics at major bank Standard Chartered.
According to an official announcement published by Standard Chartered on Feb. 19, Van Dyke joined the bank’s Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking (CCIB) division.
The CCIB division focuses on corporate clients, financial institutions, and investors. The experts working on the team connect those clients with each other, and provide them advice and access to financing. CCIB chief executive Simon Cooper explained in the announcement that he expects Van Dyke to take Standard Chartered’s “data analytics and channel capabilities to the next level.”
Before working at Ripple, she also worked at Facebook as global director of financial services and payments. Neither Van Dyke nor Standard Chartered had answered Cointelegraph’s inquiry at press time.
According to company information website Owler, Standard Chartered has an annual revenue of $14.4 billion and staffs 85,000 employees.
While the announcement does not clarify whether Standard Chartered plans to leverage the blockchain-related experience Van Dyke earned while working at Ripple, it would be quite unsurprising given that Standard Chartered has shown interest in the technology in the past.
As Cointelegraph reported in November 2019, Standard Chartered joined blockchain standard-building organization the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance . In August 2019, the bank also completed its first joint blockchain-based supply chain financing transaction.
