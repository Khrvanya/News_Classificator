At the heart of all cryptocurrencies is the blockchain. As the name suggests, this is quite literally a series of data blocks chained together. Technically, crypto proponents will refer to this concept as a decentralized, distributed public ledger.
In a traditional business environment, ledgers may contain all kinds of information. But the process of inputting this information is private (say, a corporation’s financial ledger) and centralized (only authorized managers can input information).
But what if data could be inputted in a fair, transparent manner that is open to all and yet has the security protocol of the wealthiest institutions? With the blockchain, anyone can participate in the data inputting process, called “mining.” For their troubles, miners receive cryptocurrencies, or blockchain reward tokens.
