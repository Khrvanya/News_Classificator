A local organization is feeling a ripple effect from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Parents for Community Living an organization based out of Waterloo that provides homes and family support for developmentally challenged individuals has already made some adjustments to its everyday operations.
"It's impacting staffing, anybody who is even slightly ill we are asking to stay home for the time being to protect the people we support, it is a drain on our staff resources," said Kathy Loveys, Executive Director of Parents for Community Living.
Although they are low on staff, Loveys said the staff that is able to work have rallied together to come up with new routines to help support and maintain the safety of the individuals in their homes. That includes different activities and games that can be done inside.
"I am very fortunate that we have such an exceptional team," she said.
Loveys told the Mike Farwell Show on 570 NEWS that Parents for Community Living will continue to run its homes even with the ongoing worldwide outbreak.
"We have to absolutely support the folks in the community, the individuals that we support depend on us to do so, as do their families."
The organization is calling on the public to lend a hand. They are in need of masks and baby monitors at their homes.
