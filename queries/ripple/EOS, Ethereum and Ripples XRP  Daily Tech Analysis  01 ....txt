EOS slid by 5.78% on Thursday. Partially reversing an 8.55% rally from Wednesday, EOS ended April up by 27.59% to $2.8263.
A bullish start to the day saw EOS rally to a mid-morning intraday high $3.1104 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $3.1491, EOS slid to a late morning intraday low $2.7409.
The reversal saw EOS fall through the first major support level at $2.8019 before recovering to $2.90 levels.
Through the 2nd half of the day, EOS fell back through the first major support level to $2.77 levels before finding late support.
At the time of writing, EOS was up by 0.73% to $2.8469. A bullish start to the day saw EOS rise from an early morning low $2.8258 to a high $2.8531.
EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.8930 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $3.0442.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break back through to $3.00 levels.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Thursday’s high $3.1104 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to move through to $2.8930 levels could see EOS hit reverse.
A fall through to sub-$2.80 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.6746 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto sell-off, however, EOS should steer well clear of the second major support level at $2.5229.

Ethereum would need to move through to $212 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $221.72.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $220 levels.
Barring an extended crypto rally, resistance at $220 would likely leave Ethereum short of the first major resistance level.
Failure to move through to $212 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse.
A fall back through Thursday’s low $202.30 would bring the first major support level at $196.52 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$200 levels on the day.

Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $0.2288 would likely leave Ripple’s XRP short of $0.23 levels.
Failure to move through to $0.2185 levels could see Ripple’s XRP give up the early gains.
A fall through the morning low $0.21121 would bring the first major support level at $0.2013 into play.
