EOS fell by 0.06% on Sunday. Following on from a 2.04% slide on Saturday, EOS ended the week down by 6.59% to $2.5765.
Tracking the broader market, EOS fell to an early morning intraday low $2.5464 before finding support.
Steering clear of the major support levels, EOS rallied to a mid-morning intraday high $2.6031.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $2.6256, EOS fell back to $2.55 levels before closing out at $2.57 levels.
At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.49% to $2.5638. A bearish start to the day saw EOS fall from an early morning high $2.5773 to a low $2.5601.
EOS would need to move through to $2.5740 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.6023.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break through to $2.60 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $2.6031 would likely cap any upside.
Failure to move through to $2.5740 levels could see EOS slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $2.5601 would bring the first major support level at $2.5456 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.50 levels. The second major support level at $2.5176 should limit any downside.
Ethereum rose by 0.47% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 2.05% slide from Saturday, Ethereum ended the week down by 5.51% to $142.38.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ethereum would need to move back through to $142 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $144.31.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Ethereum to break out from the morning high $142.53.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, however, resistance at $144 would likely pin Ethereum back on the day.
Failure to move back through to $142 levels could see Ethereum struggle throughout the day.
A fall back through the morning low $140.58 would bring the first major support level at $140.12 and sub-$140 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should steer clear of the second major support level at $137.87.

A move back through to $0.2180 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.2206.
Support from the broader market would be needed for Ripple’s XRP to break out from Sunday’s high $0.22039.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, however, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.22 levels on the day.
Failure to move back through to $0.2180 levels could see Ripple’s XRP lose more ground on the day.
A fall through the second major support level at $0.2132 could bring sub-$0.21 levels into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the third major support level at $0.2084.
