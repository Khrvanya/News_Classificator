Ripple’s Xpring initiative has invested at least $500 million in various projects since it was launched in 2018.
The Block’s John Dantoni tracked Xpring’s investments and found that the initiative has contributed to at least 27 projects to date, including Compound, Dharma, Securitize, Bitso and Forte.
Xpring invested $100 million in Forte last year - a blockchain-based gaming platform, which leverages Xpring's open-source Interledger Protocol with XRP serving as a base pair settlement. Many of Xpring’s investments are related to Ripple’s core business model, centered around XRP and payments development, as Dantoni noted.
Last year, Xpring made at least 18 investments. This year, the initiative has been quiet, with only two investments so far - in crypto ATM provider Coinme and blockchain platform for decentralized applications NEAR Protocol.
