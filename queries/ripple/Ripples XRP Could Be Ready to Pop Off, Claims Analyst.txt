Every Dog Has Its Day: Stacking Up Ripple’s Recurring Yearly Rallies
It’s rare that XRP is able to sustain a strong rally. Not only are investors seeking to sell the asset at the first glimmer of recovery after spending more than two years underwater , Ripple executes themselves add selling pressure to the market to fund regular company operations.
But at least once per year, typically coinciding with Ripple’s annual Swell conferenc e, XRP experiences a massive pump.
Dating back to the crypto hype bubble, XRP has at least one per year had a powerful pump.
The first was in the above chart can be seen in late December 2017, propelling Ripple to an all-time high of over $3.50, or 23,000 satoshi on the Bitcoin trading pair.
The next pump took place in 2018, resulting in an explosive 167% return for XRP investors on the XRP/BTC trading pair.
Again in 2019, Ripple had another pump, but only resulting in a 50% return. Each time following the asset reaching its all-time high has resulted in decreasing gains with each annual rally.
However, the next major rally could be incredibly explosive now that sell pressure is running out following over two years of downtrend.
When resistance finally breaks, XRP’s first target would be 4000 sats, or roughly a 50% climb, mimicking the performance of the 2019 pump. However, if that target is taken out quickly, more explosive upside could result from over two years of a downtrend .
On average, XRP has rallied 555% between the three rallies, showing just how high the asset could potentially rise if the first 50% target is taken out.
