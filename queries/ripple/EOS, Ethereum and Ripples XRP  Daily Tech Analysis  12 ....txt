EOS rose by 0.65% on Saturday. Following an 8.69% tumble on Friday, EOS ended the day at $2.5122.
A bullish start to the day saw EOS rise to a mid-morning intraday high $2.5493 before hitting reverse.
Falling short of the first major resistance level at $2.6863, EOS slid to a late intraday low $2.4289.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.3580, EOS bounced back to $2.52 levels before easing back.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through to $2.50 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.5647.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from Saturday’s high $2.5493.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $2.50 would likely leave EOS short of the first major resistance level.
Failure to move through to $2.50 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red.
A fall back through the morning low $2.4767 would bring the first major support level at $2.4443 into play.
Barring another crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of the second major support level at $2.3764.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to breakout from Saturday’s high $161.50.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $160 would likely leave Ethereum short of the first major resistance level.
Failure to move back through to $158 levels could see Ethereum fall deeper into the red.
A fall through to sub-$156 levels would bring the first major support level at $154.67 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ethereum should continue to steer clear of sub-$150 support levels.
The second major support level at $150.78 should limit any downside on the day.

Failure to move back through to $0.1980 levels could see Ripple’s XRP struggle throughout the day.
A fall through the morning low $0.18708 would bring the first major support level at $0.1851 into play.
