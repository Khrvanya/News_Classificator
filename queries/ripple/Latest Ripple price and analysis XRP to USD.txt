Volatility has returned to Ripple’s XRP token with it trading between an eight percent range on Monday morning.
It initially sprung from the $0.14791 level of support to $0.1626 before suffering a sell-off, with it now trading back down at $0.15623.
The announcement from the Fed caused a temporary hike in the US stock market, reiterating the positive correlation equity markets have with cryptocurrencies.
From a short-term perspective, XRP needs to continue closing daily candles above the $0.14791 level of support as it aims to push towards a potential breakout.
A confirmed breakout would come into fruition if XRP can rally to above $0.17443, which has become a bitter point of resistance since the gruelling move to the downside earlier this month.
However, the overall trend remains bearish with Ripple’s token trading at around its lowest point for three years, with price declining by more than 95% during that period.
Downside targets remain at $0.13491 and $0.06178 although much of the upcoming price action depends on the trajectory of Bitcoin moving into the halving.
