Not to mention, in a recent TradingView post,
popular analyst TradingShot noted that XRP is seemingly poised to explode higher, pointing to a confluence of bullish technical factors to back such sentiment:
The logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) on the weekly chart just printed a bullish crossover.
The 50-week and 100-week simple moving averages are preparing to form a bullish cross in the coming months.
The fundamentals may back a surge in the price of XRP.
At the World Economic Forum, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse made a surprising announcement; he said at an event that he wants to bring his fintech company to a public stock market in the near future.
According to an article from CoinTelegraph , Mati Greenspan, the founder of QuantumEconomics and an ex-eToro analyst, said in a comment that an IPO could help XRP’s price in the long run , claiming that it “would be positive” as “Additional funding for Ripple would mean less reason to sell off tokens.” Greenspan was referencing the idea that the sales of XRP by Ripple has depressed the price of the cryptocurrency.
