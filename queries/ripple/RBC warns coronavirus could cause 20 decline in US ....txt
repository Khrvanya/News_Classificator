The coronavirus and its ripple effect on consumer demand could send global auto production down as much as 16%, according to RBC Capital Markets.
The lower forecast is fueled by falling demand in the U.S. and China.
Shares of publicly-traded U.S. automakers are down between about 30% and 40% this month, including double-digit losses Monday.
The coronavirus and its ripple effect on consumer demand could send global auto production down 16% in 2020, fueled partially by an expected 20% decline in U.S. sales, according to RBC Capital Markets.
The new forecasts come as automaker stocks decline more than other industries amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Shares of publicly-traded U.S. automakers are down between about 30% and 40% this month, including double-digit losses Monday.
Tesla remains the only U.S. automaker with its shares in the black for this year. However, it's leading this month's declines compared to General Motors , Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler . Tesla shares closed Monday down 18.6%, with the stock falling 40.2% for the month. Shares remain up 6.4% for the year.
Fiat Chrysler, which Monday said it would shutter a majority of its European plants , is down 36.3% in March, including a 21.6% decline on Monday to $7.86. Both Ford and GM are down more than 30% this month. All three stocks hit new 52-week lows Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed nearly 3,000 points lower Monday, or 12.9%, at 20,188.52. The S&P 500 dropped 12% to 2,386.13 — hitting its lowest level since December 2018 — while the Nasdaq Composite closed 12.3% lower at 6,904.59 in its worst day ever.
COVID-19 was first a supply and demand issue for automakers in China, however as it spread to other countries, including the U.S., it quickly sparked concerns of a global recession and falling consumer demand .
RBC said its new forecast for global automotive production being down 16% is largely "from a demand perspective," including retail sales in China – the world's largest auto market  – being cut in half so far this year.
"We assume the impact in the U.S. could be similar before a recovery later in year," wrote RBC's Joseph Spak in a note to investors Monday morning.
The new forecast calls for U.S. auto sales to fall to 13.5 million vehicles, 20% below last year's sales. At the beginning of the year, many were calling for U.S. auto sales to be about 16.5 million to 17 million.
