The race for third place is still far from over.
Tether ( USDT ) has overtaken XRP to become the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as Ripple fails to gain adoption amongst retail investors.

As for Ripple ( XRP ), it's been a race to the bottom, its market cap has collapsed from a high around $130 billion in January 2018 to the current one under $9 billion. At one point XRP was jockeying for the number two position with Ether ( ETH ), however, currently, the combined market cap of XRP and USDT is still $5 billion behind Ether.
Perhaps part of the problem for XRP is a lack of traction with retail investors . In terms of daily trading volume, USDT dwarfs XRP. USDT’s average daily volume in May has outpaced XRP’s by a factor of 25.
But this doesn’t mean that the race for third place is over. With a decent bull run , XRP could blow past its stablecoin rival, which cannot move up or down by more than a few percentage points.
