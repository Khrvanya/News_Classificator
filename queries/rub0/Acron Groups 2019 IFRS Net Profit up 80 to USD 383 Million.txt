In the reporting period, the cost of sales was up 10% year-on-year to RUB 59,784 million, mainly due to higher sales, growing depreciation and amortisation, increased prices for energy and diesel fuel, and greater payroll costs.
Depreciation and amortisation increased following the launch of a new urea unit at the end of 2018 and two nitric acid units in 2019, as well as equipment upgrades at the existing production facilities. Higher payroll costs were due to a 5% increase in the number of Group’s employees required for the development of the Oleniy Ruchey underground mine, implementation of investment projects at Acron and Dorogobuzh, and construction of the Talitsky mine.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 15% to RUB 9,332 million as the Group’s expanded international distribution drove an increase in sales, number of employees and leased warehouse capacity. The goal of this expansion is to increase sales to end users.
Transportation expenses were up 17% to RUB 20,774 million, mainly due to increased freight costs amid growing sales to the United States and Latin America on terms that include transportation. In addition, the cost of logistics services outside of Russia increased as the rouble softened.
EBITDA decreased 4% year-on-year to RUB 35,749 million. In the reporting period, EBITDA margin was 31%, against 34% in 2018. Veliky Novgorod-based Acron, Dorogobuzh, and NWPC operated at margins of 38%, 18%, and 23%, respectively. Dorogobuzh’s lower margin in the reporting period was temporary and caused by a stoppage of the ammonia unit to perform upgrades.
In 2019, interest expense declined to RUB 1,115 million from RUB 1,607 million in 2018. Based on 2019 results, the Group posted a net exchange profit of RUB 7,013 million, driven by the revaluation of assets, loans and liabilities, against a RUB 7,043 million loss in 2018. In the reporting period, the gain from the change in the fair value of derivatives was RUB 1,445 million, against a RUB 896 million gain in 2018.
In 2019, net profit increased 86% to RUB 24,786 million, against RUB 13,318 million year-on-year.
In 2019, net operating cash flow was RUB 28,278 million, almost unchanged year-on-year. In 2019, working capital decreased by RUB 2,084 million, while in 2018, working capital was down RUB 1,025 million.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 came in at RUB 19,054 million, against RUB 14,439 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were up 31% to RUB 19,030 million from RUB 14,542 million in 2018. In dollar equivalent, capital expenditures increased 27% to USD 294 million as the Group pursued its Development Strategy.
Net cash allocated to financial activities in 2019 was RUB 7,328 million (2018: RUB 19,643 million). The decline in cash outflow in the reporting period was caused by lower repayment of borrowings. In 2019, net borrowings raised amounted to RUB 8,840 million, against RUB 28 million of net borrowings repaid in 2018. In the reporting period, RUB 14,313 million were paid in dividends (2018: RUB 13,278 million). In dollar equivalent, dividend payments in 2019 stood at USD 221 million against USD 212 million in 2018.
In 2019, total debt was up 2% to RUB 86,541 million (USD 1,398 million in dollar equivalent). In May 2019, the Group received a two-year extension on its five-year syndicated structured pre-export loan facility for up to USD 750 million, increasing the share of long-term debt to 85% from 79% on 31 December 2018.
Net debt was up 2% from 31 December 2018 to RUB 75,185 million. In dollar equivalent, it was up 14% to USD 1,215 million due to a stronger rouble as of the end of the reporting period compared to 31 December 2018.
As of the end of the reporting period, net debt/LTM EBITDA was 2.1, against 2.0 on 31 December 2018. In dollar equivalent, the ratio increased to 2.2 from 1.8.
Throughout 2019, global mineral fertiliser prices declined. Urea prices were affected by several factors, including slower U.S. consumption amid adverse weather conditions, increased European output due to lower gas prices, and higher Chinese exports. In the fourth quarter, negative price trends encouraged potential buyers to postpone purchases in expectation of lower prices. As a result, by the beginning of 2020 inventories in the key markets had been depleted, which, coupled with seasonal demand in the United States and Europe, contributed to the recovery of prices in the first quarter of 2020. Prices may receive further support when India begins making active purchases amid lower Chinese exports.
As urea prices decreased, AN and UAN prices slumped as well in 2019. NPK prices were under pressure due to lower prices for nitrogen, phosphate, and potash fertilisers. However, the drop in NPK prices was moderate compared to those products, which resulted in the NPK premium over the basic product basket over 20%. Global demand for NPK continues to grow. In particular, Brazil boosted NPK imports 27% to 1.5 million tonnes, of which 63% are supplied by Russian manufacturers. Other countries in the region are also increasing their NPK consumption.
