Toothpaste doesn’t belong on your genitals (Picture: Getty)
A quick word of warning before you go about your day: Please don’t rub toothpaste on your penis.
Is this something we should have to say? No, but apparently we must, for there are men out in the world rubbing toothpaste on their penis to try to last longer in bed.
The ‘trick’ is promoted all over YouTube, Reddit, and Steemit, with one man, Jose Barber, claiming that massaging toothpaste on the penis will ‘crush premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction without dangerous drugs’.
Shockingly enough, these claims probably aren’t accurate.
There’s no evidence of any sort to back up the idea that toothpaste could delay orgasm and keep you erect for longer. Instead you’re likely to cause irritation and burning – both for you and your sexual partner.
A general rule for all to follow: Minty products and genitals don’t really mix. Don’t you remember the story of a woman who learned the hard way to keep minty shower gel away from her vagina ?
James O’Loan, a pharmacist at online doctor service Doctor-4-U, has issued a warning against applying toothpaste to the penis for any reason.
He said: ‘I’d urge anyone thinking of trying this rather worrying ‘toothpaste’ technique to cease and desist – because it won’t do anything at all to combat premature ejaculation or erectile dysfunction, despite the claims being made in these videos.
‘The peppermint oils and other chemicals in toothpaste, including bleaching agents, can be extremely irritating to sensitive skin.
“By putting it on your genitals you actually risk a mild burn, as well as blisters and scarring.
‘And toothpaste should in no way be used as a lubricant, either.’
Attempting this hack at home could result in painful blisters and burns on the penis, as well as serious discomfort and irritation for whoever’s vagina or anus you pop your penis inside.
