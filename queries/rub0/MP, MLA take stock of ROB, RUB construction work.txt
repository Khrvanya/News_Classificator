The Fatehgarh Sahib MP, Dr Amar Singh Boparai, and the Amargarh legislator, Surjit Singh Dhiman, inspected various spots to gauge the progress of construction work on the Pohir railway overbridge (ROB) and Jandali railway under bridge (RUB), which join localities situated on eastern and western sides of the Ludhiana-Dhuri railway line passing through the town.
Senior functionaries of the administration, including Sangrur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ramvir Singh and Ahmedgarh SDM Vikramjit Singh Panthey, accompanied public representatives on the occasion.
Event convener Kaamil Amar Singh said office-bearers of the Congress visited various spots to take stock of work at sites of bridges, being constructed for the elimination of level crossings on the Pohir and Jandali roads, besides studying problems related with proposed closure of the Jagera road level crossing for the construction of an under bridge.
Residents are upset over alleged slow pace of work on the Jandali under bridge where level crossing has been closed over seven months. Though the authorities in the Railway Department had announced to close the Jandali road level crossing only for three months, residents had no hope of resumption of vehicular traffic in near future.
As twin projects of the Pohir road ROB and RUB are large, commuters apprehend that it would take long time to complete the construction going by the slow pace of work.
Besides advising the staff on duty to expedite work Dr Boparai and Dhiman urged the DC and the SDM to keep in touch with the authorities concerned so that projects could be completed as soon as possible.
