The leg rub Nas gave Sophie was uncomfortable and unnecessary. I'm sure he didn't do it with creepy intentions, but guys, please don't do that, it's creepy. #loveisland

Is Nas mad rubbing Sophie's leg like that?! She had to make an excuse to walk away. #loveisland

One viewer argued: ‘Guys stop. Nas didn’t come across predatory at all! I am very tactile & comfort people with affection when they’re crying.
‘I’m sure it’d look weird on TV too. Male-female platonic relationships exist. Sophie didn’t seem perturbed. Stop making things weird.’
Another user added: ‘I’m getting nice guy vibes from Nas. The way he was stroking Sophie’s thigh to comfort her.’
Nas went up to the dressing room to comfort a crying Sophie after she clashed with her best friend, Shaugna.

After losing her other half Connor Durman, Sophie had been left vulnerable in the latest elimination.
She left Shaugna suspicious of her motives after pleading with Nas to keep her in the villa – despite his blossoming romance with Demi.
