Before the Russian rouble collapsed in 2014, Russia had contributed to 60 per cent of Food Empire's revenue. But that has since fallen to 40 per cent, mainly due to the coffee maker deepening its presence in other geographical regions such as Indochina, which includes Vietnam.
Café Pho, Food Empire's iced coffee mix product, is among the top five brands by volume share and a top three player by value in Vietnam's 3-in-1 coffee mix market, the analysts wrote.
Revenue from Indochina grew almost four times to US$50.4 million in 2018, from US$10.5 million in 2014. Vietnam is the company's second largest market, contributing almost 18 per cent to its topline.
"We believe Food Empire will be able to continue to gain market share through the introduction of new products, leveraging on its extensive network of distributors and sales representatives in Vietnam," Ms Kaur and Mr Ho noted.
With Food Empire due to report FY2019 earnings later this month, the analysts expect a record year. They forecast the company's compound annual growth rate for FY2019-2021 to be 9.4 per cent.
In November 2019, Food Empire posted a Q3 net profit of US$7.9 million, up 34.4 per cent from the same period a year earlier on sales growth in Russia, Ukraine and Indochina.
