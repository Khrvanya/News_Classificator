THERE was an interesting factoid that we did not have room to mention in our recent piece on the rouble. Though it is still much less valuable than it was a year ago, by some measures it is still very overvalued. The chart below, from Zsolt Darvas of Bruegel, a think-tank, shows the “real effective exchange rate” for four currencies: the rouble, the dollar, the “German euro” and the “Greek euro” (the last two indices adjust the value of the euro for inflation in Germany and Greece). It is indexed to May 2000, the month that Vladimir Putin first became president of Russia.
The real effective exchange adjusts the market exchange rate for inflation. This is an important adjustment. If the exchange rate between two countries is fixed, but their inflation rate is different, then the country with the higher inflation rate will gradually become less competitive. Citizens of the high-inflation country need more units of their currency to buy things at home. So when they sell abroad, they demand more of their domestic currency, which, in other words, pushes up the cost of their exports.
The chart tells a familiar story with Greece and Germany. Leading up to the financial crisis, the Greek real effective exchange rate became very overvalued, whereas the German one remained much lower.
Now take the rouble. During the 2000s the market exchange rate with the dollar barely changed. But inflation in Russia was much higher, partially thanks to “Dutch disease” effects from the country's oil wealth. So the real effective exchange rate appreciated sharply. By the middle of last year, just as the Ukraine crisis was really getting going, it was horribly overvalued. Even with the crash in the currency's value last December, it is still pretty uncompetitive.
