-A jar or a bowl, to store the mixture.
In a bowl or a jar, take coconut oil and smoothen it. You can also heat it if you want. To this, add all the mentioned essential oils and whip it up so that they mix up nicely. You can also use a mixer to prepare this concoction.
Once ready, take this mixture and transfer it into the jar. Secure it and store it in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. The naturally prepared rub can stay well for 5-6 months at a length.
You can use it anytime when you are ill, just the same way as other vapour rubs.
What makes this better than the commercial rubs?
For many with sensitive skin, commercial vapour rubs can be harsh and lead to a reaction. Compared to that, this DIY rub comes packed with natural benefits that suit most skin types.
One main ingredient in this rub is eucalyptus essential oil, which acts as an expectorant, dealing with respiratory issues, opens up the phlegm as well. Plus, it has antimicrobial properties, just like tea tree oil which can get rid of allergens and pollutants adding to your irritation.
Another added benefit is the presence of lemon essential oil, loaded with potent vitamin C, which again comes in super handy while you battle a cold or a cough. Lavender in the mixture can help you sleep better, while peppermint oil, with its helpful antibacterial and pain-relieving properties can act down on any inflammation. It is also added to the market bought concoctions, which provides a cooling effect. Individually, all these added oils carry magical benefits but together, they become a strong antidote for your health problems.
It is always advised to conduct a patch test on the skin to stay on the safer side. Always use trusted, pure essential oils for your body.
Refrain from using large amounts at once. Always use small portions for kids and even lesser if you plan to use it on babies.
