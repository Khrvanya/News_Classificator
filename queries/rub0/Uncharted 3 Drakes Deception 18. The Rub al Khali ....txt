In this Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception guide, we’ll help you find the one treasure in Chapter 18 “The Rub’ al Khali,” part of the PS4’s Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection .
We’ve organized our guides by chapters. To find the chapter name, press the Options button and select Load Game from the pause menu. The name of the current chapter (but not the number) appears on the bottom line of the most recent save in the Load menu.
There’s no map in Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, so for each of the collectibles below, we used photo mode to zoom out and give you some context surrounding the treasure locations. Use the images to make sure you’re in the right area and the added arrows to help you find your way.
Calcite Statue of a Female Figure treasure location.
After the cutscene(s) at the beginning of the chapter, you’ll stumble your way to an old well. It’s the only landmark, so it’s impossible to miss. Shoot the pot on the left side of the well to find the Calcite Statue of a Female Figure.
