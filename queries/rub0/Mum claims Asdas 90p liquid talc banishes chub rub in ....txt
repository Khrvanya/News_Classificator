Speaking in the clip she said: “This little find, it’s an absolute little beauty. It should definitely be called ‘chub rub be gone’.
“It does work, it’s the only thing I’ve found that does work for me, because I’m a bit curvier a bit chunkier on the bottom and summer can be an absolute nightmare.
“So at 89p in Asda, you’re welcome.”
And it seems that she is not the only curvy girl to have benefitted from the baby product.
The Little Angels liquid talc has received praise across the board in the product reviews on the supermarket website.

Agreeing another added: “I mean yes, this works just as well on the little ones.. but my goodness now it's getting warmer.. chub rub and under boobs are finally saved with this miracle rub.”
“Ok, so I know this is meant for babies but I use it on myself too, for chub rub” attested a third.
