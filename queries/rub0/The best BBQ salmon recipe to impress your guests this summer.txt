1kg side of sustainable salmon, descaled and pin-boned
Soak a cedar plank in water, fully submerged, for 30 minutes. Pat dry after removing.
Prepare the grill for indirect cooking. To make the dry rub, combine the brown sugar, chilli powder, cumin, chipotle powder, salt and pepper.
To prepare the salmon, coat with the oil, then sprinkle about 2tbsp of the dry rub over it (you will have some left over, depending on the size of your salmon). Place the salmon on the cedar plank and put it on direct heat for up to 15 minutes or until the salmon reaches an internal temperature of 50C.
Transfer the salmon and plank to indirect heat. Using a silicone brush, glaze the salmon with the maple syrup. Remove after 1 minute. Let rest for 5 minutes, then slice and serve.
Suggested wine pairing: riesling provides a refreshing and sweet contrast to the spicy chipotle flavours. It will also balance the sweetness of the dry rub and maple syrup. For red wine, go for a medium-bodied fruity pinot noir from California .
