Nasdaq has launched a decentralized finance index including crypto assets of projects like 0x, MakerDAO and Augur.
According to a Defix press release published on Sept. 9, brokerage firm Exante streamlined the launch of the index.
Amoveo main developer Zack Hess said:
Exante launched its Bitcoin ( BTC ) fund in 2012. Notably, the fund reportedly totaled an overall return of investment of 70,000% since its inception.
Furthermore, the firm also released the XAI fund, composed of major altcoins including Ether ( ETH ), Ethereum Classic ( ETC ), Monero ( XMR ), XRP and Zcash ( ZEC ).
As Cointelegraph reported at the end of August, Elwood Asset Management — owned by British billionaire and Brevan Howard founder Alan Howard — is planning a $1 billion venture into the crypto hedge fund space.
