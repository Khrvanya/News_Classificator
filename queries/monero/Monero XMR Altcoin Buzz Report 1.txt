It is a private coin forked of Bytecoin in 2014. By private I mean that it hides the sender, receiver and the amount. XMR makes use of a PoW algorithm based on the CryptoNight PoW hash, which comes from the CryptoNode Protocol.
The Monero team is currently working on a project named Kovri. This technology will provide IP anonymity to its transactions.
For those interested, the coin’s supply is 17,066,158 Million coins currently.
Some may say that privacy coins could be a bad thing in the hands of the criminals, however, providing anonymity is a safe place for everyone. We should not concern about criminals because they will always find a way to lose their tracks.

XMR has seen a price spike of around 13% in the last 30 hours (2 Sep. 2019). This move could be related to today’s Research Lab meeting. To keep in mind that the chart indicates the price being at its bottom. I believe that XMR is currently trading at a good price (not financial advice, just sharing my own opinion).
