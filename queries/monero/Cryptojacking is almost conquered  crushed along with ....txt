So, where do these new scripts come from? The researchers found them linking back to eight distinct domains with names like hashing.win and webminepool.com. Searching on the eight domains surfaced 632 websites using their scripts. By far the most popular was minero.cc.
Browser-based cryptominers often seek out certain online properties like movie streaming sites to help ensure that victims stay connected, the paper said. However, they can use tricks like hidden pop-under windows to maintain a connection even after the user closes a browser tab, and technologies like WebSockets, WebWorkers and WebAssembly to make connections more robust and take direct advantage of client hardware.
Cryptojacking did not end after Coinhive shut down. It is still alive but not as appealing as it was before. It became less attractive not only because Coinhive discontinued their service, but also because it became a less lucrative source of income for website owners. For most of the sites, ads are still more profitable than mining.
Will browser-based cryptojacking stay suppressed? A lot depends on its profitability. Should Monero or some other cryptojacking-friendly currency grow sufficiently in value, there will doubtless be another rush to capitalise on it.
This study didnâ€™t look at server-side cryptojacking. This has been a scourge for companies like Tesla, which saw cryptojacking hackers compromise its cloud-based servers in early 2018. Something similar happened to the LA Times . The advantage in those attacks is that the servers keep mining, whereas a home user may shut down their laptop or desktop at the end of the day.
