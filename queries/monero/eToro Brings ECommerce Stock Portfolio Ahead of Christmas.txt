Multi-asset stock platform eToro on Wednesday has launched an investment portfolio with stocks of leading global e-commerce giants.
Dubbed shopping cart portfolio, the product has been brought ahead of Christmas and New Year when a significant increase in the sales on these platforms is expected.
As detailed in the announcement, the portfolio consists of 25 stocks of global e-commerce brands, including Amazon, Alibaba, JD.com, and eBay. The total market capitalization of the companies exceeds $1.9 trillion.
Commenting on the new investment portfolio, Yoni Assia, co-founder, and CEO of the platform, said: “We believe that the most successful investors are those who invest in their passions and that’s why we have launched the shopping cart portfolio. Retail is one of the world’s leading sectors, with the industry worth more than £20 trillion, meaning there are plenty of opportunities for investors to make money.”
