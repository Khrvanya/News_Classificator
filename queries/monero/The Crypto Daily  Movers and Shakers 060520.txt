In spite of the rebound, Bitcoin failed to break back through the first major resistance level.
The near-term bearish trend, formed at late June 2019’s swing hi $13,764.0, remained firmly intact, reaffirmed by the March swing lo $4,000.
For the bulls, Bitcoin would need to break out from $10,000 levels to form a near-term bullish trend.

Bitcoin would need to move through to $8,970 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $9,177.07 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Tuesday’s high $9,124.8.
Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, resistance at $9,100 would likely leave Bitcoin short of the first major resistance level.
In the event of another breakout, the second major resistance level at $9,334.03 could come into play.
Failure to move through to $8,970 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red.
A fall through the morning low $8,913.6 would bring the first major support level at $8,810.87 into play before any recovery.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should well clear of the second major support level at $8,601.63.
