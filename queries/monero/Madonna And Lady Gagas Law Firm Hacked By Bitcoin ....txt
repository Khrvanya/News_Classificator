A recent report indicated that the hacker group known as REvil (or Sodinokibi) had attacked the website of a New York-based law firm representing famous individuals such as Sir Elton John, Madonna, and Lady Gaga.
Interestingly, the group recently announced switching from Bitcoin to Monero as the primary method of ransom payments.
The BBC report revealed that REvil has taken down the website of the New York law firm called Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. The group claimed to have taken over 750 gigabytes of data, including contracts and personal emails.
“We can confirm that we have been victimized by a cyber-attack. We have notified our clients and our staff. We have hired the world’s experts who specialize in this area, and we are working around the clock to address these matters.” – reads a press statement from the law firm.
At the time of this writing, the company’s website is still displaying only the firm’s logo. The cybercriminals had released a screenshot allegedly containing Madonna’s contract.  Other well-known clients of the firm include Rob Stewart, The Weeknd, U2, LeBron James, Mike Tyson, Robert De Niro, and Sony Corp.
According to Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, the number of such ransomware attacks is increasing lately, which is particularly concerning.
