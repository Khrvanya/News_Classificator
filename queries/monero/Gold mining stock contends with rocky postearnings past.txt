Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is up 4.7%  at $7.99 today, as investors anticipate  the copper mining concern's  first-quarter earnings report, due out before the open tomorrow, April 24. It's  been a rocky week for commodities, as Wall Street nervously eyes mining stocks  amid oil's historically devastating plummet. Despite this turbulence, however  FCX has found solid support at its intersecting 20- and 30-day moving average,  and is up 16% this quarter.
The  stock has captured the attention of options bears today, with 22,000 puts  exchanged so far -- 1.8 times the intraday average -- compared to 13,000 calls.  The most popular contract by far is the monthly June 8 put, followed by the  weekly 4/24 8-strike call.
These  bearish bets had been picking up steam in the options pits prior to today. This  is per FCX's 10-day put/call volume ratio of 0.73 at the International  Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  (PHLX), which sits higher than 98% of all other readings from the past 12  months. This means that while calls are still outnumbering puts on an overall  basis, options traders' appetite for the latter is unusually high right  now.
On  the other hand, the brokerage bunch is still quite optimistic, with 10 of the  14 covering Freeport-McMoRan calling it a "strong buy," and not a  single "sell" to be seen. Additionally, the consensus 12-month price  target of $11.60 is a lofty 44.8% premium to current levels.
History,  meanwhile, doesn't bode well for FCX ahead of tomorrow's report. In the past  two years, the security suffered negative next-day returns 75% of the time,  including a 13.1% nosedive back in January 2019. This time around, the options  pits are pricing in a post-earnings move of 12%, which is almost double the  6.8% swing FCX averaged after these past eight report, regardless of  direction.
Despite  the high implied volatility environment heading into earnings, the equity's  Schaeffer’s Volatility Index (SVI) of 90% is in the 30th percentile of its  annual range, suggesting options have been pricing in relatively low volatility  expectations right now. Plus, FCX's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) sits  high at 94 (out of 100), showing that the stock has tended to exceed option  traders' volatility expectations during the past year, a good thing for option  buyers.
