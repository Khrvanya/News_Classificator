In fact, Japan-based DeCurret is currently exploring a new digital currency payment system for the East Japan Railway Company (JR East); a significant investor in the firm. The new system being suggested by DeCurret will allow the Suica payment card issued by the railway firm to be credited using virtual assets. As of March last year, roughly 70 million Suica cards were in use in Japan.
Despite the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) allowing DeCurret to operate in the country as a registered crypto exchange since it opened business back in April last year, the firm may soon have to deal with new regulatory concerns.
The new laws affecting the cryptocurrency space in Japan will take effect beginning next month. The new Payments Services Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which were passed by the Japan House of Representatives back in 2019, will be enforced beginning next month.
