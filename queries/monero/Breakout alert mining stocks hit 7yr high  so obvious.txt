It doesn’t get ANY BETTER than this. The GDX,  which is our FAVORITE  Gold Miners ETF, is trading at a 52-week high, as well as BREAKING OUT above its 2016 high. In fact, it is trading at 7-YR HIGHS right now!
As we've been writing for years, GDX is the  SIMPLEST, easiest and SUREST way to gain leverage and to BET on higher gold  prices, without picking individual companies. It's the DOW JONES equivalent of  the gold mining sector.
Since gold bottomed in December 2015, the spot price  has risen by 63.6%, from  its low of $1,053/ounce.
If you factor in what it actually costs to buy a  gold coin at your local shop or get it delivered to your house, gold is at an  ALL-TIME HIGH ALREADY!
Meanwhile, GDX is up by 146%, OUTPERFORMING both the  physical metal and the S&P 500. Owning the ETF has been a SURE-FIRE way to  make a killing and we've been  writing about it for years.
The global economy is GETTING DESTROYED right now:  Supply chains, the entire financial system, and international trade ON ALL  LEVELS are all being disrupted.
The central banks are going to be spitting out  cash , governments will be borrowing, and there will be rampant  defaults.
Much of the emerging markets are commodity-based,  with many of them oil-based, so you can see just how ugly this is going to get  for the world.
The most obvious trade, PERHAPS EVER, is going to be  gold, according to Bank of America, Ray Dalio, Paul Singer, Paul Tudor Jones  and Raoul Pal.
If gold doesn’t go up over the next 1 to 5 years, something TERRIBLY WRONG here.
It's the BEST ASSET you can own right now, in my  opinion.
Mining shares historically outperform gold in a  HEALTHY gold bull market. When gold REALLY RALLIES, junior mining shares  outperform the large-caps and the physical metals BY MILES!
None of us has ever FACED a situation in which our  profession is SUSPENDED, while other businesses are able to FUNCTION properly  and grow even bigger; it's an UNFAIR money heist, a government-led BUSINESS BANKRUPTCY operation.
Around the globe, people are getting frustrated, mad and they're ready to  take it to the streets.
Parents are scrambling to find ways to feed their  children. Millions of renters and mortgage-payers are not able to MEET OBLIGATIONS.
This is draining people of their zest and vitality – they are being pushed TO  THE EDGE!
It's one of the TOUGHEST, most challenging realities that the developed  world has ever been through. Families are hurting.
There's NO PLAYBOOK for what's happening, at the moment. CEOs are engaged in  SURVIVAL.
This is a depression. The Federal Reserve indices are showing it and WE ALL  FEEL it.
Income levels are down, liquidity in the market is DRIED-UP altogether, and  businesses are closed every which way. Our way of life has COMPLETELY CHANGED  and now we'll go through a PAINFUL re-opening.
I expect the next 18 months to be ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL for most.
Personally, I'm taking this period and making it a LEARNING OPPORTUNITY, a way  to re-assess my priorities and my mission in life.
My daily routine always begins with going over my PRIMARY LIFE  PRINCIPLES.
No matter how I size things up, this is A WEIRD depression, since we FORCED  it into existence with our own hands.
Therefore, many COMPARISONS to previous meltdowns won't hold up.
None of us has lived through a period of time when seeing family and friends  was FROWNED UPON, when producing value and servicing clients was forbidden or  restricted, and when parents were responsible for their children all day long,  instead of the government education board.
Hundreds of millions, even billions of individuals, now look to their  governments for help.
Governments have TAKEN OVER and we have to learn how to ADAPT.
All of the FED branches are PUBLISHING distressed economic conditions.
We live in a mad reality.
