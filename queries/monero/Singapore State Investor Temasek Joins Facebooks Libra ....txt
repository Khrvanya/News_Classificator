"Our participation in the Libra Association as a member will allow us to contribute toward a regulated global network for cost effective retail payments," Temasek International Deputy Chief Executive Officer Chia Song Hwee said in a statement, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. "Many developments in the space excite us. We look forward to further exploring the potential of the technology."
Libra was formally announced by Facebook in June last year but has faced significant regulatory challenges in the United States and worldwide.
Multiple companies, including PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL ), Visa Inc. (NYSE: V ), Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA ), and eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY), joined and left over the course of the year. The Libra association is looking to revamp the project , including creating stable cryptocurrencies pegged to different fiat currencies, instead of just the Libra coin, with an intended initial launch this year.
Facebook shares closed 0.8% higher at $206.81 on Thursday and added another 0.2% in the after-hours, at $207.28.
