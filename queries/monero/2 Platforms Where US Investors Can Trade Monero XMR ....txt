These trading platforms offer a way for retail investors to buy and sell crypto with zero fees.
Zero-fee trading has been taking traditional equity markets by storm, as major brokerage firms adopt the model to stay competitive. While this is quickly becoming the standard for stock trading, most crypto exchanges rely on fees, and brokerage firms are still few and far between.
Given that American investors are blocked from using many of the top global crypto exchanges, it’s especially difficult to find a platform appropriate for one’s trading volume.
Here are 2 trading platforms available to US investors with zero-fee trading:
Robinhood : The OG of zero-fee trading, Robinhood offers a sleek interface that allows users to trade crypto side-by-side with stocks and options. The platform offers 17 cryptocurrencies including Monero ( XMR ) for trading, however, users can’t currently withdraw their holdings. Robinhood does plan to add the feature in the future, though. New users receive a free stock for signing up.
Voyager : This rapidly growing app has a leadership team from eTrade and Uber and offers commission-free trading for over 30 digital assets including XMR. Recent updates to the app added limit orders for all listings and monthly interest for holding BTC and Voyager Token, the brokerage’s newly rebranded token. New users can earn $25 in BTC by signing up for the app through this link and trading $100 (or use code: SLUDGE25).
