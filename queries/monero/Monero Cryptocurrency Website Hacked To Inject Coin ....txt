GetMonero.org, the official website of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero was hacked to inject coin stealing malware on the systems of the people who were downloading the Morero wallet.
This comes after a number of users reported that the hashes of the CLI [Command Line Interface] binaries downloaded from the website in order to set up the Monero wallet were different from the hashes listed on the official website.
On Tuesday, a core team member of GetMonero confirmed the existence of mismatching hashes on Reddit and pointed out the possibility of a CLI binaries hack. Yesterday, Getmonero.org released out an advisory saying: “CLI wallet had been compromised and a malicious version was being served.”
In the post, the Monero official website claimed the attack lasted for an extremely short period, “between Monday 18th, 2:30 AM UTC and 4:30 PM UTC“, and the problem was fixed immediately.
However, it is recommended for all Monero users to check the hashes of their binaries downloaded in the last 24 hours.
“If they don’t match the official ones, delete the files and download them again. Do not run the compromised binaries for any reason.” writes GetMonero.
Since the incident, a Reddit user reported $7000 worth of Monero coins were stolen from his wallet after downloading the infected binaries.
“I ran the binary, a single transaction drained my wallet of all $7000. I downloaded the build yesterday around 6 pm Pacific Time.” the Reddit user wrote.
On the basis of extremely few reports, it is safe to assume that not a large number of users were affected, possibly because of the small window during which the Monero’s website was compromised.
Meanwhile, a number of Reddit and Twitter users are disappointed with the core team for failing to inform users on time. Interestingly, users started posting on Reddit about the hash mismatch a day prior to the GetMonero’s Reddit post.
