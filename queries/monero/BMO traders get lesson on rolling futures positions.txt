Events in the gold and crude-oil markets in recent weeks taught  speculators to pay attention to important dates for futures contracts and not  to wait to long to roll forward positions, said BMO Capital Markets. Most  speculators do not want to take delivery of any commodity, so ahead of  first-notice day, either exit or roll their positions from a nearby contract to  one further into the future. “If there is one key thing to take  away from the last few weeks in commodity markets, it is to understand contract  expiry dates for those with physical delivery against positions,” BMO said. “In gold , we saw a lack of appropriate gold bars to deliver  into the March contract expiry, leading to a strong futures premium over  physical prices. In WTI [West Texas Intermediate] oil yesterday  we saw the opposite with physical delivery slots fully allocated for May  delivery, pushing prices into negative territory. The key lesson from oil is  not to wait too long to roll positions in heavy contango markets.”
