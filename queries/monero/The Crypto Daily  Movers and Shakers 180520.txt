The near-term bearish trend, formed at late June 2019’s swing hi $13,764.0, remained firmly intact, reaffirmed by the March swing lo $4,000.
For the bulls, Bitcoin would need to break out from $10,000 levels to form a near-term bullish trend.

Binance Coin (+1.31), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.90%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.12%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.41%), Litecoin (+1.11%), Ripple’s XRP (+0.79%), Stellar’s Lumen (+1.51%), and Tron’s TRX (+0.34%) also saw green.

Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Elsewhere, it was also a bullish start to the day for the majors. Binance Coin led the way early on, with a 1.51% gain.
Bitcoin would need to avoid sub-$9,630 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $9,924.57 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Sunday’s high $9,883.5.
Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside.
In the event of rebound, the 62% FIB of $10,034 and the second major resistance level at $10,180.93 would likely come into play.
Failure to avoid sub-$9,630 levels could see Bitcoin struggle at the start of the week.
A fall back through to sub-$9,600 levels would bring the first major support level at $9,370.77 into play.
Barring a crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$9,000 levels. The second major support level at $9,073.33 would likely limit any downside.
