However, an anonymous Twitter user @BTCKING555 popular for leaking insider information aboutÂ leading mining companiesÂ did not seem amused by the noble efforts of fighting the coronavirus, blaming the firm of â€˜pumpingâ€™ its stocks.

Formerly, Northern Data AG was known as â€˜Northern Bitcoin AGâ€™ prior to changing its name in January 2020. The name was changed because of its merger with the Whinstone US. Somehow, on Business Insider, the Northern Data has now been listed as a biopharmaceutical firm.
Northern Data AG is a Germany-based information technology and Bitcoin mining company that provides expert HPC-solutions.
