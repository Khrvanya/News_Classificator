The Crypto Daily – Movers and Shakers – June 29th, 2020
Bitcoin rose by 1.23% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 1.72% fall from Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week down by 1.87% to $9,125.4.
It was a mixed start to the day for Bitcoin. In the early hours, Bitcoin fell to an early morning intraday low $8,946.6 before finding support.
Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $8,900 and the first major support level at $8,846.03, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $9,193.2.
Coming up against the first major resistance level at $9,193.53, Bitcoin fell back to sub-$9,100 levels.
Finding late support, however, Bitcoin recovered to $9,100 levels ahead of the day end.
The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the recent pullback to sub-$9,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend.
Across the rest of the majors, it was also a bullish day on Saturday.
Bitcoin Cash ABC and Cardano’s ADA led the way, with gains of 4.22% and 3.82% respectively.
Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.92%), Stellar’s Lumen (+2.39%), and Tezos (+2.16%) also found strong support.
Binance Coin (+1.79%), EOS (+1.56%), Ethereum (+1.82%), Monero’s XMR (+1.82%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.07%), and Tron’s TRX (+1.94%) trailed the front runners.

For the week, it was mixed, with Cardano’s ADA rising by 2.36% to buck the trend.

It was a bullish start to the day for the rest of the majors.
Cardano’s ADA led the way with a 1.66% gain.
Bitcoin would avoid a fall through the $9,090 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $9,230.2.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Sunday’s high $9,193.2.
Barring an extended crypto rebound, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high would likely cap any upside.
In the event of a crypto breakout, Bitcoin could test the second major resistance level at $9,335.0.
Failure to avoid a fall through the $9,090 pivot level could see Bitcoin struggle later in the day.
A fall back through to sub-$9,000 would bring the first major support level at $8,983.6 into play.
In the event of another extended crypto sell-off, the 23.6% FIB of $8,900 and the second major support level at $8,841.8 may be tested.
