You probably know the basic Elliott wave sequence: 5 waves in the direction of the larger trend, and 3 waves against it.

Watch our monthly Global Market Perspective contributor, Brian Whitmer, show you a developing corrective pattern in European stocks -- and explain its implications.
It's a great chance to brush up on your Elliott wave skills -- and learn what's next for the pan-European Stoxx 50 index.
