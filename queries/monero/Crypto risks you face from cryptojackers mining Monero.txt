Researcher Vladislav Hrčka of ESET explained that since strings used in a function are compiled sequentially. The entry points of the said functions can be copied to extract the sequences of printable characters to obtain the string. To hide their digital footprints, these offenders add dead code to obscure their tracks.
The botnet used for these crimes generally operates in Ukraine and Russia. In the previous year, the makers of the botnet made some changes that added the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) to it. This was purely done to generate more money. Before this, the botnet depended on promotion frauds and credential theft for money.
Monero cryptocurrency has been a vital source of income for these bad actors for years. More than 4 percent of the said cryptocurrency’s total supply in circulation is illicitly mined.
