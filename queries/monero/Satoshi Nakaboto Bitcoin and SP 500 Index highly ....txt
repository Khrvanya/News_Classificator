Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin $BTC▲4.15% every fucking day.
Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Sloterdijk used to say: Time to learn some stuff about Bitcoin!
We closed the day, March 30 2020, at a price of $6,429. That’s a decent 8.51 percent increase in 24 hours, or $504. It was the highest closing price in two days.
Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $117,640,143,688. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.
Yesterday’s volume of $37,101,651,525 was the highest in four days, 79 percent above last year’s average, and 49 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 718 tons of gold.
A total of 276,681 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 14 percent below last year’s average and 38 percent below last year’s high.
Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.20. That’s $3.51 below last year’s high of $3.71.
As of now, there are 10,068 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.8 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.2 percent, and the top 1000 35.2 percent.

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicte d that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.
He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 97.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin’s price should have been $263,716 by now, according to dickline.info.
Bitcoin used an estimated 192 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 70 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Colombia’s energy consumption or 6,5 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.
