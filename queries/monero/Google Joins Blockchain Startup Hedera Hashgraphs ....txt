All members of the governing council participate equally in approving updates to Hedera’s codebase as well as for making policies for the nodes that constitute Hedera’s blockchain network.
Hedera Hashgraph was launched in September 2019 and claimed to process up to 10,000 transactions per second, which is faster than most current blockchains .
