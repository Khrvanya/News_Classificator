Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, added Monero [XMR] to its Futures market. Binance Futures announced the launch of XMR/USDT perpetual contract today. This update comes just weeks after the exchange announced that Stellar Lumens [XLM] paired with USDT perpetual contracts would be supported on Binance Futures.
In the announcement , the company stated that the XMR/ USDT perpetual contracts will begin trading on 3 Feb 2020 from 08:00 AM (UTC) and users will be able to select the leverage they want ranging from a minimum of 1x up to a maximum of 75x.
Binance also said, “To prevent market manipulation, Binance will implement a pricing limit of ±1% on the mark price within the first 15 minutes after trading starts.” This measure was also implemented when the XLM /USDT perpetual contracts began to trade.
