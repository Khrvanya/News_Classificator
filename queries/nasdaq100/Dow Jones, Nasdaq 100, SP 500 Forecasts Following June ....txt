After leaving the Federal Funds Rate unchanged, Chairman Powell offered a series of dovish remarks
The Federal Open Market Committee announced it would leave the Federal Funds Rate unchanged at 0.0 percent to 0.25 percent at its June 10 meeting, aligning with market expectations. Subsequent remarks from Chairman Powell, however, struck a slightly more dovish tone than I suspect most market participants were expecting, and the surprise could translate to further gains for the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 down the line.
Earlier this week the Nasdaq 100 registered a fresh record high as it broke above 10,000 for the first time in history, a feat many attributed to the accommodative policy from the Federal Reserve. To be sure, Chairman Powell’s remarks would suggest balance sheet expansion and low interest rates are here to stay, at least until the economy returns nearer pre-covid levels.
Massive unemployment, economic uncertainty and stubbornly subdued inflation are all reasons the Fed evidenced for opting into sustaining “easier” monetary policy, and that continuation may spillover into the three major US indices. As I noted in my webinar, the technical outlook for each of the indices looks encouraging and the comments from Chairman Powell have undoubtedly eased concerns on the fundamental side – in the short and medium terms at least – as longer-term concerns will remain a topic of discussion.
