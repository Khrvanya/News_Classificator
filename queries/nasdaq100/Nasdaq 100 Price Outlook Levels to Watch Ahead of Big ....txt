Trading near the lower bound of an ascending channel, negative results could prompt a move lower
The Nasdaq 100 has been the best performing index of the three major US baskets and it has reclaimed much of what it had lost in the coronavirus crash as a result. Now, however, the tech-heavy index will have to weather a string of earnings from its most influential components. For only the third time ever, according to Bloomberg, the five largest stocks of the S&P 500 will report their quarterly findings in the same week.
These five stocks, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google, are also the five largest stocks on the Nasdaq 100 and have been a major area of strength for the broader US indices. In total, the five stocks account for roughly 45% of the Nasdaq 100 and each of them – like all other stocks at the moment – has a highly uncertain future. Therefore, earnings season will provide investors valuable insight with which they can use to conclude whether the degree of outperformance witnessed in recent weeks was warranted or entirely unfounded.
