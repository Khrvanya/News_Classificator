As quarantine restrictions begin to ease, may look to target overhead resistance if risk trends allow
The Nasdaq 100 continues to show strength in comparison to other stock markets, even its Dow Jones and S&P 500 counterparts. Still, the tech-heavy index is not out of the woods and although quarantine restrictions appear to be easing in some parts of the country, further gains will have to negotiate a looming non-farm payrolls report.
As it stands, many Federal Reserve officials – including Chairman Jerome Powell – have warned that the upcoming data release may reveal an unemployment rate well into the double digits. White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett issued a more specific projection, saying April unemployment will be “north of 16%.”
Whatever the eventual figure is, it appears analysts, advisers and policymakers are expecting an unparalleled increase in unemployment. As initial jobless claims have shown in recent weeks, the coronavirus has been a formidable threat to many industries which has resulted in more than 20 million Americans losing their jobs in just a matter of weeks. By comparison, about 9 million Americans lost their job during the Great Financial Crisis according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Therefore, the coming jobs report may well shatter previous records – but this has become the norm.
