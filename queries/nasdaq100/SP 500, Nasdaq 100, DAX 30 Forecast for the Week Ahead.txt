The DAX 30 will look to upcoming retail sales, inflation and growth data
A recent deterioration in US-China relations spilled into the stock market last week after the US Senate passed a bill that would require additional oversight for Chinese stocks listed on US exchanges. The crux of the possible legislature is a stipulation that would require Chinese companies to delist from the likes of the Nasdaq 100 or other US exchanges if certain requirements are not met in a given time period. As a result, Chinese stocks like Alibaba and Baidu fell under pressure while the FXI ETF – a basket of Chinese companies on US exchanges – also declined.
While the immediate reaction was somewhat measured, the buildup in tensions between the world’s two largest economies may linger and tensions have already flared in other arenas like human rights. Evidently, it seems the two economic powerhouses are once again posturing for another round of strongly worded statements and tit-for-tat actions. As it stands the US has fired the first volley, although this time it is accompanied by other G7 nations – at least in spirit – as it looks to pressure China into changing its method of operations.
