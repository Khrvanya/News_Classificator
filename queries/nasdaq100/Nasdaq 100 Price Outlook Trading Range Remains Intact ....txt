After trading within an ascending channel since mid-April, a break would be a significant development
The S&P 500 crossed the 3,000 mark on Tuesday, trading above the level for the first time since March 6 and achieving a significant technical benchmark. That said, the Nasdaq 100 stands in a class of its own as the tech-heavy index looks to retake all-time highs which exist just a few hundred points from the current price. Thus, it seems the Nasdaq 100 is in a strong position to make an attempt at the prior peaks in the weeks ahead as long as the ascending channel remains intact.
As it stands, risk appetite appears to reign supreme, but recent developments in Hong Kong threaten to undermine sentiment. Still, prior highs established earlier this week may prove to be first barrier in a renewed attempt higher. The level roughly coincides with the top of the channel, so the area may provide notable resistance before the Nasdaq 100 can look to target record levels around 9,752.
