Shares of city gas distribution (CGD) companies have declined by 23-33% from their highs this year. CGD companies include Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) and Gujarat Gas Ltd.
True, the lockdown will affect volumes of many sectors as economic activity has collapsed and CGD companies are no exception. But analysts expect demand to bounce back relatively sooner for these companies once the lockdown is lifted as vehicles start hitting the road. Note that demand recovery from some industry categories is expected to be slower.
Another positive is lower input costs, which can act as a cushion for lower volumes and profitability. Additionally, the domestic piped natural gas (PNG) segment is not affected by the lockdown. However, the segment accounts for a small proportion of volumes of these companies and doesn’t move the needle meaningfully.
Nitin Tiwari, analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd, wrote in a report on 1 April, “The CGD sector catering to automobile-CNG is likely to be worst hit in the ensuing nationwide lockdown as lost time-kilometres cannot be compensated for."
IGL and MGL have a high proportion of compressed natural gas (CNG) sales in their overall sales portfolio. In comparison, Gujarat Gas has a high share of industrial volume in its mix.
The outlook for industrial gas sales is mixed. On the one hand, manufacturing units would eventually resume production post-lockdown and try and fulfil existing order books. But a demand hit in the industrial sector could play spoilsport for CGD firms as well.
Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, there is relief on the costs front and that augurs well for margins. Domestic gas prices have been revised downwards by 26% to $2.39 per million British thermal units for the half-year ending September 2020. This is the second consecutive gas price cut.
Analysts at Sharekhan Ltd wrote in a report on 1 April, “CGD companies such as IGL and MGL with a high exposure to CNG and domestic PNG will benefit the most given potential for margin expansion from low gas costs and improved competitiveness of CNG versus petrol."
The brokerage firm also expects crude-linked contracted LNG (liquefied natural gas) prices to decline given the sharp fall in crude oil prices by 50-55% in the last one month and thus benefit firms such as Gujarat Gas that have a higher share of industrial gas volume.
According to Bloomberg data, stocks of IGL, MGL and Gujarat Gas trade at about 20 times, 10 times and 14 times FY21 earnings, respectively. As of now, valuations don’t appear demanding.
