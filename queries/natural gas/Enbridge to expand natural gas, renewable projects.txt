Enbridge to expand natural gas, renewable projects
Enbridge Inc., the largest pipeline company in North America, intends to shift its asset mix to boost natural gas and renewables, Kallanish Energy has learned.
The company intends to invest increasingly larger proportions of its capital in natural gas and renewables, as consumers demand lower-carbon forms of energy and as the energy industry transitions, CEO Al Monaco told the Financial Post in an interview.
The company will continue to invest in liquid pipelines, he said.
“We think having a diversified approach, having a gradual approach to the transition through natural gas and renewables makes a lot of sense,” Monaco told the media outlet.
At present, 55% of Enbridge’s earnings come from its liquid pipelines, 40% from natural gas transmission, and storage and 4% from renewables, mostly offshore wind projects in the U.K. and Germany.
Its Mainline pipeline system transports 2.9 million barrels per day from western Canada to refineries in the East and Midwest.
It is also investing in offshore wind in France.
Monaco said Europe currently has a better supply chain and more attractive power purchase agreements for offshore wind than North America and that is appealing to Enbridge.
Adding natural gas and renewables will require investing billions of dollars in capital projects in the coming years, said the company with headquarters in Calgary, Alberta.
The International Energy Agency is projecting rapid growth globally in natural gas and renewables and a gradual decline in oil consumption.
