GRANVILLE — The Ohio Oil and Gas Energy Education Program has awarded scholarships to 54 students, representing 30 counties across Ohio, 20 different colleges and more than a dozen energy-related majors.
“It’s encouraging to see so many talented young people excited to work in the energy industry,” said Greg Mason, OOGEEP’s interim executive director. “These students are our future leaders, and we are eager to see the innovative solutions and new perspectives they bring.”
The organization’s scholarship awards are reserved for Ohio residents or students enrolled in a college or technical college program within the state. Recipient students maintain an above-average GPA, are actively involved in school and community extracurriculars and plan to pursue a career in the natural gas and oil industry.
In Jefferson County, the 2020 recipient is Sadie Carducci of Steubenville, who plans to study chemical and petroleum engineering in the fall at the University of Pittsburgh.
In Harrison County, the 2020 recipients include Zachary Oboy of Bowerston, who plans to attend Baldwin Wallace University in the fall and study digital marketing; and Payton Taylor of Hopedale, a rising sophomore at the University of Akron who is studying chemical engineering.
Students submitted multiple letters of recommendation and a written essay describing their personal career goals and particular interest in the field. Each $1,000 scholarship renews annually during a four-year period.
Since its inception in 2007, the OOGEEP scholarship program has provided more than 500 scholarships to students from more than 60 counties in the state and attending 52 different colleges and universities in Ohio.
