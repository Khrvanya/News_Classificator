Many events have helped show appreciation for essential workers, from those in the medical field to those who deliver packages, stock grocery shelves or prepare food in restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic.
Texans for Natural Gas decided it was time to thank the essential workers in the oil patch who are responsible for producing the energy that powers medical devices and kitchens. So, the group hired a plane to fly over Midland-Odessa Monday afternoon with a banner thanking oilfield workers.
“We wanted to do something big, and what’s bigger than an airplane with a banner?” said Elizabeth Caldwell, spokeswoman for the grassroots organization that advocates for oil and natural gas.
“The reason we decided to undertake this is, we saw how essential workers across Texas and the U.S. were being thanked,” she said in a phone interview. “We wanted to thank our oil and gas essential workers and make them feel appreciated. Like any essential worker, oil and gas workers are putting themselves on the line to keep energy flowing.”
She said that’s important as more people work from home, using more electricity for things such as WiFi, heating and cooling, and more transportation fuels are used for increased deliveries, she said.
This is the first time the group has done this, and while other producing regions in Texas could appreciate the banner, it was flown only over Midland-Odessa, Caldwell said.
“The oil and gas industry is going through incredibly tough times right now, but I’m confident the industry will recover. It’s resilient; oilfield workers are resilient. It’s tough going, but roughnecks are even tougher,” Caldwell said.
The banner featured several hundred signatures, affixed to the banner in the shape of Texas, that the group had gathered online.
