    The EIA projected coronavirus lockdowns will cut U.S. gas use - not including exports - to an
average of 83.8 bcfd in 2020 and 81.2 bcfd in 2021 from a record 85.0 bcfd in 2019.
    With the weather expected to turn milder, Refinitiv projected demand in the Lower 48 states,
including exports, would fall from an average of 86.4 bcfd this week to 81.6 bcfd next week. That is
lower than Refinitiv's demand forecasts on Friday of 87.4 bcfd this week and 82.7 bcfd next week.
    Even though the coronavirus is reducing global gas use, the EIA still expects U.S. exports to hit
record highs in coming years as more LNG export plants and pipelines enter service. Still, the agency
has reduced its projections on the pace of that growth due to the pandemic.
    Refinitiv said U.S. LNG exports have averaged 7.3 bcfd so far in May, down from a four-month low of
8.1 bcfd in April and an all-time high of 8.7 bcfd in February.
