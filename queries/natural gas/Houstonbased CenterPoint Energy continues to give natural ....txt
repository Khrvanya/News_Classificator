CenterPoint Energy continues to suspend disconnections of natural gas service for nonpayment during the coronavirus crisis.
The assistance will help thousands of struggling residents who've lost their jobs or have had their pay cut because of the economic fallout of the pandemic.Â Another program was launched in Texas last week to help out-of-work residents in the deregulated parts of the state cover a portion of their electricity bills.
Residential and small business customers of CenterPoint who can't pay their bills should contact the company to discuss payment assistance or extensions for the balance owed, company spokeswoman Alicia Dixon said. Customers can call the number on their CenterPoint gas bill or visit the company's website.
CenterPoint initially announced it was suspending disconnections on March 16 as part of a broader plan to protect customers and employees of the spread of coronavirus.
CenterPoint did not say how many suspensions it has averted so far with the measure. There is currently no end date to the suspension of cancellations.
CenterPoint is a regulated utility that provides natural gas service to 1.4 million customers in the Houston area.
