Oil futures end higher as U.S. supply marks biggest weekly decline of the year
EIA reports a 7.2 million-barrel weekly drop in U.S. crude stockpiles
Oil futures ended higher Wednesday after a U.S. government report showed the largest weekly decline in domestic crude inventories so far this year.
“Refining activity above 14 million barrels per day for the first time since late March, [and] combined with a drop in imports and exports holding above three million barrels per day, has led to the largest crude inventory draw of the year so far,” Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, told MarketWatch.
The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.2 million barrels for the week ended June 26. That followed three consecutive weeks of increases.
Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts had forecast an average crude supply decline of 2.7 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a fall of 8.2 million barrels. The EIA data also showed crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub edged down by about 200,000 barrels for the week.
The decrease in U.S. supplies has injected some optimism in crude markets, which have been whipsawed by anxieties around the growing spread of COVID-19 and the impact of the contagion on crude demand.
On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate crude for August CLQ20,
rose 55 cents, or 1.4%, to settle at $39.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
For the first half of the year, prices based on the front-month contracts, were nearly 36% lower, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the second quarter, however, prices rose nearly 92%.
