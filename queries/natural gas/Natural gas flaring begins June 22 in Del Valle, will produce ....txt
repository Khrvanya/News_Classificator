DEL VALLE, Texas (KXAN) — Atmos Energy says it’ll have crews and contractors overseeing natural gas flaring for about a week in Del Valle starting June 22.
Atmos Energy says the process will result in a large, controlled flame that will make “moderate” noise. Flaring removes natural gas from a section of a line so crews can work on the line safely, the energy company says.
The work will be from 7 a.m.-4 p.m. June 22-29 at 7211 Farm to Market Road 973, which is just south of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and west of State Highway 130.
The Austin Fire Department, Travis County Sheriff’s Office and local dispatch offices have been notified, the energy company says.
