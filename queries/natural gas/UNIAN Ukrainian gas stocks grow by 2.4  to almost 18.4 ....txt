The biogas plant in the town of Rokytne in southern Kyiv Oblasts generates annually 2.25 megawatts of electricity. Overall, the amount of biogas from Ukraine's agricultural sector alone potentially could cover almost six percent of the electricity consumption in the country, according to the State Agency on Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving of Ukraine.
