Japan has been the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer for a very long time. Since U.S. LNG exports from shale started in February 2016, Japan has been its third largest importer, after South Korea and Mexico (Figure). U.S. LNG from Alaska to Japan though stretches back to 1969. The U.S. is set to become the world’s largest LNG seller within four years.
On the surface, the upside for U.S. LNG to reach Japan seems limited. Japan is a saturated energy market with at best slow growing needs. Japan’s population is in “ rapid decline .” Japan’s nuclear restart program and move back to more coal would expectedly lower the need for LNG . In fact, China is now slated to surpass Japan as the world’s largest LNG importer sooner than realized .
Yet, Japan will remain a vital market for U.S. LNG, as existing contracts expire over the next decade. As an island nation long driven by energy security concerns, Japanese buyers have been leading in contract innovation. Japan’s “ JERA cuts destination clause in renegotiated LNG deals. ” Flexible and wide ranging contracts are a primary area where the U.S. LNG industry seeks to stand out among a growing list of competitors, all primed to meet the world’s “dash to gas.” Importantly, this competition will include heavily equipped Russia, already accounting for nearly a quarter of the world’s traded gas.
