NASHVILLE, Tenn., July 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Following significant investments to support population growth and the reliability of its system, Piedmont Natural Gas today filed a request with the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (TPUC) to raise its base rates by 15%.
Piedmont's last base rate adjustment was nearly nine years ago. Since 2012, Piedmont has invested approximately $600 million in the Nashville metropolitan area to build the infrastructure needed to support the community's substantial growth, which includes an increase in population of 11.2% since 2010, and comply with federal safety regulations.
"Piedmont has made vital upgrades to our natural gas system in this growing community without a rate increase for nearly a decade â€“ a result of our strong effort to control costs and minimize impacts to customers," said Sasha Weintraub, Piedmont Natural Gas senior vice president.
If approved, the new rates could go into effect Jan. 1, 2021, with the utility's average residential customer experiencing a bill increase of about $11 each month, or $132 annually.
"With the cost of natural gas continuing to decrease, customer bills after the proposed rate adjustment would still be lower than they were in July 2018, and Piedmont will be able to continue supporting growth and prosperity in our Tennessee communities," said Weintraub.
The new proposed residential rate will be 10% less than the rate was in July 2018, as Piedmont made a series of rate adjustments that resulted in a net bill decrease of $14 per month for the average residential customer between March 2019 and March 2020.
