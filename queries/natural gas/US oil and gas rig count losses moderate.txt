The number of operating oil and gas rigs fell slightly in the 17th straight week of losses.
The U.S. rig count fell slightly in the 17th straight week of losses as energy companies shut down oil production amid low crude oil prices.
Energy companies are operating 263 oil and gas rigs nationally, two fewer than a week ago, according to Baker Hughes, a Houston oil-field services company that has tracked the rig count since the 1940s. There are 185 active oil rigs and 76 active natural gas rigs in the U.S.
The rig count, a leading indicator of U.S. oil and gas production, has plunged more than 60 percent since mid-March. The count is well below the bottom of the last oil bust in May 2016, when there were 404 operating rigs nationally.
The Permian Basin, which hosts about half of the nation’s oil and gas rigs, lost five oil and gas rigs last week.
Oil futures in the U.S. were trading at $40.43 a barrel at 1 p.m. central on Wednesday.
