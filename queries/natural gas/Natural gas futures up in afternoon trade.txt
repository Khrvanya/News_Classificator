Natural gas futures rose to Rs 138.10 per mmBtu on June 5 as participants increased their long positions.
Natural gas is supported by lower US gas production and increased in storm activity in Atlantic but weaker export demand capped the upside.
The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that US natural gas inventories increased by 102 billion cubic feet (bcf) for the week-ended May 29.
In the futures market, natural gas for June delivery touched an intraday high of Rs 138.90 and an intraday low of Rs 137.70 per mmBtu on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX). So far in the current series, natural gas has touched a low of Rs 132.50 and a high of Rs 179.10.
