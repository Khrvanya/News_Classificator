Total revenues were $8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $16.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. The Company had a net loss of $24.0 million, or $0.38 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to a net loss of $.5 million, or $0.04 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended December 31, 2019, and a net loss of $3.9 million, or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Capital expenditures and seismic and corporate expenditures totaled $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, as compared to $4.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $9.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019.

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity for the first quarter of 2020 were its cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and the sale of assets. At March 31, 2020, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million, $10.6 million in short-term debt, and a working capital surplus of $5.9 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $9.7 million, $2.9 million in long-term debt, $17.1 million in short-term debt, and a working capital surplus of $2.0 million at December 31, 2019.
In March 2020, crude oil prices declined to approximately $25 per barrel for Brent crude as a result of market concerns about the economic impact from the coronavirus as well as the ability of OPEC and Russia to agree on a perceived need to implement further production cuts in response to weaker worldwide demand.  Since then, Brent crude prices have rebounded to approximately $39.00 per barrel as of June 12, 2020 and remain volatile and unpredictable. The current futures forward curve for Brent crude indicates that prices may continue at or near current prices for an extended time.
As a result of the decline in Brent crude prices, the current near term price outlook and resulting lower current and projected cash flows from operations, the Company has reduced its planned capital expenditures to those necessary for production lease maintenance and those projecting a return on invested capital at current prices. In order to mitigate the impact of reduced prices on the Company’s 2020 cash flows and liquidity, the Company implemented cost reduction measures to reduce its operating costs and general and administrative expenses. In connection therewith, the Company intends to prioritize funding operating expenditures over general and administrative expenditures, whenever possible.
On March 9, 2020, the Company unwound its commodity derivative contracts with respect to its future crude oil production. In connection with these transactions, the Company received $6.5 million. In order to reduce future interest expense, the Company used these proceeds to pay down the Company’s $20.0 million term loan (the “2019 Term Loan”) with DenizBank, A.S. (“DenizBank”). On April 3, 2020, the Company entered into a new swap contract with DenizBank, which hedged approximately 2,000 barrels of oil per day. The swap contract is in place from May 2020 through February 2021, has an ICE Brent Index strike price of $36.00 per barrel, and is settled monthly. Therefore, DenizBank is required to make a payment to the Company if the average monthly ICE Brent Index price is less than $36.00 per barrel, and the Company is required to make a payment to DenizBank if the average monthly ICE Brent Index price is greater than $36.00 per barrel.
Türkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.Ş. (“TUPRAS”), a privately-owned oil refinery in Turkey, purchases substantially all of the Company’s crude oil production. The price of substantially all of the oil delivered pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement with TUPRAS is tied to Arab Medium oil prices adjusted upward based on an API adjustment, Suez Canal tariff costs, and freight charges. Recently, there has been a significant widening of the differential between the ICE Brent Index price and the Company’s realized oil prices. In 2018 and 2019, the average monthly differential between the ICE Brent Index Price and the Company’s realized oil prices was $2.44 and $0.17 per barrel, respectively. In April and May 2020, the average monthly differential between the ICE Brent Index Price and the Company’s realized oil prices was $6.90 and $8.34 per barrel, respectively. The widening of the differential between ICE Brent Index Price and the Company’s realized oil prices has rendered the Company’s hedges less effective, resulting in significantly lowered revenues. This differential may expand or contract in the future.
The price of the oil delivered pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement with TUPRAS is determined under the Petroleum Market Law No. 5015 under the laws of the Republic of Turkey. In November 2019, TUPRAS filed a lawsuit seeking restitution from us for alleged overpayments resulting from a February 2019 amendment to the Turkish domestic crude oil pricing formula under Petroleum Market Law No. 5015 (the “Pricing Amendment”). TUPRAS also claimed that the Pricing Amendment violates the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey and seeks to have the Pricing Amendment cancelled. Additionally, in April 2020, TUPRAS notified us that it intends to extend payment terms for oil purchases by 60 days. The outcome of the TUPRAS lawsuit and negotiations regarding the extension of payment terms is uncertain; however, a conclusion of the lawsuit in TUPRAS’s favor or an extension of payment terms would reduce or delay the Company’s cash flow and decrease the Company’s cash balances.
In the second quarter of 2020, the Company borrowed approximately $626,000 pursuant to the U.S. Payment Protection Program (the “PPP”) to cover certain payroll, benefit, and rent expenses. The Company has forecast that amounts borrowed or received pursuant to the PPP will be forgiven for cash flow purposes. New guidance on the criteria for forgiveness continues to be released. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2020, the Turkish government passed legislation permitting employers to reduce the working hours of employees, reducing payroll and benefit expenses, through the end of June 2020. The projected reduction in payroll and benefit expenses due to this legislation is approximately $360,000.
As of March 31, 2020, the Company has $10.6 million of outstanding principal under the 2019 Term Loan. The 2019 Term Loan is payable in one monthly installment of $0.6 million in June 2020 and seven monthly installments of $1.4 million plus accrued interest from July 2020 through the maturity date in February 2021. In addition, dividends on the Company’s 12.0% Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Shares (“Series A Preferred Shares”) are payable quarterly at the Company’s election in cash, common shares, or a combination of cash and common shares at an annual dividend rate of 12.0% of the liquidation preference if paid in cash or 16.0% of the liquidation preference if paid in common shares. If paid partially in cash and partially in common shares, the dividend rate on the cash portion is 12.0%, and the dividend rate on the common share portion is 16.0%. In order to conserve cash, the Company elected to pay the second dividend in 2020 in common shares.
As of the date hereof, based on cash on hand and projected future cash flow from operations, the Company’s current liquidity position is severely constrained and is forecast to worsen during 2020 as revenues are insufficient to meet the Company’s ordinary course expenditures and debt obligations. Based on current cash flow forecasts, the Company may be unable to pay the scheduled monthly installments on the 2019 Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2020 unless it can increase revenues, obtain additional financing, or restructure its current obligations. To date, the Company has been unable to restructure its current obligations or obtain additional financing to alleviate these liquidity issues. As a result, substantial doubt exists regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s management is actively pursuing improving its working capital position in order to remain a going concern for the foreseeable future.
During 2020, the Company plans to continue its recompletion, workover, and production optimization plans in its producing fields including Bahar, Yeniev, Goksu, Pinar, Southeast Bahar, Catak, and Karagoz. Drilling additional wells will be dependent on oil prices.
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company started construction of phase II electrification of the Bahar field to replace diesel generated power with gas generated power, which will be distributed to each well in the field. The phase II electrification was completed and operational in the second quarter of 2020.
The Company whipstocked the Goksu-4H well in January 2020. The well was re-drilled to a total depth of 5,720 feet. Although the Company encountered high permeability in the Mardin formation, tests did not indicate commercial quantities of oil.
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company started implementation of a full field waterflood of the Arpatepe field. The Company plans to recomplete four well in the field as water injection wells and one well as a water source well. Additionally, the Company plans to build a central facility and gathering system to handle increased volumes, however this is subject to change due to budget constraints and partner requests.
During 2020, the Company plans to continue its recompletion, workover, and production optimization operations in the Selmo field.
The Company is currently evaluating future activity in Bulgaria.
