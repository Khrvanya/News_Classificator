Italian energy major Eni announced on Wednesday a new “significant” natural gas and condensate discovery offshore Egypt, Kallanish Energy reports.
The Bashrush discovery is located at 22 meters of water depth, in the conventional shallow waters of the Nile Delta, in the Mediterranean Sea. It’s the first exploration well Eni and partners drilled in the North El Hammad license.
The well hit a single 152 meters thick gas column with “excellent petrophysical properties,” Eni said in a statement. It will now be tested and the partners, which include BP and Total, will begin screening the development options.
The aim is to “fast track” production through synergies with the area’s existing infrastructure, Eni added. In parallel with the development activities for the discovery, Eni will continue to explore the Great Nooros Area with the drilling of another exploration well this year.
The concession hosting the Bashrush discovery is operated by Eni via its affiliate IEOC (37.5%), in partnership with BP (37.5%) and Total (25%). The Egyptian state-owned gas company EGAS is also involved in the license.
