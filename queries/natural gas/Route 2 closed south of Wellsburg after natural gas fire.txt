BEECH BOTTOM â€” State Route 2 between Wellsburg and Beech Bottom was closed Monday evening following a natural gas fire that occurred while crews were working on the retaining wall for the Wellsburg-Brilliant bridge.
Mike Witherow, district construction engineer for the West Virginia Division of Highways, said crews were drilling along the hillside when they released a pocket of natural gas.
He said no one was harmed and the fire eventually subsided.
Witherow said crews called for help as a precaution, and several local fire departments responded.
He said late Monday the section of highway was expected to remain closed at least the night while the situation was monitored.
