British wholesale gas prices rose on Tuesday morning amid an undersupplied gas system and a strong rise in U.S. gas and carbon emissions prices in the previous day.
* The day-ahead contract was 1.00 pence up at 16.00 pence per therm by 0847 GMT.
* The within-day contract rose by 0.85 p to 16.00 p/therm.
* The UK gas system was 7.6 million cubic metres (mcm) undersupplied, with demand at 192.3 mcm and supply at 184.7 mcm, National Grid data showed.
* Gas demand is expected to be supported by a drop in wind generation after strong wind power production on Monday, Refinitiv analysts said in a morning note.
* Peak wind generation is forecast at 11.2 gigawatts (GW) on Tuesday, plunging to 3.5 GW on Wednesday out of 18 GW capacity, Elexon data showed.
* British and Dutch gas prices are also impacted by a strong rise in U.S. Henry Hub and carbon emission prices in the previous day, a gas trader said.
* U.S. natural gas futures rose over 10% on Monday due to expectations of higher cooling demand.
* The benchmark Dec-20 EU carbon contract rose over 5% a tonne on Monday afternoon, but was 0.42 euro lower at 26.21 euros a tonne on Tuesday morning.
* Liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply could be lower in July due to a tighter LNG market and a large number of U.S. cargo cancellations, which could support UK gas prices, Refinitiv analysts said.
* On Tuesday, LNG sendout was slightly up.
* Flows from Norway increased by 10 mcm due to higher flows via the Langeled pipeline, Gassco data showed. But this was not enough to eliminate undersupply.
* UK July contract rose by 0.25 p to 16.00 p/therm.
* The July gas price at the Dutch TTF hub was up 0.07 euro at 5.87 euros per megawatt hour.
