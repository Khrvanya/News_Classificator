Richard Bove, a sell-side bank analyst with several decades of experience who works for Odeon Capital Group, says investors should avoid bank stocks as a group because of the disruption to their business models from low interest rates and evolving technology for products and services that have become commodities.
He detailed all those concerns in a report Feb. 3, well before the S&P 500 Index SPX,
hit its last record high Feb. 19.
On March 8, after Saudi Arabia announced its oil price cuts and plans to increase production, Bove sent a note to clients expressing particular concern for the big four.
“One might argue that both J.P. Morgan and Citigroup were built on oil,” he wrote.
