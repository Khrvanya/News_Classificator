San Francisco has introduced legislation that would bar natural gas use in new buildings, Kallanish Energy reports.
The proposed city-wide building code would require that all newly constructed buildings in the city be gas-free, as the natural gas battle grows in California.
To date, about 30 cities in California and a few other states have taken action to phase out natural gas because of its climate-warming impacts. That has led a handful of states to pass legislation barring such natural gas bans.
Cities like San Francisco have concluded that going all-electric is the best way to proceed. San Francisco with 880,000 residents is the second largest California city behind San Jose to take such action.
Berkeley, California, was the first U.S. city to ban natural gas in new buildings. San Francisco already bans natural gas in any new city buildings.
The proposed legislation was introduced by Supervisor Rafael Mandelman. The ordinance would limit permits for newly constructed houses and businesses that use gas after Jan. 1, 2021.
The natural gas ban would also affect major building renovations, but does not impact existing buildings.
The new plan could impact 53,000 planned housing units plus commercial spaces that are in development in the city, officials said.
If a gas-free project is structurally not feasible, exemptions can be granted to the city’s Department of Building Inspection.
The legislation would also extend the permit deadline for new restaurants to use natural gas by one year to January 2022.
Buildings account for about 43% of San Francisco’s greenhouse gas emissions and 80% of those emissions came from natural gas , officials said.
