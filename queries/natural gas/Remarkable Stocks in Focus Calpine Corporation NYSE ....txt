On Monday, Shares of Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN), lost -0.64% to $15.41.
Calpine Corporation, stated third quarter 2015 Adjusted EBITDA of $791 million, contrast to $745 million in the preceding year period, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $576 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, contrast to $506 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income1 for the third quarter of 2015 was $273 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, contrast to $614 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income, As Adjusted2, for the third quarter of 2015 was $347 million contrast to $306 million in the preceding year period. The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Income, As Adjusted,were primarily due to higher Commodity Margin driven by the acquisition of our Fore River Energy Center in November 2014 and the commencement of operations at our Garrison Energy Center in June 2015, in addition to higher regulatory capacity revenue in PJM.
Year-to-date 2015 Adjusted EBITDA was $1,586 million, contrast to $1,604 million in the preceding year period, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $745 million, or $2.02 per diluted share, contrast to $735 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income1 for the first nine months of 2015 was $282 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, contrast to $736 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the preceding year period. Net Income, As Adjusted2, for the first nine months of 2015 was $318 million contrast to $359 million in the preceding year period. The decreases in Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income, As Adjusted, were primarily due to lower Commodity Margin driven largely by a noteworthy decrease in power and natural gas prices in our East region in the first quarter of 2015, given the unusually high price levels practiced during the polar vortex events in the preceding year period, in addition to net portfolio changes and lower regulatory capacity revenue in PJM. The improvement in Adjusted Free Cash Flow was due to lower interest expense contrast to the preceding year period, which more than offset the decline in Adjusted EBITDA.
“I am happy to report another solid quarter, with record generation volume of 33 million MWh, top quartile safety performance and continued commercial success,” said Thad Hill, Calpine’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “As a result, we are narrowing our 2015 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.965 billion to $2.0 billion. This is within our preceding guidance range and reflects an adjustment for the projected impact of the Valley wildfire in Northern California on The Geysers geothermal facilities, which we formerly declared. I would like to recognize our team at The Geysers whose extraordinary efforts have resulted in production already reaching about 575 net MW, or nearly 80% of full capacity.
