(WKOW) -- Dane County's renewable natural gas station received a special delivery on Thursday.
It accepted its first load of natural gas that was generated from a manure digester.
This is part of an effort to clean up local lakes and address greenhouse gases.
"This one load here. For every load because that will be burned as vehicle fuel it will reduce the amount of CO2 into the air by the equivalent of what would be 24,000 pounds of coal," said Dane County Executive Joe Parisi.
The county is working with Brightmark Energy which has a digester northwest of Waunakee in the Town of Vienna.
The biogas that's converted from 90,000 gallons of manure per day will be trucked to the county offload station.
