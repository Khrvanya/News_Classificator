Iraq is mulling to invest in gas fields in Kurdistan, as well as use natural gas production for the semi-autonomous region to run Iraqi power plants, Kallanish Energy reports.
According to Iraq’s oil minister Thamer Al-Ghadhban, there are “large and promising” gas reserves in a number of discovered fields, which lack investment. He said Bagdad was also studying a proposal to invest in gas to generate electricity throughout Iraq.
A technical team with members from both sides is in charge of planning and studying the feasibility of such project. The ministry didn’t provide further details.
Iraq currently relies on Iranian gas and electricity supply to manage its domestic power shortage. It has to obtain a special waiver from the U.S. to continue imports from Tehran, given Washington has sanctioned Iran’s energy industry and all parties involved with it.
Bagdad received in March a 30-day waiver extension from the U.S. – the shortest exemption period granted since November 2018. It’s unclear whether a new extension will be issued.
During the meeting with the Kurdish delegation last Sunday, Al-Ghadhban said crude oil production in the region would have to be cut due to the Opec+ agreement that Iraq is part of.
The country agreed to a 23% production reduction in May and June, the minister said, adding oilfields in Kurdistan are also included in the cuts.
