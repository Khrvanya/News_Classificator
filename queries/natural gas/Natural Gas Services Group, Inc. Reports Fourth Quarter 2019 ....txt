Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NYSE: NGS ), a leading provider of gas compression equipment and services to the natural gas and oil industry, announces its financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2019. Financial results contained herein reflect the audited consolidated financial statements included in NGS's Form 10-K that was filed on March 31, 2020.
Revenue: Total revenue increased by 22% to $19.7 million for the three months ended in December 31, 2019 compared $16.2 million for the three months ended in December 31, 2018.  This increase was primarily due to 19% growth in rental revenue to $15.3 million from $12.8 million during the same periods.  Total revenue decreased slightly between consecutive quarters to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $20.9 million in the third quarter of 2019 primarily due to a decrease in compressor sales, slightly offset by an increase in rental revenue. Total revenue increased to $78.4 million from $65.5 million, or approximately 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase in revenue was primarily the result of 19% growth in rental revenue driven by an increase in the rentals of large horsepower units as well as a 21% increase in sales revenue.
Operating (Loss) Income: Operating loss for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was $1.3 million, compared to operating loss of $491,000 for the comparative period in 2018. This increase in operating loss is due to a lower sales margin and was impacted by several additional expenses, including an increase in our bad debt allowance of $0.6 million; an increase in our inventory allowance of $0.4 million; higher depreciation expense attributable to our new larger horsepower compressors; and higher selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses associated with professional fees and our former Chief Financial Officer’s retirement.  Sequentially, reported operating loss decreased to a loss of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 from a reported operating loss of $14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, operating income was impacted by an inventory allowance, retirement of rental assets and an impairment of goodwill (“impairment and other non-cash charges”) that totaled $14.9 million.  In the fourth quarter of 2019, NGS took an additional inventory allowance of $408,000, resulting in impairment and non-cash charges that totaled $15.3 million in 2019. Excluding impairment and other non-cash charges, adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2019 was $880,000 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $881,000 during the fourth quarter of 2019. This decrease is primarily due to the higher bad debt allowance, lower compressor sales and lower sales margins during the fourth quarter. Reported operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a loss of $15.2 million compared to a $0.5 million operating loss in 2018. Excluding impairment and other non-cash charges, adjusted operating income was $156,000 during 2019, an increase from a loss of $507,000 during 2018 due to our 20% growth in revenue partially offset by lower margins as well as increased SG&A and depreciation expenses.
Gross Margins: Total gross margins remained flat at $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Total adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation, for the three months ended December 31, 2019, increased $301,000 to $7.9 million from $7.6 million for the same period ended December 31, 2018. This improvement is attributable to increased rental revenue partially offset by higher bad debt allowance and lower sales margins. Sequentially, total gross margin decreased to $2.0 million from $3.8 million.  Excluding depreciation, total adjusted gross margin decreased to $7.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $9.6 million during the third quarter of 2019. The sequential decrease was due to a decrease in compressor sales, sales margins and increased bad debt allowance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019. For the comparative year end periods, total gross margins increased to $11.2 million in 2019 from $8.8 million in 2018. Total adjusted gross margins increased by 11% to $34.1 million in 2019 from $30.7 million in 2018.  This increase was due to our 20% growth in revenue in 2019 that was partially offset by lower margins, as our total adjusted gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 44% in 2019 from 47% in 2018. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin, below.
Net (Loss) Income: The Company reported a net loss of $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $749,000 for the same period in 2018. Excluding an inventory allowance of $0.4 million, adjusted net loss for fourth quarter 2019 was $1.4 million. The fourth quarter 2018 net loss included an adjustment for income tax expense and interest (“tax adjustment”) related to executive compensation of $603,000. Excluding the tax adjustment, the adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter 2018 was $146,000. The increase in net loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is due to lower sales margins, higher bad debt allowance, higher depreciation expense attributable to our new larger horsepower compressors, and higher SG&A expenses associated with professional fees and our former Chief Financial Officer’s retirement.  Sequentially, NGS reported a net loss of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a reported net loss of $12.6 million in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding impairment and other non-cash charges, adjusted net loss was $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $967,000 in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease between sequential quarters is due to a decrease in compressor sales, lower sales margins and increased bad debt allowance in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2019.  Finally, we recorded adjusted net loss of $7,000 in 2019 compared to adjusted net income of $137,000 in 2018.

Adjusted loss per diluted share was 11 cents in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted loss per diluted share of 1 cent in same period in 2018.  Sequentially, diluted earnings per share increased from a loss per share of 96 cents in the third quarter of 2019 to a loss per diluted share of 13 cents in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding any impairment and other non-cash charges, adjusted loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 11 cents compared to earnings per diluted share of 7 cents in third quarter of 2019.  Excluding impairment and other non-cash adjustments in 2019 and tax adjustments in 2018, adjusted net loss per diluted share was zero in 2019 compared to earnings per diluted share of 1 cent in 2018.

Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA remained flat at $5.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.  Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $5.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $6.9 million in the previous quarter due to a decrease in compressor sales, lower sales margins and increased bad debt allowance in the fourth quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $24.0 million in 2019 compared to $21.8 million due to our 20% growth in revenue partially offset by lower margins and increased SG&A expenses.

Commenting on fourth quarter and year-end 2019 results, Stephen C. Taylor, President and CEO, said:
“Despite continued volatility in the energy markets and pressures on commodity prices, NGS continued to make progress in our core business during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Rental revenue increased 6% sequentially and 19% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  We are pleased with our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $24.0 million, which increased 10% when compared to 2018.  Additionally, our operating cash flow increased to $29.4 million, an increase of 24% over 2018.  We continue to have one of the strongest financial positions in the industry with over $ 11 million in net cash on the balance sheet.
There is little doubt that we are operating in an environment with significant headwinds and an unprecedented level of uncertainty. The NGS team will continue to deliver best-in-class service to our long-term customers who continue to need quality and reliable compression services. We will continue to focus on operating efficiently, use our existing contracts to generate cash and look for opportunities to allocate cash that provide returns to our stakeholders. With little short-term visibility for new projects, we expect capital expenditures to decline at least 75% in 2020, from approximately $65 million in 2019.”
