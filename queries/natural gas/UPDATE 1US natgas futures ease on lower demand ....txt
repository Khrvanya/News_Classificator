governments loosen travel and work restrictions.
    U.S. crude, meanwhile, remained on track to drop for a fourth week in a row, falling about 55%
in 2019 as drillers shut wells and cut spending on new drilling. That would be the first annual
production decline since 2016 and the first time output fell for two consecutive years since 2005.
    Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states averaged just 92.7 bcfd so far in
April, down from an all-time monthly high of 95.3 bcfd in November.
    EIA projected coronavirus lockdowns will cut U.S. gas use - not including exports - to an average of
83.8 bcfd in 2020 and 81.2 bcfd in 2021 from a record 85.0 bcfd in 2019. That would be the first annual
decline in consumption since 2017 and the first time demand falls for two consecutive years since 2006.
    With milder, spring-like weather coming, Refinitiv projected demand in the Lower 48 states, including
exports, would slide from an average of 86.7 bcfd this week to 85.1 bcfd next week.
    Even though the coronavirus is cutting gas use around the world, EIA still expects U.S. exports to
hit fresh record highs in coming years as more LNG export plants and pipelines enter service. The agency,
however, has said the pace of that growth will slow from what it had projected before the pandemic.
    U.S. LNG exports averaged only 8.3 bcfd so far in April, according to Refinitiv, down from an
all-time monthly high of 8.8 bcfd in February.
