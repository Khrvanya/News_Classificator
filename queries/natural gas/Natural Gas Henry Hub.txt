Natural gas is a fossil fuel that is both odorless and colorless in its purest form. The main component is methane, also known as CH4. The price of natural gas is often affected by adverse weather conditions, production increases, increased economic activity, and the availability of substitutes. Natural gas is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the worldâ€™s largest commodity futures exchange.
Composed of hydrogen and carbon atoms, natural gas is considered by some to be the cleanest burning fossil fuel. It produces carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen oxide as a byproduct. Although it was formed millions of years ago, natural gas persists as a widely used source of electricity and fuel today. Henry Hub is the name of a famous natural gas pipeline that runs through Erath, Louisiana. The Henry Hub Pipeline is connected to four domestic pipelines and nine international ones. The pipeline has great influence on the price of natural gas futures.
