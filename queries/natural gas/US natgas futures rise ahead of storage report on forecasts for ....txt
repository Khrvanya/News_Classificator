May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures rose almost 2% on Thursday on forecasts for more demand
over the next two weeks than previously expected.
five-year (2015-19) average build of 74 bcf for the period.
five-year average of 1.924 tcf for this time of year.
a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Thursday.
    Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 3.4 cents,
or 1.8%, to $1.978 per million British thermal units at 8:46 a.m. EDT.
    This has been a volatile week for U.S. gas. Prices jumped to a 16-week high on Tuesday after a big
pipe shut and slowing output, but fell almost 9% on Wednesday, the biggest percentage
decline in over a year, as government lockdowns to stop the coronavirus spread cause businesses to use
less gas and exports to drop.
    That price increase on Tuesday briefly made the U.S. front-month the most expensive of the world's
Netherlands and the Japan/Korea Marker (JKM), both of which are trading near record lows. The
decline on Wednesday, however, allowed JKM to return to its premium over Henry Hub. The U.S. contract
continues to trade over TTF for June and all of the summer forwards.
    Analysts said high U.S. gas prices and low prices elsewhere in the world could prompt buyers of U.S.
liquefied natural gas (LNG) to cancel more cargoes in coming months.
    Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states has fallen to 90.0 bcfd
    With even cooler weather coming, Refinitiv projected demand in the Lower 48 states, including
exports, would rise from an average of 83.7 bcfd this week to 87.6 bcfd next week. That is higher than
Refinitiv's forecasts on Wednesday of 82.9 bcfd this week and 85.4 bcfd next week.
    Refinitiv said U.S. LNG exports have averaged 7.0 bcfd so far in May, down from a four-month low of
8.1 bcfd in April and an all-time high of 8.7 bcfd in February.
