Align Midstream Partners II has announced completion of the TOPS natural gas gathering pipeline in East Texas and the creation of a new pipeline joint venture with Sabine Oil & Gas, Kallanish Energy reports.
The pipeline is a 30-mile, 16-inch-in-diameter pipeline in the area around Carthage, Texas, near the Texas-Louisiana border in the Haynesville Shale. There are interconnects to several downstream markets.
“The TOPS Pipeline will bolster our existing East Texas footprint and enhance our ability to serve the growing Haynesville production, providing our customers with greater access to a number of attractive markets across the Carthage hub,” said Align CEO Fritz Brinkman in a statement.
His midstream company, with headquarters in Dallas, Texas, is backed by Tailwater Capital.
Sabine is a subsidiary of Osaka Gas USA.
The joint venture marks Osaka Gas USA’s first acquisition in the United States midstream business.
