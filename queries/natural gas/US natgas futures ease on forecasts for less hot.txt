June 23 – U.S. natural gas futures eased on Tuesday as the market focuses more on forecasts for less hot weather and lower air conditioning demand than a slow increase in exports. Front-month gas futures fell 1.1 cents, or 0.7%, to $1.653 per million British thermal units at 7:50 a.m. EDT (1150 GMT). Refinitiv said production in the Lower 48 U.S. states averaged 87.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in June, down from a 16-month low of 88.2 bcfd in May and an all-time monthly high of 95.4 bcfd in November. On a daily basis, however, output rose to a five-week high of 88.4 bcfd over the weekend from a 19-month low of 85.7 bcfd in late May. Refinitiv forecast U.S. demand, including exports, would rise from 84.3 bcfd this week to 85.4 bcfd next week. That confirms Refinitiv’s warmer-than-usual projection but was slightly lower than its outlook on Monday. The amount of pipeline gas flowing to U.S. liquefied natural gas export plants averaged 4.0 bcfd (41% utilization) in June, down from an eight-month low of 6.4 bcfd in May and a record high of 8.7 bcfd in February. Utilization was about 90% in calendar 2019. On a daily basis, however, LNG exports were on track to rise to a two-week high of 4.3 bcfd on Tuesday from a 14-month low of 3.6 bcfd last week. U.S. pipeline exports were also rising as North American consumers crank up their air conditioners. Refinitiv said pipeline exports to Canada averaged 2.3 bcfd in June, up from a seven-month low of 2.2 bcfd in May but still well below the all-time monthly high of 3.5 bcfd in December. Pipeline exports to Mexico averaged 5.3 bcfd this month, up from 4.8 bcfd in May but shy of the record 5.6 bcfd in March.
