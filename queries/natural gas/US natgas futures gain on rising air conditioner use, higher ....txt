U.S. natgas futures gain on rising air conditioner use, higher LNG exports
June 3 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures climbed on Wednesday on forecasts for demand to rise as
April and May canceled cargoes due to record low prices in Europe. Buyers nominate cargoes a month or
two in advance of delivery.
    Over the past three days, however, major European benchmarks soared over
trading at a premium over the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana for the first time since late
    Front-month gas futures rose 3.4 cents, or 1.9%, to $1.811 per million British thermal units

    Data provider Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell to 88.3 billion
cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in June, down from a one-year low of 89.3 bcfd in May and an all-time
monthly high of 95.4 bcfd in November.
    With the coming of warmer summer weather, Refinitiv projected U.S. demand, including exports, would
rise from 81.0 bcfd this week to 82.0 bcfd next week.
    The amount of pipeline gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants was on track to reach 4.5 bcfd on
Wednesday up from a 13-month low of 3.8 bcfd earlier in the week. That compares with an eight-month low
of 6.4 bcfd in May and a monthly record high of 8.7 bcfd in February.
