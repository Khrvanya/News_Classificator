UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures fall on mild forecasts, lower demand and exports
    April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell on Wednesday on forecasts for milder weather and
lower demand - especially export demand - over the next two weeks than previously expected.
crude prices prompted drillers to  shut oil wells in shale basins that also produce a lot of gas. Still,
outbreaks could bring renewed demand pullbacks," Daniel Myers, market analyst at Gelber & Associates in
of up to 25 U.S. LNG cargoes for June."
    On its first day as the front-month, gas futures for June delivery fell 7.9 cents, or 4.1%, to
settle at $1.869 per million British thermal units. That, however, is still about 7% over where the May
in 2019 as drillers shut wells and cut spending.
    Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states averaged 92.7 bcfd so far in
April, down from 93.2 bcfd in March and an all-time monthly high of 95.3 bcfd in November.
    EIA projected coronavirus lockdowns will cut U.S. gas use - not including exports - to an average of
83.8 bcfd in 2020 and 81.2 bcfd in 2021 from a record 85.0 bcfd in 2019.
    With milder spring weather coming, Refinitiv projected demand in the Lower 48 states, including
exports, would slide from an average of 86.3 bcfd this week to 84.6 bcfd next week. That compares with
Refinitiv's forecasts on Tuesday of 86.7 bcfd this week and 85.1 bcfd next week.
    Even though the coronavirus is cutting gas use worldwide, EIA still expects U.S. exports to hit
record highs in coming years as more LNG export plants and pipelines enter service. Still, the agency has
reduced its projections on the pace of that growth due to the pandemic.
    U.S. LNG exports averaged 8.1 bcfd so far in April, according to Refinitiv, down from 8.3 bcfd in
March and an all-time monthly high of 8.8 bcfd in February.
