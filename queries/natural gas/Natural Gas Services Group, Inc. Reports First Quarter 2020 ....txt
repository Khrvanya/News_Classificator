Cash of $13.1 million and minimal debt ($0.4 million) at the end of the first quarter.

Revenue: Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2020 remained relatively flat at $17.9 million compared $18.0 million for the three months ended in March 31, 2019.  This outcome was due to higher rental revenue (20% increase) during the first quarter of 2020 due to a greater number of large horsepower units being rented offset by lower sales revenue (65% decrease) primarily due to reduced compressor sales. Total revenue decreased 9% to $17.9 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily due to a 63% decrease in sales revenue that was partially offset by a 5% increase in rental revenue.
Gross Margins: Total gross margins decreased 14% to $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $2.4 million for the same period in 2019.  Total adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation, for the three months ended March 31, 2020, increased $0.2 million to $8.1 million from $7.9 million for the same period ended March 31, 2019. This improvement was attributable to increased rental revenue, which has higher margins than sales revenue, partially offset by lower sales revenue and lower sales margins. Sequentially, total gross margin remained flat at $2.0 million. Excluding depreciation, total adjusted gross margin increased to $8.1 million during the first quarter of 2020 compared to $7.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2019. The sequential increase was due to an increase in rental revenue and lower bad debt allowance offset by lower sales revenue and lower sales margins during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin, below.
Operating (Loss) Income: Operating loss increased to $273,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to an operating loss of $145,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019. This increased operating loss was mainly due to lower sales revenue and higher depreciation expense attributable to our new larger horsepower compressors. These factors were mostly offset by higher rental revenues, slightly higher adjusted gross margins, and lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses due mostly to a net unrealized gain on deferred compensation. Sequentially, operating loss decreased to a loss of $273,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from an operating loss of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, NGS recorded an inventory write-off of $408,000. Excluding the inventory write-off, adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $881,000. This $0.6 million decrease in sequential adjusted operating loss is primarily due to higher rental revenue, lower bad debt allowance, and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by lower sales revenue and lower sales margins during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Operating Loss and Adjusted Net Loss, below.
Net (Loss) Income: The Company generated net income of $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to net income of $98,000 for the same period in 2019.  Excluding a $4.9 million income tax benefit related to a recent tax law change, adjusted net loss for first quarter of 2020 was $0.8 million.  This $0.9 million decrease to an adjusted net loss is due to lower sales revenue, lower sales margins, higher depreciation expense, an unrealized loss on company-owned life insurance, and deferred income tax expense related to vesting of restricted stock partially offset by higher rental revenues, lower cost of revenues, and lower SG&A expenses during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019.  Sequentially, NGS generated net income of $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a reported net loss of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding an inventory write-off of $408,000, adjusted net loss for fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.4 million. The $0.6 million decrease in adjusted net loss between sequential quarters is primarily due to higher rental revenue, lower bad debt allowance, and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by lower sales revenue, lower sales margins, an unrealized loss on company-owned life insurance and deferred income tax expense during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.   Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Operating Loss and Adjusted Net Loss, below.
Earnings per share: For the first quarter of 2020, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of 30 cents compared to earnings per diluted share of 1 cent in the first quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported a loss per diluted share of 6 cents for the first quarter of 2020.  Sequentially, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of 30 cents in the first quarter of 2020 compared by a loss per diluted share of 13 cents in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported a loss per diluted share of 6 cents for the first quarter of 2020 compared a loss per diluted share of 11 cents in the fourth quarter of 2019. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Operating Loss and Adjusted Net Loss, below.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased slightly to $5.8 million from $5.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to $5.2 million in the previous quarter due higher rental revenues, much lower bad debt allowance and a lower SG&A expenses partially offset by lower sales revenue and lower sales margins. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA, below.
Cash flow: At March 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $13.1 million, while working capital was $51.2 million and total debt was $417,000. Cash flow from operating activities was $8.3 million, while cash flow used in investing activities was $6.7 million through March 31, 2020. Our cash flow used in investing activities included $5.8 million in rental equipment capital expenditures.
Paycheck Protection Program loan and repayment: As previously announced, on April 10, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note (the “Loan”) in the amount of $4.6 million through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The Loan was made for the purpose of securing funding for salaries and wages of employees that may have otherwise been displaced by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting detrimental impact on the Company’s business.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”) processed and funded the Loan.
After the Loan was funded, the U.S. Treasury Department and other federal officials responsible for administering the PPP advised that public companies that applied for and received PPP loans may be subject to increased scrutiny and potential liability if it is determined that such companies had access to alternative sources of capital. While the Company believes it was justified in seeking the Loan and the funds received were earmarked for the purposes set forth in the PPP regulations, the Company voluntarily repaid the Loan, with accrued interest, to the Lender on May 4, 2020.
Commenting on First Quarter 2020 results, Stephen C. Taylor, President and CEO, said:
“Given the challenges in our industry and the overall economy, we are pleased with our operational performance in the first quarter of 2020.  Our rental revenue increased 5% sequentially and 20% when compared to the first quarter of 2019, which was driven by increased rentals of our large horsepower units.  Our unit and horsepower utilization remained solid, and we generated adjusted EBITDA of $5.8 million, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of 2019.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $8.3 million.
"The impact of COVID-19 and the resulting evisceration of oil demand continues to cloud our visibility for short-term business prospects.  In April, as expected, we experienced an increase in unit returns and shut-in notices from customers.  We anticipate and are prepared for additional volatility in our business over the course of the next several months.  Nevertheless, unlike many other oilfield service companies, NGS has the balance sheet to withstand this environment.  With $13.1 million in cash on hand, minimal debt and an expected $15 million in cash from tax refunds, we have adequate liquidity and are well positioned to thrive when a more normal industry and economic environment returns.”
