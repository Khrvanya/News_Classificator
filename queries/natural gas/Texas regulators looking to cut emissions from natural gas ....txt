State agencies are aiming to implement environmental safeguards on gas flaring.
The Railroad Commission of Texas could implement tighter restrictions on natural gas flaring by fall.
This comes amid flailing oil prices and greater sustainability initiatives.
By fall, Texas may institute more stringent rules surrounding the practice of natural gas flaring, Reuters reports .
Natural gas flaring is a way to get rid of natural gas produced with oil drilling that is considered unsellable for safety or economic reasons. As the gas openly burns, toxic chemicals and pollutants can sometimes emit into the atmosphere. This has made it a controversial environmental problem, as it adds carbon into the air, exacerbating already rising global temperatures.
A Tuesday meeting between industry leaders and state regulators yielded new recommendations to mitigate the environmental damage caused by gas flaring, such as limiting the time an administrative approval can be provided for flaring excess gas to 90 days from 180 days, the official report states.

Wayne Christian, the Texas Railroad Commission chairman, which regulates the industry, has ordered an investigation into which measures can be implemented in the fall of 2020.
“This is now the opportune time to implement meaningful reforms to reduce flaring before oil and gas production climbs back to previous highs,” Christian said, according to Reuters.
Part of the new regulations would include more accurate data on flaring practice and tracking how gas is disposed. Improving the data “will be a priority” according to fellow Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick.
