Ukraine ended the heating season 2019/2020 with the biggest stocks of natural gas in its underground gas storage (UGS) facilities in the past 30 years, and as of April 7, 2020 they stood at 15.8 billion cubic meters (bcm), the press service of NJSC Naftogaz Ukrainy has said.
Over the past three decades, Ukraine has also been closest to the said indicator after the 2008/2009 heating season. The state ended it with reserves being 15.4 bcm.
According to the results of the 2019/20 season, the gas volume in UGS facilities exceeded the indicator of the previous season by 45%, Naftogaz said, adding that this year, the weather allowed to stop gas pumping from the UGS facilities and start the season of gas injection back in March, whereas 2019, the gas began in April.
“We have created large stocks of natural gas in the case of transit termination in 2020. This has strengthened the position of Ukraine in the negotiations on a new transit contract and helped to achieve favorable conditions for Ukraine. Today, we are facing a new challenge for energy stability, but large stocks of gas in UGS facilities will help us overcome this crisis as well,” Naftogaz Ukrainy Executive Board Chairman Andriy Kobolev said.
