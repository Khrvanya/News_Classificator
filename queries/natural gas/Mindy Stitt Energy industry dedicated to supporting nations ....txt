Celebrating our nation’s independence reminds us to be thankful for the efforts of those that help ensure our continued freedom, especially the men and women in our military. The people of Oklahoma Oil & Natural Gas are also playing a role in supporting this mission by producing essential resources that have made our country energy-independent.
As the third-largest producer of natural gas and fourth-largest producer of oil, every Oklahoman can take pride in the role our state plays in U.S. energy independence. Innovative technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have led to producing more oil and natural gas more efficiently than ever before while protecting our local communities every step of the way.
Domestic production provides cheaper and cleaner energy here at home while also helping our nation become a net oil and natural gas exporter, something that was once thought impossible. Because of these advancements, our nation is no longer reliant on foreign, and often unfriendly, regimes to supply the energy that fuels our quality of life.
While there may not be any “Made in Oklahoma” stickers attached, the resources produced here are shipped to countless homes and businesses beyond our state lines, powering American progress. Byproducts are used to create 96% of manufactured goods. From cutting-edge technologies to uniform materials like Nomex to Kevlar, which help keep the brave men and women of our nation’s military safe.
Our industry is going through a challenging time right now but just like our nation’s forefathers, they won’t give up. The people of Oklahoma Oil & Natural Gas are hardworking, resilient and dedicated to this state and our country. They will continue to find a way to keep producing the resources that fuel our way of life and support our nation’s independence.
