    April 30 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures rose to a 10-week high on Thursday as output slows
because drillers are shutting oil wells in shale basins due to the recent collapse in crude prices. Those
oil wells also produce a lot of gas.
    That price increase came despite a report showing an expected storage build last week, and forecasts

above the five-year average of 1.850 tcf for this time of year.
    Front-month gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 8.0 cents,
or 4.3%, to settle at $1.949 per million British thermal units, their highest since Feb. 19.
    For the month, the contract gained about 18% after falling around 37% over the prior five months.
That is the biggest increase in a month since November 2018.
    Data provider Refinitiv said gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states averaged 92.7 bcfd so far in
April, down from 93.2 bcfd in March and an all-time monthly high of 95.4 bcfd in November.
    EIA projected coronavirus lockdowns will cut U.S. gas use - not including exports - to an average of
83.8 bcfd in 2020 and 81.2 bcfd in 2021 from a record 85.0 bcfd in 2019.
    With milder spring weather coming, Refinitiv projected demand in the Lower 48 states, including
exports, would slide from an average of 86.2 bcfd this week to 85.0 bcfd next week. That compares with
Refinitiv's forecasts on Wednesday of 86.3 bcfd this week and 84.6 bcfd next week.
