The price of natural gas fell Monday, weighed down by expectations for milder weather in parts of the U.S.
Natural-gas futures tumbled 4.5% to $2.566 per million British thermal units amid predictions of moderating temperatures next week, after a frigid start to November drove prices up earlier this month. Since demand for natural gas tends to climb when people use their heaters in the winter and air conditioners in the summer, changes in weather forecasts can precipitate price swings.
