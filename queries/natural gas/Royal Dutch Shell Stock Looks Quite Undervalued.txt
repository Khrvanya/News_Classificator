After slashing quarterly dividend by 66% and suspending share buyback program, investors fear that Royal Dutch Shell’s (NYSE: RDS.A) cash preservation initiatives will last for a while amidst the low production environment. While commodity prices remain weak from low transportation and industrial demand, Trefis takes a closer look at profitability and asset distribution across the three segments to analyze Royal Dutch Shell’s valuation. With OPEC+ cuts extended till July, upstream oil companies face regulatory pressure to curtail production further, and the company expects a 40-50% contraction (y-o-y) in oil product sales volume for Q2. Interestingly, the company has not significantly lowered integrated gas and LNG production volumes, which are expected to shrink by 15-20% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Shell is one of the largest integrated oil majors with $352 billion in annual revenues and 3,665 MBD of oil & gas production. It has three operating segments: Upstream, Downstream, and Integrated Gas.
In 2019, the integrated gas segment generated $45.6 billion in revenues (including inter-segment sales) with 922 MBD of natural gas and 35.5 million tonnes (nearly 816 MBD) of liquefaction volumes.
Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America account for 10%, 27%, 22%, and 20% of natural gas production, respectively.
Along with the expected contraction in the global economy, natural gas demand to likely shrink by 5% in 2020.
However, the expanding share of natural gas as an energy source for electricity generation is expected to support Shell’s integrated gas segment’s earnings in the long run.
In the past three years, Shell has increased the segment’s capital expenditure from $3.5 billion in 2017 to $3.8 billion in 2019, along with a 5% growth in total production.
On the contrary, the Upstream segment’s capital expenses declined by 10% while production volumes remained flat.
In 2019, Shell’s total production stood at 3,665 MBD, including 1,876 MBD of crude oil and 1,790 MBD of natural gas.
Considering intersegment sales, the $46 billion of Upstream revenues (majorly liquid fuels) are comparable to the $45 billion of Integrated Gas revenues, which includes LNG sales and the new energy portfolio.
More so, the integrated gas segment commands a 45% share of the total earnings with a 21% net margin.
Despite the near-term shock from the coronavirus crisis, the growing demand for natural gas is likely to support the company’s earnings and shareholder returns in the long-run.
Thus, we estimate Royal Dutch Shell’s stock valuation to be around $51 per share – which is 50% above the current market price.
