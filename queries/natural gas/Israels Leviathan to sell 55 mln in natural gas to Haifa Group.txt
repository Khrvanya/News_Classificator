The partners in Israel’s Leviathan natural gas field have agreed to supply $55 million in gas to the Haifa Group over five years, the companies said on Tuesday.
Haifa Group, which deals in specialty fertilizers, will buy 0.06 billion cubic meters of gas each year under the deal. The company is planning to invest 1.2 billion shekels ($347 million) to double its production capacity in southern Israel, including the construction of a new ammonia plant.
The Leviathan partners include Texas-based Noble Energy and Israel’s Delek Drilling and Ratio Oil . They have now signed 14 local supply deals along with export agreements to Egypt and Jordan.
