The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week the countryâ€™s natural gas stocks were 827 billion cubic feet (Bcf), or 63%, higher than the same period last year.
The latest data, which corresponds to the week ending on April 17, points to 2,140 Bcf of working natural gas in underground storage, Kallanish Energy reports.
The Lower 48 volumes represent a net weekly build of 43 Bcf and an increase of 364 Bcf compared to the five-year average of 1,776 Bcf. However, the EIA noted that current volumes of total working gas are within the five-year historical range.
Stocks were the highest in the South Central region of the U.S. at 941 Bcf, also the area reporting the biggest growth, 29 Bcf.
The next storage report will be published on April 23.
