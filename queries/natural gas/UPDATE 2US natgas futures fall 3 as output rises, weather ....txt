UPDATE 2-U.S. natgas futures fall 3% as output rises, weather turns milder
    March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell on Tuesday with an increase in output and on
forecasts for milder weather and lower heating demand next week.
    Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 5.0 cents,
or 3.0%, to settle at $1.640 per million British thermal units. That keeps the contract within a nickel
of its $1.602 close on March 23, its lowest settle since September 1995.
    For the month, prices slipped about 2% in March, putting the contract down for a fifth month in a row
for the first time since July 2019. During that time the contract has lost about 37%. For the quarter,
prices were down about 25% in the first quarter of 2020 after falling about 6% last quarter. That was the
contract's biggest quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 2014.
expected to return once governments loosen travel and work restrictions. Calendar 2021 has traded at a
premium over calendar 2022 for 14 days and over 2025 for four days.
    Even before the coronavirus started to cut global economic growth and demand for energy, gas was
to leave more gas in storage, making fuel shortages and price spikes unlikely.
    With the coming of spring-like weather, data provider Refinitiv projected gas demand in the U.S.
this week to 92.9 bcfd next week. That compares with Refinitiv's forecast on Monday of 97.9 bcfd this
week and 94.9 bcfd next week.
    The amount of gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants eased to 9.1 bcfd on Monday from 9.3 bcfd on
will not prevent output from hitting a record high this year.
    Gas production is expected to average a record 95.3 bcfd in 2020 before falling to 92.6 bcfd in 2021.
If correct, that would be the first decline in U.S. output since 2016 and compares with the current
all-time annual high of 92.2 bcfd in 2019, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration
