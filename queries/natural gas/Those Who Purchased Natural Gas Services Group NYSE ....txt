We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But unfortunately, some companies simply don’t succeed. For example, after five long years the Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. ( NYSE:NGS ) share price is a whole 62% lower. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 51%. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 33% in thirty days. Importantly, this could be a market reaction to the recently released financial results. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report .
Given that Natural Gas Services Group only made minimal earnings in the last twelve months, we’ll focus on revenue to gauge its business development. Generally speaking, we’d consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.
In the last five years Natural Gas Services Group saw its revenue shrink by 9.9% per year. That puts it in an unattractive cohort, to put it mildly. Arguably, the market has responded appropriately to this business performance by sending the share price down 18% (annualized) in the same time period. We don’t generally like to own companies that lose money and don’t grow revenues. You might be better off spending your money on a leisure activity. You’d want to research this company pretty thoroughly before buying, it looks a bit too risky for us.
Investors in Natural Gas Services Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 51%, against a market gain of about 0.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year’s performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 18% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.
