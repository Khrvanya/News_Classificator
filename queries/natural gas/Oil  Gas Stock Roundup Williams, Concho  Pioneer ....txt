Oil & Gas Stock Roundup: Williams, Concho & Pioneer Natural Report Q4 Earnings
It was a week when both oil and natural gas prices settled higher.
On the news front, The Williams Companies, Inc. WMB, Pioneer Natural Resources PXD and Concho Resources CXO reported December quarter earnings.
Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 2% to close at $53.38 per barrel, natural gas prices gained 3.7% in the week to finish at 1.905 per million Btu (MMBtu).
The crude benchmark rose for the second week in a row after a data report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in domestic supplies. Further, Trump administration’s sanctions on the trading unit of Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft and China’s economic stimulus package had a positive effect on prices. These factors were partly offset by the rumored rift in the alliance between Russia and Saudi Arabia-led producer group and increased concerns over fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would have a severe impact on oil demand
Meanwhile, natural gas ended slightly higher following an in-line decrease in supplies and bullish weather forecasts.
1.  Energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies reported fourth-quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 24 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny owing to weaker West segment performance.
However, the bottom line was above the year-earlier quarter's adjusted earnings of 19 cents on strong contribution from the energy infrastructure provider’s Atlantic-Gulf and Northeast G&P units. On a further encouraging note, Williams’ gathered volumes were up 10% year over year to a record 13.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), while reserved transportation capacity improved 8% from the corresponding period of 2018 to 21.8 Bcf/d – another all-time high.
The company reaffirmed its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in the band of $4.95-$5.25 billion with distributable cash flow within $3.05-$3.45 billion. Adjusted EPS view for the year is expected in the range of 95 cents to $1.20. Further, Williams expects to grow its dividend at an annual rate of 5% and aims toward a dividend coverage ratio of 1.7x at the midpoint of its 2020 guidance. Importantly, the company looks to cover its dividend hike and capital spending in 2020 with internally generated cash flows. (Read more Williams Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates, Tops on Revenues)

3. Concho Resources reported net income per share (excluding special items) of $1.03, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents and the prior-year period earnings of 94 cents. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to better-than-anticipated production volumes. Precisely, the Permian-focused upstream player’s output of 337,288 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 325,265 Boe/d.
In more good news for investors, the crude and natural gas explorer raised its quarterly dividend by 60% to 20 cents per share (or 80 cents per share annualized), to be paid out on on Mar 27 to shareholders of record as of Feb 28.

4. Cenovus Energy Inc. CVE reported fourth-quarter 2019 loss per share of 10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of profit was pegged at 8 cents. The Canadian integrated energy firm’s weaker-than-expected quarterly results were primarily owing to higher transportation and blending expenses along with lower margins from the Refining and Marketing business. The bottom line, however, was narrower than loss of $1.03 per share in fourth-quarter 2018, driven by higher oil sand production volumes.
Transportation and blending expenses in the reported quarter increased to C$1,416 million from C$1,269 million in the year-ago quarter. However, expenses for purchased products fell to C$2,059 million from C$2,555 million.
The company incurred total capital expenditure of C$317 million in the quarter under review. Notably, Cenovus generated $361 million in free funds flow. As of Dec 31, 2019, the Canadian energy player had cash and cash equivalents of C$186 million, and total long-term debt of C$6,699 million. Its total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 25.9%.
