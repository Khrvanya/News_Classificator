BEECH BOTTOM – Officials with the state Division of Highways released details about the natural gas fire that caused W.Va. 2 between Wellsburg and Beech Bottom to be closed Monday night.
“Crews were working on tie back anchors as part of the construction of the pile and lagging wall on the Wellsburg Bridge project when they drilled into a pocket of methane gas, causing flames to come out of the holes,” said Mike Witherow, DOH district construction engineer.
“While the flames dissipated, an odor remained, so as a precaution, emergency management (officials) closed state Route 2 overnight for it to bleed off,” he said, adding no one was injured by the                      flames.
The road was reopened at approximately 6:30 a.m., Tuesday.
Witherow said the anchor was being drilled from an approximately 30 degree angle at a depth of 80 feet.
The work is part of a retaining wall included in the $131 million construction of a new Ohio River bridge between an area about a mile south of Wellsburg and the south end of Brilliant.
State highway officials said the wall will extend north and south of the future span, allow the highway to be extended west toward the Ohio River and form a link between a bicycle lane on the bridge and the Brooke County Pioneer Trail below.
Crews with the Flatiron Corp. of Broomfield, Colo., have been building the bridge’s 830-foot, 4,000-ton main span in an area just south of Wellsburg.
Once the bridge’s piers are completed, it will be transported down river by barge and lifted onto them with high-powered jacks.
