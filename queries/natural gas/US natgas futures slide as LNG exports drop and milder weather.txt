June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures slipped on Monday on forecasts for lower air
conditioning demand and liquefied natural gas exports than previously expected.
    That price decline came despite a slowdown in output.
    Front-month gas futures fell 2.3 cents, or 1.3%, to $1.759 per million British thermal units
    Refinitiv said gas production in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell to an average of 88.5 billion cubic
of 95.4 bcfd in November.
    In the Gulf of Mexico, output dipped about 0.6 bcfd over the weekend to around 15.4 bcfd as Tropical
Storm Cristobal hit the Louisiana coast on Sunday.
    With the coming of milder weather in mid-June, Refinitiv projected U.S. demand, including exports,
would slide from 81.1 bcfd this week to 80.5 bcfd next week. That was lower than Refinitiv's forecasts
    The amount of pipeline gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants fell to an average of 4.2 bcfd so far
in European gas prices. After dropping to a record low in late May, major European
benchmarks have soared around 60% so far in June, making gas in Europe more
expensive than in the United States for all forward months for the first time since late April.
    When U.S. gas was trading at a premium to the European benchmarks in May, some energy firms decided
to send at least a couple of cargoes to the United States for storage.
