What role does natural gas play in Russian foreign policy and domestic politics? This article takes an in-depth look at the last two decades of Russian gas policy as a period of change and as a challenge to Gazprom’s Russian gas domination over its main market, Europe. Within this framework, the paper focuses on four main themes: 1) Gazprom’s position vis-à-vis its domestic competitors, including challenges to Gazprom export monopoly ; 2) the changing nature of natural gas markets and its impact on the position of Russian gas in Europe; 3) policy challenges to Russian gas exports to Europe; and 4) Russian gas exports’ pivot to China.
