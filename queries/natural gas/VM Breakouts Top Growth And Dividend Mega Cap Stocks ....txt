Releasing two top mega-cap stocks from the Growth & Dividend breakout portfolio for long-term gain potential into 2020.
The June portfolio finishes the first month +2.10% with 3 of 5 selections positive, led by AMP +7.12%, LUV +6.48%, and AMGN +2.68% plus high dividends over 2% for each.
The April portfolio is up +21.2% with all the picks in positive double-digits, led by KLAC +35.3%, BLK +23.7%, LLY +18.4%, AMGN +16.3%.
The Top Dividend Growth stock model expands on my doctoral research analysis on multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) adding new complexities with these top picks. Research shows that the highest frequency of large price breakout moves is found among small-cap stocks with low trading volumes offering no dividends and delivering higher-than-average risk levels. The challenge with the Top Dividend Growth model is to deliver a combination toward optimal total return with characteristics that typically reduce the frequency and size of price breakouts, but deliver more reliable growth factors for higher profitability longer term.
These 5 stocks have a minimum $10 billion market cap, $2/share price, 500k average daily volume and at least a 2% dividend yield. The population of this unique segment is approximately 330 stocks out of over 7,800 stocks across the US stock exchanges. While these stocks represent less than 5% of available stocks, their market cap exceeds $19 trillion out of the approximately $33 trillion (57.6%) of the US stock exchanges. Efforts are made to optimize total returns on the key MDA price growth factors (fundamental, technical, sentiment) for the best results under these large-cap constraints with high priorities for dividend growth and dividend yield.
Unlike many other market-based selection approaches, these picks are based on a proprietary algorithm using key variables across fundamental, technical, and behavioral finance characteristics. The justification for the selections is detailed in the research analysis link above that explains the algorithm and variable approach. Much of the narrative detailed below has been added to provide readers with familiar measures to consider for your own due diligence.
