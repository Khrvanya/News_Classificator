Natural gas prices moved lower on Friday, dropping more than3% for the day and down 11% for the week. A larger than expected build in natural gas inventories, in conjunction with warmer than normal weather, has led prices lower. The weather over the next 8-14 days is expected to be warmer than normal according to the most recent report from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration.
Natural gas prices tumbled more than 11% this week, keeping pace with the drop in the equity markets. A decline in LNG exports is reducing demand in conjunction with warmer than normal weather. Target support is the 2016 lows at 1.61. A break of this level would be a fresh low on natural gas prices. Resistance is seen near the 10-week moving average at 1.95.
Weekly momentum is negative as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the red with a downward sloping trajectory which points to lower prices. The fast stochastic generated a crossover sell signal in oversold territory. The current reading on the fast stochastic is 4.4, well below the oversold trigger level of 20 which could foreshadow a correction.
Th EIA reported that net withdrawal from storage totaled 143 Bcf for the week ending February 21, compared with the five-year average net withdrawal of 122 Bcf and last yearâ€™s net withdrawal of 167 Bcf during the same week. Working natural gas stocks totaled 2,200 Bcf, which is 179 Bcf more than the five-year average and 637 Bcf more than last year at this time. The average rate of withdrawal from storage is 9% lower than the five-year average so far in the withdrawal season. If the rate of withdrawal from storage matched the five-year average of 8.3 Bcf/d for the remainder of the withdrawal season, the total inventory would be 1,876 Bcf on March 31, which is 179 Bcf higher than the five-year average of 1,697 Bcf for that time of year.
