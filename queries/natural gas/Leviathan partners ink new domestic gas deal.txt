The partnership developing Israelâ€™s Leviathan offshore gas field has inked a new domestic supply, increasing the number of local deals to 14, the companies said on Tuesday.
Under the five-year deal, Leviathan will supply Israeli conglomerate, Haifa Group, with 0.06 billion cubic meters per year (Bcm/y) of natural gas. The supply is estimated at $55 million, Kallanish Energy reports.
The field is operated by Noble Energy in partnership with Delek Drilling and Ratio Oil. Last December, it began exports to Jordan and Egypt, under long-term supply agreements.
Leviathan will produce 1.2 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of gas during its first phase of development. The reservoir is estimated to hold recoverable resources of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas.
