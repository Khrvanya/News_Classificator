It is going to take a heck of a winter to ease the pain for natural-gas investors and producers.
Dragged down by a supply glut, U.S. natural-gas futures recently suffered their longest losing streak since at least 1990, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The front-month gas futures contract fell 12 consecutive trading sessions through Oct. 2, a period in which it declined around 16%. Prices are down 30% from their levels a year ago.
