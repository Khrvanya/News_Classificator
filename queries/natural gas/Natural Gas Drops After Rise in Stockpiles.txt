Natural-gas prices slid Thursday, pausing a recent recovery after weekly inventory figures showed a larger-than-expected increase last week.
Natural gas for June delivery closed down 2.6% at $1.894 a million British thermal units. Despite their drop over the past two sessions, prices are up 22% from a recent low hit on April 2. Some traders are hopeful that lower supply as a result of shut-ins of oil wells will spur a price rebound.
