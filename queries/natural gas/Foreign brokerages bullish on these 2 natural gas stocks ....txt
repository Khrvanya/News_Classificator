Motilal Oswal bullish on HDFC, expects firm to see lower competitive intensity in HFCs
"Going forward, the announcement of key macro data (Q2FY20 GDP) later this week could induce some volatility in the markets. On the global front, hopes of a positive outcome of the US-China trade deal have heightened which will keep the market participants on edge. Besides, investors will keep an eye on currency and crude price movement. Since the markets are near all-time high we may witness consolidation going forward," said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have remained net buyers during the month buying equities worth Rs 13,765.40 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sold equities of Rs 9,207.95 crore.

"We could see continuation of the current up move on the back of rebalancing of MSCIâ€™s portfolio. Metal index is exhibiting exceptional strength; traders should keep the metal basket on their radar. Technically, above 12,040, Nifty would halt between 12,150 and 12,200 levels. Any weakness from current levels would be buying opportunity with a medium-term view," said Shrikant Chouhan, Senior Vice-President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities.
