Playa del Carmen, Q.R. — A natural gas line more than a kilometer long is being installed underground along Fifth Avenue during the remodeling of the area.
David Duarte Castilla, secretary of the Ordenamiento Territorial Municipal y Sustentabilidad del municipio de Solidaridad, confirmed the installation of the six-inch diameter natural gas line. He says the line, which will extend more than a kilometer, is being installed this week so that in the future, they can use it for distribution.
Duarte Castilla explained that the line is being placed by Gas Natural del Noreste, who is taking advantage of the fact the roadway has been torn up by city council for remodeling.
“The objective of this line is to take advantage of the fact that we have removed the paving, the concrete. The natural gas option can be distributed to the service providers of Quinta Avenida without having to cause damage when the line is finished,” he added.
He clarified that for now, the infrastructure will not be used, but will run from avenida Primera Bis to la calle 14, which is the main section where city council carries out public works.
“The line is not going to operate. The only thing that is being taken advantage of is that as we do not have pavement, so the line is being introduced and in the future we have the option to offer natural gas, which is cheaper than butane gas and has many virtues because it does not need tank storage, but it is not something that is going to be used in the present, only in the future,” he explained.
Lenin Amaro Betancourt, president of the Business Coordinating Council, says she regrets that a project of such importance has not been publicly announced in advance, like many projects that the current administration has undertaken.
