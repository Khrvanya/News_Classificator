U.S. natgas futures climb as LNG exports rise, Gulf of Mexico storm
June 5 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures climbed on Friday along with other energy contracts as
liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports rose and a storm brewed in the Gulf of Mexico.
    That gas price increase, however, came despite forecasts for milder weather and lower air
conditioning demand in mid June.
    Front-month gas futures rose 2.6 cents, or 1.4%, to $1.848 per million British thermal units
first time since April 2019.
    For the week, the front-month was down less than 1% after rising almost 7% last week.

    Refinitiv said gas production in the U.S. Lower 48 states fell to an average of 88.6 billion cubic
of 95.4 bcfd in November.
    With the coming of milder weather in mid June, Refinitiv projected U.S. demand, including exports,
would rise from 81.2 bcfd this week to 82.2 bcfd next week before sliding to 81.6 bcfd in two weeks.
    The amount of pipeline gas flowing to U.S. LNG export plants was on track to reach 5.0 bcfd on
Friday after dropping to a 13-month low of 3.7 bcfd on Monday. That compares with an eight-month low of
6.4 bcfd in May and a monthly record high of 8.7 bcfd in February.
