In 2019, total energy consumption in the Netherlands stood at 3,080 petajoules (PJ), more or less the same as in the previous year. Consumption of coal dropped by over 22 percent, the largest decline since 2000. Natural gas consumption, on the other hand, rose to 1,360 PJ. Meanwhile, the Netherlands is increasingly making use of natural gas from abroad. The natural gas trade deficit went up to more than 340 PJ last year, while it still amounted to 190 PJ in 2018. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) reports this based on the most recent energy balance figures.
The energy balance comprises supply, conversion and consumption of energy. Energy is released for example during combustion of natural gas, petroleum, coal and biofuels, or is produced from wind or solar power (energy carriers).
The share of natural gas in Dutch energy consumption increased in 2019, after it had been more or less stable for a number of years. Last year, natural gas held a share of 44 percent in total energy consumption (versus 41 percent in 2018). Petroleum remained in second place with a slight decline from 38 to 36 percent. The contribution of coal has diminished as of 2016 and saw a further decline to 9 percent of energy consumption in 2019. Just as in 2018, the three fossil energy carriers combined were good for around 90 percent of total energy consumption. The other energy sources are renewable energy, nuclear energy, waste and net electricity imports. Their combined share has been growing slightly since 2010 (when it stood at over 6 percent).
