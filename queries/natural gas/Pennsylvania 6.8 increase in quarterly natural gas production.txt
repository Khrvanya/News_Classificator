Home Topics Company News Pennsylvania:  6.8% increase in quarterly natural gas production
Pennsylvania has reported a 6.8% increase in quarterly natural gas production, Kallanish Energy reports.
Production grew to 1,766 billion cubic feet in first quarter 2020 from Q1 2019, said the new report from the Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office.
Production in Q1 2019 was 1,654 billion cubic feet, it said.
That 6.8% growth rate is the state’s lowest since 2017, it said.
It also said that year-over-year growth rates have slowed from the 17.8% growth rate recorded in Q4 2018, dipping to the 6.8%.
Production in Q1 2020 also dipped slightly from the 1,775 billion cubic feet in Q4 2019.
That is the first quarter-to-quarter decline in more than three years in Pennsylvania, it said.
A total of 153 new horizontal wells were spud in the state in Q1 2020, the IFO reported. That is a reduction of 45 wells or 22.7% from Q1 2019, it said.
It was the fourth straight quarter with a year-over-year decline in new wells spud.
The reduction is likely due to low natural gas prices and the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, it said.
The IFO reported that Pennsylvania had 9,941 operating horizontal wells, mostly in the Marcellus Shale, in Q1 2020. That is up 7.5% from 1Q 2019. That total includes 9,470 horizontal wells, up 8% from Q1 2019.
That is the smallest increase in quarterly horizontal wells on record and is likely due to decelerating growth in wells due to less drilling and older wells being shut in or plugged, it said.
The top gas-producing counties in Pennsylvania in Q1 2020 were Susquehanna, 404 billion cubic feet; Washington, 289 billion cubic feet; Greene, 284 billion cubic feet; Bradford, 222 billion cubic feet; and Lycoming, 105 billion cubic feet.
Production dropped in Susquehanna and Washington counties in Q1 2020 from Q1 2019, while increasing in the three other counties.
It is the first recorded quarterly production loss on record for Susquehanna County.
Greene County accounted for one third of the state’s quarterly production increase.
Susquehanna and Washington counties each have more than 1,500 operating wells.
The next five counties were Tioga, Wyoming, Butler, Allegheny and Sullivan.
The Pennsylvania report excludes vertical-only wells that account for less than 1% of production.
Pennsylvania is No. 2 in the United States for natural gas production behind only Texas.
Alaska is third, followed by Oklahoma and Louisiana.
