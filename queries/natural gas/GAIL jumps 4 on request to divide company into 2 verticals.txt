GAIL is India's biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm.
GAIL's core business after the bifurcation would be the marketing of natural gas and petrochemical production.
Earlier in February, PTI quoting sources suggested that the Oil Ministry had moved a cabinet note seeking approval for hiving off the state-owned gas utility GAIL's pipeline business into a separate entity for a possible sale to a strategic investor at a later date.
At 2 pm, the scrip was trading 4.05 per cent higher at Rs 96.40 on BSE.
GAIL is India's biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm and owns more than 70 per cent of the country's 16,981-km pipeline network, giving it a stranglehold on the market.
GAIL's core business after the bifurcation would be the marketing of natural gas and petrochemical production. It will have to hire capacity on pipelines from the subsidiary and pay regulator approved traffics for the same, a PTI report had said in February this year.
The company will continue to execute the gas sales agreements it has already signed and will be responsible for the discharge of the obligation under purchase pacts including for import of LNG.
