Foreign travel is not yet possible for Britons despite lockdown easing, with major holiday money providers not yet offering foreign currency services - although this could be set to change imminently.
The UK government’s advice continues to caution against non-essential travel.
However, with domestic tourism already given the all-clear from July 4, it’s hoped an update concerning international travel will be announced in the coming days.
The government is hoping to set up a series of ‘air bridges’ with other countries to facilitate safe travel in the wake of coronavirus.

On Wednesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explained these travel corridors would only be established with nations which have a coronavirus test and trace system equal to the UK’s.
The countries would also need to have a low rate of the virus.
Currently, anyone entering the UK has to quarantine for 14 days in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus.
This is set to be reviewed on June 29 after which it is hoped the ‘air bridges’ will be set up.
According to reports from The Sun, this is when the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) will change their travel advice.
It should shift from “against all but essential international travel” to allowing travel to these safe countries.
