Euro 2020 won't be happening this year but you can play out the tournament virtually for free on PS4 or Xbox One.
While the planned boxed edition has been knocked on the head, PES have confirmed that the official Euro 2020 video game has been made available to download now and contains all 55 participating UEFA national teams as well as new features such as the match ball.
With the official licence, as well as new stadiums such as Wembley Stadium and the Gazprom Arena, gamers can host their very own European Championship tournament on a variety of game modes.
Gazprom Arena was created around 20/08/2019 according to the game files, while Wembley Stadium is created around the 02/02/20 (so a short time ago). It seems to have been completely redesigned without having any common assets with its PES 2014 version. #PES2020 #eFootballPES2020 pic.twitter.com/Z0JWdqTa2U

The add-on is downloadable for no extra cost as long as the player already has PES 2020 and if they do it should automatically arrive to their console of choice as part of the latest update.
It's a tidy investment to cure some serious boredom while in lockdown, especially given the real-life tournament has been postponed until next year.
EA Sports had the last European Championship mode added onto FIFA 2016 as well as the 2018 World Cup but it's Konami who stole a march by acquiring the rights to the next big tournament.
Pushed back a year, Euro 2020 will retain the same name and take place across 12 cities in Europe - with Wembley hosting the semi-final and final.
