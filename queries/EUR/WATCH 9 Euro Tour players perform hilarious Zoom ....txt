Martin Kaymer leads a hilarious Zoom call in the European Tour's latest social media spoof video.
As the world has been upended over the last few months by the coronavirus pandemic, Zoom and other video conferencing platforms have become a newly ubiquitous part of life for many, both professionally and socially.
The European Tour has made a name for itself in recent years by producing a slew of viral content, from the popular Hole-in-One and 14-Club Challenges to interviews with the Awkward Reporter . On Monday, the Tour produced yet another hilarious edition to the canon: The Conference Call.
The premise: Martin Kaymer attempts to gather eight of his Tour peers (Henrik Stenson, Colin Montgomerie, Padraig Harrington , Tommy Fleetwood, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose , Lee Westwood and Gary Player) for an important discussion on some logistics concerning the upcoming BMW PGA Championship. The problem? As everyone knows, when gathering any sizeable group on Zoom, chaos easily reigns.
The best part about this video is the way each of the participants is willing to laugh at himself — or rather, the perceptions others have about them. Kaymer plays the straight man, exasperated by the antics of the others on the call, while the rest are free to ham it up.
Fleetwood is great as the Zoomer who can’t stop making distracting noises, interrupting the meeting with a blender, a hair dryer, and by tending to his toddler son. Harrington gets a laugh as an inept video conferencer whose frustrated profanity is luckily muted by a poor connection. Rose gets to poke fun at his image as Mr. Polished Professional, by first praising Kaymer for getting everyone together for the meeting, then forgetting to mute his microphone as he drops a F-bomb while lamenting how lame and unorganized Kaymer’s meeting is.
