“We fight against the deficit of the cash currency caused by the interruptions in the air traffic. The NBU has purchased the currency in euro; today we will hold the auction to enable the banks to exchange the non-cash currency for cash. Besides, we agree with the counterparts from the U.S. on the supply of a significant batch of dollars. The NBU does not print dollars and euros so we need to expect the supply,” the message said.
The NBU announced the cancelation of the tariffs for reinforcement of the banks with cash and temporary cancelation of the tariffs in the system of the electronic payments. Thus, non-cash payments will become cheaper than cash.
Earlier, the National Bank of Ukraine stated about signs of the shortage of cash currency in the banks . It is caused by the increase of the demand of the population for cash currency.
Due to the stop of the air transportation and closure of the border, cash dollars and euros are supplied to Ukraine with delay.
