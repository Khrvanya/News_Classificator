MADRID (Reuters) - Spain plans a 3.7 billion euro aid package for its automobile sector, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, to promote investment and the purchase of vehicles, specially electric models, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday.
Sanchez said details of the plan, which will also include fiscal and research measures, would be announced on Monday for a sector that accounts for a tenth of Spainâ€™s national output and close to a fifth of its exports.
The lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, has battered car sales in Spain.
