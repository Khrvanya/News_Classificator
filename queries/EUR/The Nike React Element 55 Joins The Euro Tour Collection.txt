While little has been officially revealed about it, NIKE, Inc.’s footwear “tour” through Europe will soon include the Nike React Element 55 .
Akin to a previously-surfaced Jordan 1 Mid and Jordan Air Max 200 , the lifestyle-oriented silhouette is clad in a “White” that sets the stage for more vibrant accents. Silver synthetic overlays appear across the React Element 55 ‘s heel and underneath the lace guards; cities such as London, St. Petersburg, and Rome are referenced on the tongue in a similar shimmering fashion. Elsewhere, “University Red” details throughout the throat and bright blue stitching and heel pull tabs further interrupt the pair’s predominantly-colorless arrangement, just as the lateral “Midnight Navy” Swoosh. Yet, the light grey pattern all over the mesh upper may be this “Euro Tour” option’s most notable feature. Underfoot, Nike React foam indulges in a tried-and-tested “White” scheme complemented with light grey at high-wear zones.
A release date has yet to be confirmed, but this React Element 55 “Euro Tour” is likely to launch on Nike.com in the coming weeks. For now, enjoy detailed images of the pair here below.
In other news from The Swoosh, the Nike Space Hippie line launches stateside on July 3rd.
