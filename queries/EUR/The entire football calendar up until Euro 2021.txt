The football calendar for the remainder of the 2019/20 season and also the 2020/21 campaign was released, as UEFA set the dates for the Europa League, Champions League and European Super Cup.
UEFA also set the schedule for international football, which includes national team matches and the European Championship.
In addition, UEFA approved a health protocol aimed at ensuring the health of all match participants.
For this reason, the matches will initially be played behind closed doors.
"I am delighted that we can resume almost all of our competitions," said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.
The quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of the Champions League will be played in a direct knockout format at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon between August 12 and 23, 2020.
The remaining second leg of the last-16 ties will be played on August 7 and 8, although it has not yet been decided whether these matches will be played at home or in Portugal.
In addition to the Jose Alvalade, the Estadio Afonso Henriques de Guimaraes and the Estadio do Dragao have been added due to their importance in the last 16.
The quarter-finals will be played on August 12, 13, 14 and 15; the semi-finals on August 18 and 19; and the final will be played on August 23 at Benfica's home. All matches will start at 21:00 CEST.

As far as the Spanish top flight is concerned, in principle the competition is scheduled to start on September 12, as announced by LaLiga president Javier Tebas.
The calendar is conditioned by the European Championship, which will be disputed in the summer of 2021. That will cause the competition to end in May.
There is no date yet for this season's Copa del Rey final between Athletic Club and Real Sociedad.
The Supercopa de Espana is scheduled for January and will be played in Saudi Arabia. The participants will be Athletic, Real Sociedad and the top two in LaLiga Santander in 2019/20.
The start of the next edition of the Champions League has also been altered.
The competition will start with the preliminary round on August 8 and 11.
The same goes for the Europa League.
The 12 original host cities have been confirmed as venues for the finals of the tournament in the summer of 2021, and the updated match schedule was also approved accordingly.
The dates are the same as the ones that had been set for 2020.
All the tickets that had been sold will be valid.
The international breaks in October and November 2020 will now feature three matches instead of two, allowing the postponed European qualifier play-off matches to be rescheduled at the start of the respective windows on October 8 and November 12.
The UEFA Nations League 2020/21 group stage matches will be played on the following match days: September 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; October 10, 11, 13 and 14; and November 14, 15, 17 and 18.
