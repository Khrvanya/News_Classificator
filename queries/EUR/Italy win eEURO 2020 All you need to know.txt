Italy defeated Serbia in the final to win the inaugural UEFA eEURO; get the lowdown here.
Italy have emerged triumphant to be crowned the winners of UEFA eEURO 2020, beating Serbia in the final to clinch the inaugural eEuropean Championship.
Represented by a team of four gamers – AlonsoGrayfox, Naples17x, Nicaldan and Genoa_Npk02 – Italy were consistently impressive in the virtual final tournament, played on Konami's efootball PES 2020 on Playstation 4. Beaten just once in qualifying, the Azzurri dispatched Israel in the quarter-finals and France in the last four to set up their showdown with Serbia.
Serbia had got past Spain and Romania in the previous rounds but were immediately on the back foot as AlonsoGrayfox saw off RoksaCzv22 at the start of the decider, a best-of-five series. Kepa_PFC then levelled the contest for Serbia against Genoa_Npk02, before Nicaldan edged RoksaCzv22 1-0 and Naples17x downed Kepa_PFC with a last-minute goal in a 2-1 victory.
"It was a great emotion," said Italy player AlonsoGrayfox after the final. "It was incredible to have come to this point, and now we have won it. I cannot express my feelings in words. The decisive game for us was the one against France in the semi-finals. That victory gave us self-confidence. I'm proud to be Italian, and I'm proud to be Sardinian. It's incredible, I still cannot believe we did it – it's a dream."
