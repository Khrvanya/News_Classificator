West Virginia’s latest football commitment is Edward Vesterinen – another in a growing group of European players to pledge to the Mountaineer program.

A resident of Helsinki, Finland, Vesterinen joins Jairo Faverus, a defensive back from The Netherlands as part of the Mountaineers’ class of 2020, who enrolled at WVU this past January. Tight end Viktor Wikstrom of Sweden is committed to WVU’s 2021 class.
Vesterninen also fits into another growing group of players in West Virginia recruiting classes – that of defensive ends who have good mobility and could play in either two- or three-point stances. The stockpiling of such players will give WVU more options at its hybrid bandit position, and also provide a path to other defensive line spots if recruits fill out and gain the size and strength to battle from traditional three-point stances closer to the ball on the defensive front.
Vesterinen claims a 40-yard dash time of 4.75, and while that’s difficult to verify from game highlights, he does show a good start and pursuit skills after getting inside blocks off the line of scrimmage. He has highlights from both two- and three-point stances to show, and while his arm positioning is a bit unconventional at times when he gets into space, he displays a good sense of where is is and being aware of opponents when setting the edge and pursuing down the line.
On the pass rush, his quickness is his current best asset. He excels with an outside fake and an inside move, and shows the ability to bull rush, create contact and then discard his opponent quickly to get pressure into the backfield.
Vesterinen’s agility is also evident in his offensive line highlights, where he played tackle previously before moving into a sole defensive role last year.
