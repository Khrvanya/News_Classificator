The EUR/USD has been trapped within the range as 1.1200 zone still resists. We have the important zone within 1.1200 and at this point we might see a push to the upside or a break below. If the market breaks 1.1200, next is 1.1188 followed by 1.1168. Below 1.1168 a stronger momentum down is expected towards 1.1118. Above 1.1200, 1.1227 is next followed by 1.1240 and 1.1267. Only above 1.1267 we should see 1.1316 again.
