LONDON — A group of 16 euro zone banks on Thursday said a “truly European” payments system was expected to be up and running in 2022 in a region where half of all retail payments are still in cash.
European Union policymakers and central bankers have long sought a “home grown” rival to take on Mastercard and Visa from the United States, and more recently tech giants like Alipay and Google. But this has not happened even though real-time payments have been possible in the euro zone since 2017.

“The solution aims to become a new standard means of payment for European consumers and merchants in all types of transactions including in-store, online, cash withdrawal and ‘peer-to-peer’ in addition to existing international payment scheme solutions,” the banks said in a joint statement.
Banks that have already signed up include BBVA, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank , Santander, ING, UniCredit and Societe Generale.
In coming weeks the project will set up an interim company in Brussels, with other payment service providers invited to join, the statement said.
The so-called European Payments Initiative is expected to become operational during 2022.
“EPI’s objective is to offer a digital payment solution that can be used anywhere in Europe and to supersede the fragmented landscape that currently still exists,” the statement said. (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alex Richardson. Editing by Jane Merriman)
