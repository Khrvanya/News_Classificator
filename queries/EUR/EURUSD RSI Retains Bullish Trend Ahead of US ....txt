EUR/USD appears to be stuck in a narrow range ahead of the update to the US Non-Farm Payrolls ( NFP ) report, but a bull flag formation may unfold over the coming days as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to track the bullish trend from earlier this year.
EUR / USD is little changed from earlier this week even though European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist Philip Lane insists that the Euro Area is in “the second stage of recovery,” and it remains to be seen if the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report will influence the exchange rate as employment is expected to increase for the second consecutive month.
The US economy is anticipated to add 3 million jobs in June following the 2.5 million expansion the month prior, and a positive development may trigger a bullish reaction in the US Dollar as it undermines speculation for additional monetary support.
The European Central Bank (ECB) may follow a similar path as board member Lane anticipates “a long period where the data should be mostly positive,” and it seems as though the central bank has little intentions of implementing more non-standard tools as the official speaks out against a yield-curve control program.
Lane asserts that “you can only target the yield if you promise to buy everything, which we do not,” and the comments suggest the ECB will carry out a wait-and-see approach as board member Yves Mersch reveals that “a COVID-19 recovery fund “would reduce the burden on monetary policy and the need for further easing of the policy stance.”
Looking ahead, the ECB may stick to the same script at the next meeting on July 16 as European Council President Charles Michel vows to ‘start real negotiations with the member states, and will convene an in-person summit, around mid-July in Brussels,’ but the central bank may stand ready to “adjust all of its instruments” as Governing Council officials rule out a V-shape recovery.
Nevertheless, the reluctance to implement lower interest rates may keep EUR/USD afloat as President Christine Lagarde and Co. appear to be on track to retain the current policy, and the exchange rate may stage another attempt to test the March high (1.1495) as a bull flag formation takes shape, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) clings to the bullish trend from March.
