USD/JPY was on a smooth short-side trend until the latter-portion of this week brought a long-term support zone into the mix.
Bigger picture, USD / JPY presents breakdown potential as horizontal support combined with lower-highs may soon give way to persistent selling pressure.
Given the fireworks from February-March, it appears that the short-side theme in USD/JPY would align with another round or a revival of risk aversion.
Despite the fireworks in financial markets that have shown so visibly over the past few months, USD/JPY has of recent been suspiciously quiet, especially when taking a longer-term look at the matter. Getting more granular, there are some trends on shorter-term charts that may have seemed workable but, focusing on net price action, USD/JPY has been grinding in a back-and-forth manner even as the world has went off of the proverbial rails over the past three months.
Taking a shorter-term look at the matter produces a far different result, particularly in the months of February and March which saw strong trends in either direction. But, given that monthly price action closed very near where it finished, this is merely presented as a long-legged doji for the March print on the monthly chart of USD/JPY. But the manner that these moves priced-in may offer some element of insight for strategy parameters moving forward.
As the world shuttered with fear as the coronavirus was getting priced in, USD/JPY tanked by more than 1,000 pips from the February high to the March 9th low. This correlates with the sell-off in stocks and the overall push of risk aversion; and when extrapolated to the Yen, this can make sense as the carry trade in USD/JPY faced aggressive unwind as the world prepared for rougher conditions ahead.
