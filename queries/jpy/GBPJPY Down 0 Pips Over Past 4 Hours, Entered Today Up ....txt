First things first: GBP/JPY crossed above its 20, 50 and 100 day moving averages yesterday. As for the alignment of the moving averages, well, it’s a bit mixed up; the 20, 50, 100, and 200 do not progress from largest to smallest, or vice versa. The closest is the 20 day average, which is 2.1 pips away. It should be noted, though, the 50 day simple moving average turned upwards, which may be a bullish sign. Volatility for GBP/JPY has been contracting over the past two weeks relative to volatility over the past month. Whether volatility reverts will be something to watch. The clearest trend exists on the 30 day timeframe, which shows price moving down over that time. Or to simplify this another way, note that out of the past 10 days GBP/JPY’s price has gone up 8 them. Also, candlestick traders! Note we see pin bar pattern appearing here as well.
