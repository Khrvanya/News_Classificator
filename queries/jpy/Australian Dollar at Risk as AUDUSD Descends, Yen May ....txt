Australian Dollar at Risk as AUD/USD Descends, Yen May Fall Ahead
The sentiment-linked Australian Dollar was one of the worst-performing major currencies Wednesday as Wall Street traded in the red. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones closed -4.41% and -4.44% to the downside respectively, reflecting a pessimistic mood that prevailed throughout the Asia Pacific and European sessions. This followed a warning from US President Donald Trump who alluded to a “painful” two weeks amid the coronavirus.
Demand for safety and liquidity boosted the haven-linked US Dollar and similarly-behaving Japanese Yen . There was a cautious boost in sentiment after gauges of US manufacturing activity printed more optimistic than anticipated. Nevertheless, selling pressure resumed course into the close as the growth-linked Canadian Dollar followed lower alongside the New Zealand Dollar .
S&P 500 futures are pointing higher heading into Thursday’s Asia Pacific trading session. The Federal Reserve announced that it will be temporarily excluding treasuries and deposits in leverage rules. This easing in capital requirements might have helped dim the sour mood in equities. This is as Trump could be looking into domestic travel limits for virus hot spots.
If the optimistic tone prevails, it could help to diminish anticipated losses in APAC equities such as the Nikkei 225 and ASX 200 . That may trim recent losses that AUD/ USD and NZD/USD experienced over the past 24 hours. This may also bode ill for the Japanese Yen. Follow-through is uncertain with global major benchmark stock indexes appearing to struggle with pushing through trend-defining resistance.
