China reported more cases of the coronavirus after U.S. close
The anti-risk Japanese Yen and haven-linked US Dollar were the best-performing major currencies on Friday and may gap higher as the new week begins. The S&P 500 closed 0.90 percent to the downside in its worst week since the middle of August. Sentiment-linked WTI crude oil prices followed, plunging about 2.5% as worries about the coronavirus spread into financial markets.
A third report of a person from the United States being diagnosed of the Wuhan virus fueled contagion fears. Europe’s first case was also reported in France. The concern for financial markets is that should citizens opt to stay home, particularly in China during the Lunar New Year holiday, it can dent revenue and hurt productivity. US Treasury prices generally rose, indicating a premium for safety.
Anti-fiat gold prices rallied, though a stronger Greenback likely depressed some of the precious metal’s full potential. There was a cautious pullback from the “pro-risk” Australian Dollar and New Zealand Dollar . Better-than-expected UK Markit Manufacturing PMI data temporarily lifted the British Pound , but it ultimately aimed lower against the US Dollar as the session prolonged.
