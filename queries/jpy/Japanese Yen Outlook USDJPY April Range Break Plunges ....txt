Japanese Yen Technical Price Outlook: Near-term Trade Levels
The Japanese Yen is poised to mark the seventh consecutive daily advance against the US Dollar with USD /JPY breaking to fresh monthly lows ahead of the April close. While the risk remains weighted to the downside, the decline is now testing near-term support and the focus is on a reaction off this level. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD /JPY technical price charts. Review my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Yen trade setup and more.

Techncial Outlook: In last month’s Japanese Yen Price Outlook we noted that the, “immediate focus is on a break of the monthly opening-range. That said, from a trading standpoint, look for topside exhaustion while below the yearly open IF price is indeed heading lower…” Last week’s opening-range held into the close with USD/JPY breaking below the monthly range-lows on Tuesday. The risk remains weighted to the downside while below monthly open-resistance at 107.49 with initial support eyed at the 2019 low-day close at 106.09 and the median-line of the broader descending pitchfork formation just lower near ~105.70s. Broader bearish invalidation steady at the yearly open / December lows at 108.42/62.
Notes: A closer look a Yen price action shows USDJPY trading within the confines of al near-term descending pitchfork formation extending off the monthly high with the recent decline now testing the 61.5% extension of the March decline at 106.42. Initial resistance now 106.92 backed by the upper parallel / April 16th swing low at 107.16- look for exhaustion ahead of this region IF price is indeed heading lower with a break exposing subsequent support objectives at the 2019 LDC at 106.10, the median-line and the 61.8% retracement of the March rally at 105.20- look for a bigger reaction there IF reached.
