Major Market Ranges for Week of May 31: Weak S&P Internals
Market internals symbols for stock indexes are printing lower lows today against actual indices’ higher highs. This negative divergence/imbalance in the “Advancers-Decliners” ratio ($ADD, $ADVN) hints at pullbacks.
Trade ideas based on candlestick pattern opinions include bearish weekly S&P 500 futures put spreads toward 3005, and long weekly Japanese yen futures call spreads.
Last week’s headline, “Rally Slows, Yen Trends” somewhat predicted this week’s markets in that the trading character of the Japanese Yen futures was trending, and indices dropped the day after the article posted. Indices then ran higher than my projected weekly range! 8/10 projected weekly ranges printed as of Thursday afternoon with other ranges extremely close.
Neutral-bear range technical opinions, VIX buy candle; sell call spread/buy put spread. 3005 as target.
Bullish range & candlesticks in triplicate on Daily chart. On 50-week average support. Long trade.
Neutral range. Weekly break over 20-,50-week averages, monthly bullish candlestick. Consider four-month Long trade possibility.
Bearish opinion, from three-day chart; neutral ranges here due to range box or weekly-chart pennant/flag. Daily chart is bullish. A bear trader could sell higher if the next move is upside; bulls can join it.
