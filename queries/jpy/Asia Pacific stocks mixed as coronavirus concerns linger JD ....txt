Investor reaction to a recent surge in Covid-19 cases stateside was watched on Thursday, with the number of coronavirus hospitalizations across Texas surging about 11% in a single day on Wednesday . A coronavirus model once cited by the White House also now projects projects more than 200,000 Americans could die of Covid-19 by Oct. 1.

"It is unclear how markets should react given the obvious high bar to re-impose restrictions in the US and states across the US are continuing to re-open their economies. High-frequency mobility indicators continue to point towards a pick-up in activity across in the US and including Texas," Tapas Strickland, director of economics at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note.
Comp the situation in China, Strickland said authorities in the country are "taking aggressive action" though the approach toward containing the virus' spread has been "more targeted" as compared to lockdown measures that were imposed in Wuhan — where the disease was first reported — earlier this year.
"Economies in Asia and the Pacific will continue to feel the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic this year even as lockdowns are slowly eased and select economic activities restart in a 'new normal' scenario," ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada said in the release.
"While we see a higher growth outlook for the region in 2021, this is mainly due to weak numbers this year, and this will not be a V-shaped recovery. Governments should undertake policy measures to reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 and ensure that no further waves of outbreaks occur," Sawada said.
