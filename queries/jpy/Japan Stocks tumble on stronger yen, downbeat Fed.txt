Japan share market finished session lower on Thursday, 11 June 2020, as investors continued cashing out market's recent gains on yen appreciation against greenback after a gloomy outlook from the US Federal Reserve challenged market optimism on the global economy.
At closing bell, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 652.04 points, or 2.82%, to 22,472.91. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 35.79 points, or 2.2%, at 1,588.92.
Investors assessed the Federal Reserve's forecast of a long road to recovery for the economy and loose monetary policy. The U. S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday opted to leave its interest rates unchanged and gave a gloomy outlook for the economy, forecasting the world's largest economy could shrink by as much as 6.5 percent this year before expanding by 5% in 2021. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell remarked that the central bank is "not even thinking about raising rates" and that interest rates are likely to remain near zero until the end of 2022. The central bank also said it will at least maintain the current rate of bond purchases.
