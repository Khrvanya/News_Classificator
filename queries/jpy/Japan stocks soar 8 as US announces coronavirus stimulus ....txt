The moves in the region came as the White House and Senate reached a deal on a gigantic $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill early Wednesday stateside.

So far, more than 375,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus while at least 16,362 lives have been taken, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization.
