USD/JPY DAILY PRICE CHART (MAY 1 – AUG 9, 2019) Zoomed in
Looking at the daily chart, we notice that on Thursday USD / JPY climbed to current trading zone 107.55- 110.52. On Tuesday, the price paused its rally and pointed lower. However, the market did not generate any bearish signal as the pair has not closed below the 50-day average yet.
A close below the low end of the zone could see USDJPY trading towards 104.72. Further close below that level could send the pair even lower towards 100.75. Having said that, the weekly support levels and area marked on the chart (zoomed in) should be kept in focus.
On the flip-side, any failure in closing below the low end of the zone may reverse the pair’s direction towards the high end of the zone. Further close above that level could mean more bullishness towards 113.57. In that scenario, the weekly resistance levels underscored on the chart should be monitored.
