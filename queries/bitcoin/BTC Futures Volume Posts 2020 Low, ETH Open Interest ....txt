BTC Futures Volume Posts 2020 Low, ETH Open Interest Surges
Daily trade volume for Bitcoin futures contracts has dropped to a new year-to-date low. However, open interest in both BTC and Ether futures are rallying into record highs.
Trade volume on Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures exchanges has plummeted to new lows for 2020, with the BTC futures markets collective posting just shy of $5 billion in 24-hour volume on June 13.
76% of futures trading took place on OKEx, Huobi, and Binance — representing $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.1 billion in volume, according to data published by market analysis firm Skew .
The slump in activity has seen volume drop by approximately half for two consecutive days.
While Bitcoin futures activity has slumped, open interest has recently reclaimed its levels prior to the violent Black Thursday crash during mid-March — testing $4 billion for the first time in three months.
Meanwhile, open interest in BTC options has broken into new highs, breaching $1.5 billion just one month after tagging ten-figures for the first time.
The record highs have been bolstered by a 3,000% spike in open interest on Chicago Mercantile Exchange during May.
