The subsidiary of Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings has increased their share of Bitcoin SV following the April 10 halving.
A subsidiary of Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings has seen its share of Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) mining pool share rise since the first halving on April 10.
According to cryptocurrency information site CoinDance , cryptocurrency mining company SBI Crypto held about 4.4% of the total shares of BSV last week, but those numbers jumped to 15.28% on April 13.
The halving of BSV comes just a short time after BCH's halving event on April 8, and approximately one month prior to Bitcoin's halving, expected between May 11-13.
Yoshitaka Kitao, Chief Executive Office (CEO) of SBI Holdings, is known for his friendship with Satoshi claimant Craig Wright , who backs BSV. However, when BSV hard-forked from Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in 2018, Kitao criticized the move, calling it a "meaningless split" that would lead to investors leaving.
Though SBI Holdings has demonstrated a heightened interest in digital currencies over the past months, the company’s registered crypto exchange in Japan will soon face regulatory challenges.
New laws for regulating cryptocurrencies in Japan are beginning to be enforced. The Payment Services Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, two of the pieces of legislation passed by the Japanese House of Representatives last year to regulate crypto, will come into effect on May 1.
