Bitcoin posts 3.5% daily gains as optimism starts trickling back into cryptocurrency markets and a crucial CME gap gets filled.
Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose above $8,000 on March 10 as markets worldwide began a seemingly miraculous recovery from Monday’s crash.
Data from Coin360 and Cointelegraph Markets showed BTC/USD reclaiming the $8,000 mark on Tuesday, having fallen to two-month lows of $7,625.
At press time, the pair traded at around $8,070, up 3.5% on the day while still 9% down versus the same time a week ago.
The boost for Bitcoin came hours after traditional markets appeared to shake off the panic which characterized the first trading day of the week. United States stocks, for example, all but canceled out Monday’s slump.
Cointelegraph Markets analyst Mati Greenspan summarized:
“The US Stock market has already recouped almost all of yesterday's historic losses.... Capitulation??”
Bitcoin’s trip to the $7,600 range meanwhile became significant for another reason. As various traders noted on Monday, $7,685 represented the final “gap” in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures markets.
The vacuum between the end of one futures trading session and the start of another, gaps left behind have a tendency to get “filled” by Bitcoin at a later date.
BTC/USD thus exactly filled the last gap remaining which was lower than the previous spot price. The only other gap is much higher — $11,790.
“There are now NO MORE GAPS below $BTC,” popular Twitter account The Moon commented on the events.
Others were more cautious. Fellow Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb said that while he had added to his position, he envisaged exiting once again at around $8,200.
“Position is obviously cautious until otherwise, but I have bought back in this morning with around 30% of capital allocated,” he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Tuesday.
