BSV is technically superior in every way with unbounded scaling limits, the lowest transactional fees (and continues to get cheaper as it scales) and highest transactional throughput capability that is thousands of times more than the top two ranked digital assets.
BTC is valued 38 times higher and ETH is valued 5 times higher based off market cap.
Ignoring any future price predictions, BSV has the goal to become the single global ledger of everything as there is no need for multiple public blockchains just like there is no need for multiple versions of the internet. This includes having the new value-based internet Metanet on-chain, controlling the new data economy with its unique value proposition of immutable data storage. This will open up a new world of earning potential and usability through microtransactions only possible due to its extremely low transactional fees by removing intermediaries and its aggressive push to keep scaling. It also has the capability of handling smart contracts , tokenization of real-world assets, identity management and of course remains the only true peer-to-peer cash system in the digital world.
BSV is either extremely undervalued, or its competitors are extremely overvalued.
The only way to know is to continue to focus on fundamental utility and ignore speculation. The free market will continue to self-regulate and the true value will be found over time.
BSV is the original Bitcoin protocol and is the only platform that massively scales and has open ended utility. Utility is the only way to create long term token value and that makes BSV also the only choice for real store of value. Proof of work and utility create store of value and nothing else and the markets have proven this in the last year.
