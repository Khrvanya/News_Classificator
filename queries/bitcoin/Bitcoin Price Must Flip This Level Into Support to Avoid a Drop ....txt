Bitcoin price continues to consolidate near a key support but a close above $9,400 is needed to avoid a sharper correction.
Over the weekend Bitcoin price ( BTC ) dropped below $9,000 for the second time in 7 days but the weekly close was relatively uneventful. As covered by Cointelegraph, buyers quickly stepped in to buy the dip at the $8,800 support on June 27 and at the time of writing the price is pushing toward $9,100.

While Bitcoin may make a run on the $9,200, the top-ranked digital asset on CoinMarketCap remains pinned below the 20-MA at $9,385 and a high volume node on the VPVR suggests the area will be a challenge to overcome in the short-term.
For the past week Bitcoinâ€™s momentum has waned as trading volume declined. Despite the sideways price action traders have consistently purchased recent dips below $9,000, and the uptrend remains intact as long as the price holds above $8,600.
One possible positive to note is over the weekend the 100-MA pulled above the 200-MA on the daily timeframe but ultimately risk averse traders will be better off waiting for a daily close above the 20-MA in the $9,400-$9,500 zone.
As Bitcoin price consolidates in what appears to be a tightening range, a number of altcoins capitalized on the sideways action by posting moderate gains. Chainlink ( LINK ) moved up by 3.58%, Compound added 4.36% ( COMP ), and DigiByte ( DGB ) rallied 10.63%.
