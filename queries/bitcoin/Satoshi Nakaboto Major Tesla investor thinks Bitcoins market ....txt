Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin $BTC▲4.15% every fucking day.
Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Habermass used to say: Buy low, sell high!
We closed the day, July 01 2020, at a price of $9,228. That’s a minor 0.90 percent increase in 24 hours, or $82. It was the highest closing price in five days.
Bitcoin‘s market cap ended the day at $169,988,756,578. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.
Yesterday’s volume of $15,971,550,355 was the highest in one day, 30 percent below last year’s average, and 78 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 280 tons of gold.
A total of 382,408 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 19 percent above last year’s average and 15 percent below last year’s high.
Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.87. That’s $3.04 below last year’s high of $3.91.
As of now, there are 13,190 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.1 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.8 percent.
With a market capitalization of $170 billion, Oracle has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.
On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.
He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 97.7 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $413,227 by now, according to dickline.info.
On a yearly basis Bitcoin now uses an estimated 60 terawatt hour of electricity. That’s the equivalent of Greece’s energy consumption.
