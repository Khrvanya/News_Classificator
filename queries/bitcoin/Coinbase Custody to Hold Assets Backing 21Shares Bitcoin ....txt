Crypto asset manager 21Shares will use Coinbase Custody to secure the Bitcoin backing its ETP launch on Thursday.
21Shares, an asset manager specialized in cryptocurrencies, has chosen the custody service offered by crypto exchange Coinbase for its Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded product.
According to a Wednesday Coinbase announcement, 21Shares will use Coinbase Custody to secure the Bitcoin backing the ETP launching Thursday. The derivative will launch on Deutsche Borse’s Xetra — Germany’s second-largest stock exchange.
The product is purportedly the first physically backed Bitcoin ETP in Europe.
As Cointelegraph reported , cryptocurrency exchange OKEx launched Ether ( ETH ) and EOS options in early June.
Still, the space recently saw its share of controversy when Qiao Wang —an investor, analyst and the head of product at a crypto market data firm — criticized how the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is set up. According to him, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s system could allow for it to trade at a discount compared to the net asset value of the fund’s assets.
