Bitcoin price broke the $10,000 barrier and rallied to $10,380 for the first time in 3 months.
Within the last hour, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price abruptly surged to $10,380 after spending the last month trading in a symmetrical triangle pattern. The move above the crucial $10K mark occurred as United States President Donald Trump mobilized local police and the National Guard to disperse masses of protestors on the White House grounds.
After a brief pullback to $10,100, bulls stepped in to provide renewed buying pressure. At the time of writing, the top-ranked cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has broken above the long-term descending trendline ($10,250), which has been in place since Bitcoin reached a $19,800 all-time high in 2018.
