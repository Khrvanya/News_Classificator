But the paper also points out that there’s still a lot of volatility. Crypto-related stocks dropped after the crypto bubble burst in 2018, and while Overstock.com and Hut 8 Mining have stabilized, they’re trending far from that former peak performance.
As far as their involvement in the crypto game, Overstock, for example, is an ecommerce retailer. It also runs a blockchain subsidiary called tZero, and plans to release its own currency by that name next year. Other players in cryptocurrency are well known names on stock tickers: Microsoft, Visa, PayPal, and Goldman Sachs are on Yahoo! Finance’s list of “top crypto bets.”
“Just because the company primarily focuses on crypto and blockchain doesn’t mean it can’t have other lines of business or even be in other segments of the crypto value chain to diversify the business risk of solely operating within a limited number of cryptocurrencies,” said Riley Adams, a CPA who blogs at Young and The Invested .
Basically, just as you want to diversify your investment portfolio to reduce the risk that one bad stock buy will wipe out your gains, businesses also want to reduce their risk by diversifying how they invest money within their own company. By focusing on the technology behind the specific currencies, Adams said, “it dramatically reduces the risk of any one currency going bust after heavily investing in it.”
Adams advised checking out companies who are working on payment facilitation or blockchain infrastructure, rather than those who are focusing on one specific type of cryptocurrency.
If you don’t want to keep track of individual stocks , you may still be able to get a piece this cryptocurrency development. Many of the companies on the Yahoo! list, for example, can be found within index funds based around company size or industry.
