I hold a JD/MBA and spent the formative years of my career in capital markets working across Mergers & Acquisitions, Derivative Products, Early-Stage Venture Capital, and Cryptocurrencies. I believe it is our duty to find solutions for the growing wealth divide and to create equality of opportunity for the next generation. You can tweet me @tatianakoffman .
