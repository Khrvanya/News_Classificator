The bitcoin price has climbed this year, partly due to interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies from ... [+] some of the world's biggest technology companies.
Bitcoin's sluggish adoption and lack of mainstream take up has been a common criticism of the technology in recent years.
Earlier this month, technology billionaire Mark Cuban warned bitcoin is "too difficult to use, too easy to hack, way too easy to lose, too hard to understand, [and] too hard to assess a value," adding bitcoin's biggest hurdle to overcome is getting people to actually use it .
"You don't have to convince me," Cuban said via Twitter . "You need to convince your neighbors. If they don't see value, that is the problem you need to solve. I'm not opposed to [bitcoin]. I understand every argument being made. The world is littered with great products [and] services that failed for lack of consumers."

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
