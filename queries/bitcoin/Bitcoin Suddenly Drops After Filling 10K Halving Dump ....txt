A return to five figures was fleeting as Bitcoin filled the largest CME futures gap ever, erasing last weekend’s 15% crash.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets and CoinMarketCap tracked BTC/USD as it rose to retake five figures on Thursday, gaining 13% in the past 24 hours.
Resistance levels in the $9,000 corridor quickly fell as momentum built to send Bitcoin back to its position from last week.
After reaching just below $10,000, a retracement took markets to press-time levels of $9,700 within minutes.
As Cointelegraph reported earlier, the moves are independent of other macro assets, indicating that Bitcoin is increasingly “decoupling” from external market influences.
For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe , Thursday’s upshoot was the result of Bitcoin filling a record “gap” in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures markets.

A regular event for BTC/USD, the price maneuvering to cover gaps between weekly trading sessions was the likely culprit for volatility on the day.
“Based on the 4h chart, the CME gap is filled. This caused a significant drop of $400, but also a nice trading range. Lows; $8,250-8,400 / $8,600 Highs; $9,800-10,100,” he summarized on Twitter .
No post-halving dump. The dump occurred before the halving. Bitcoin could be in a bull market.
