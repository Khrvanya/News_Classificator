Chamath Palihapitiya, the chief executive of Social Capital and Virgin Galactic chairman, has warned the Fed is creating a "deflationary cycle" by pumping trillions of dollars of cheap cash into the system.
"Now all of a sudden even [Paul Tudor Jones] is looking at bitcoin and the reason is because we are in this massive deflationary cycle," Palihapitiya told CNBC this week.

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
