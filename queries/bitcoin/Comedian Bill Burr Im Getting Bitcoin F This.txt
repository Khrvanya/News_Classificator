Comedian Bill Burr has seen the light after hearing Anthony Pompliano explain the disadvantages of legacy systems.
Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano has just persuaded Bill Burr, one of the biggest comedians in the world, to invest in cryptocurrency.
In a July 1 episode of the Bill Bert Podcast — so named for the comedian and his co-host Bert Kreischer — Burr said he was buying Bitcoin ( BTC ) after one of his famous profanity-laden tirades culminated in the phrase: “I’m getting Bitcoin! f--- this s---!”.
Pomp commented on Twitter after the interview: “I’m calling it now. On July 1, 2020, Bill Burr and Bert Kreischer kicked off a historic 18-month Bitcoin bull market.”
Pompliano, aka Pomp, had just finished educating the duo on how banks are unable to provide more than $250,000 in protection from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for some accounts.
Burr, who has a net worth of roughly $12 million, risks losing a lot of money should a bank fold, unless his fiat assets were highly spread out. The comedian took aim at “unqualified” bankers using his money to turn a profit, claiming they inflated the housing market.
“You create this whole f----ing bubble and when the whole thing goes to s--- you still get a f---ing bonus and you’re only gonna give me 250 off my million bucks? How is that f---ing legal? I’m getting Bitcoin! f--- this s---!”
The duo quizzed Pomp on almost everything financial, from legacy systems and inflation to the history of cryptocurrency back to Satoshi. Though not shying away from using financial lingo, Pomp kept his analogies simple, explaining distributed ledgers as a game of Monopoly in which everyone tracks the money.
Eventually the conversation turned practical, with the pair asking about the current price — $9,232 at the time of writing — and how crypto is held. Pomp even proposed Burr consider adding Bitcoin as an option for payments for his comedy shows, while Kreischer also expressed an interest in mining the cryptocurrency.
Responses from viewers were generally positive at the trio’s exchange.
“Pomp explains BTC to two wisecracking comedians so well that they’re genuinely fascinated,” said Twitter user Jeffcrow.
Redditor /u/Peter4real also credited the Bitcoin educator for explaining the concept to Burr: “He is being critical but trying to understand that there’s something rotten in the economy that affects everybody except the rich.”
However, being comedians, Burr and Bert took the time to make Pomp chuckle on a number of occasions with statements including “Bitcoin is like Cardi B: you’ve heard of her, but never heard of her songs.” Burr threw out the name of a person he invented at the Fed when challenged on his knowledge, which nearly caused Pomp to fall out of his chair laughing.

Upon seeing clips of the interview, members of Crypto Twitter were also quick to try their hand at a few jokes. User LowkeyKyrie said : “Bill, blink twice in the next clip if you are being held hostage until you push enough Bitcoin.”
