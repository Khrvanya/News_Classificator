The bitcoin price has rallied hard since its massive sell-off in March, with many bitcoin investors ... [+] confident the price will continue to rise until a scheduled supple squeeze in May.
Shortly before bitcoin's 20% rally this week , a large transfer of the stablecoin tether was made to bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis with its creators claiming they keep one U.S. dollar in reserve for every tether token issued.
Tether tokens worth a little over $50 million were transferred to Malta-based Binance early on Wednesday, just hours before bitcoin began its $30 billion pump.
A Twitter bot that records major bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades, called Whale Alert , picked up the transaction.
Over the past month Tether Ltd, which controls the stablecoin tether and shares owners and senior staff with the British Virgin Islands-based bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, has ramped up the number of tether it's creating—minting over $1 billion worth of the stablecoin.
"[On Wednesday we] witnessed extensive buying activity and the high level of scalability and liquidity evident on our platform made us able to seamlessly service all these requests," boasted Bitfinex chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino—who also serves as the chief technology officer of Tether—in a statement that pointed to major U.S. bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's unfortunate outage during the sudden bitcoin rally.
