IRS wants tracing tools for privacy coins, Bitcoin Lightning Network
The US agency puts out a call for prototypes to trace Monero, Zcash, OmiseGo, and other cryptocurrency tokens and platforms.
The IRS is on the hunt for new crypto tracing tools.
The request is focused on privacy-centric coins, as well as off-chain/side-chain protocols.
Interactive prototypes can be submitted until July 14.
A catch-all term for tokens used by networks as either a store of value, resources or information.
The agency issued a Request for Information earlier this week for the pilot program initiated by the IRS Criminal Investigations Division. The IRS is seeking an interactive prototype with a graphical interface that will let it cluster together transactions from a user, as well as associate “user distributed addresses with distributed ledger addresses” of criminal suspects. The news was first reported by industry publication The Block.
Additionally, the agency wants a prototype that can provide a library of suspects’ distributed ledger addresses, uses open-source intelligence data, and lets agents share data between investigations, as well as export data into various file formats.
The request specifically calls out the cryptocurrencies Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Dash (DASH), Grin (GRIN), Komodo (KMD), Verge (XVG), and Horizon (ZEN). In addition to Lightning, it also mentions Layer 2 protocol networks Raiden Network and Celer Network, as well as side-chains such as Plasma and OmiseGo (OMG).
The IRS admits that it doesn’t have a lot of options on those particular fronts.
