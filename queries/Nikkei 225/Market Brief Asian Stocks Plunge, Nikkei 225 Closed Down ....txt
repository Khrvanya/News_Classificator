Asian stocks plunged on Tuesday amid corporate outlook downgrades and fears that the coronavirus outbreak will drive the global economy in deep recession, as the costs of the coronavirus outbreak are only now becoming visible and we have probably not seen the worst yet. U.S., Spain and the U.K. reported new fatality highs, while in Italy the curve has flattened, as it reported a drop in death numbers for the second day.
China provides some signs of improvement as the Caixin Manufacturing PMI came in at 50.1, topping the expectations of 46 in March. Yesterday the Chinese manufacturing PMI showed a V-shaped rebound, from the record low of 35.7 to 52 in March.
