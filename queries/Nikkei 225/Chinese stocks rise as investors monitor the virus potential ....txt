Factories in China were scheduled to reopen on Monday after an extended holiday because of efforts to control the new coronavirus, though many are expected to remain shut for longer .
That could mean further disruptions to supply chains for many companies. Quarantines and other measures put in place to contain the outbreak could continue to disrupt electronics manufacturing well into the 2020 holiday season, even if factories quickly return to full production, manufacturing experts said.
"Hubei province, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, is one of China's major manufacturing hubs, specializing in steel, automobile, and electronics," analysts at Singapore's DBS Group Research wrote in a note.
"Most Asian economies import 20-30% of their intermediate goods from China," the analysts said. "This underscores a vulnerability to the supply chain if the pandemic causes production and shipment halts."
Shares of Taiwan-listed Hon Hai Precision Industry , better known as Foxconn and the world's largest iPhone assembler, were watched amid concerns its factories in China may not open on Monday as previously planned. That could potentially hit Apple and some analysts have already reduced their iPhone shipment predictions earlier this month.
On Monday, Reuters reported citing a person with direct knowledge that Foxconn received approval to resume production at a plant in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou. The source told Reuters that Foxconn executives were "trying very hard" to negotiate with authorities to continue production in other parts of the country.
While Foxconn did not outright confirm that its plans to restart operations have been delayed, it previously told CNBC in a statement: "The operation schedules for our facilities in China follow the recommendations of the local governments, and we have not received any requests from our customers on the need to resume production earlier."
Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry slipped 1.09% on Monday.
