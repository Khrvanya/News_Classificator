For traders News and features Analysis Nikkei 225 technical analysis: Time to look lower
Nikkei 30 analysis shows that the index is likely to turn south, as traders move away from stocks and into safe havens.
With the Japanese yen gaining strength the inverse relationship between the yen currency and the Nikkei 225 share should come into effect.
Nikkei 225 technical analysis shows that the index is still technically bullish, although last Friday’s sharp decline could be the catalyst for a much stronger downward move in the index.
Traders should be aware that the Japanese yen is vulnerable to further declines from a technical standpoint. This does not bode well for the Nikkei 225 over the medium-term.
Buyers recently failed to break above the index’s all-time high, around the 24,450 level. The reversal from the 24,100 level could weigh on the index from a technical perspective this week.
Ichimoku analysis on the daily time frame shows that upcoming support for the Nikkei 225 is located at the 23,350 level.
A loss of the 23,540 level will likely lead to a drop towards the index’s 50-day moving average, around the 23,330. Weakness under this area will largely depend on the geopolitical events this week.
With this in mind, traders should closely watch the 23,500 to 23,300 technical region for clues as to the scale of the potential decline.
A rebound from this area would be a short-term positive, while a loss of this area could be the catalyst for a drop under the 23,000 level, placing the 22,200 support area in focus.
Nikkei 225 technical analysis shows that the index is technically bullish over the short-term while trading above the 22,280 level.
The lower time frames show that a price gap on the charts was created last Friday, whether bulls can close the gap during early week trading remains to be seen.
Short-term traders may look to sell any short-term upside moves in the Nikkei 225 towards the price gap, in anticipation of further bearish geopolitical news this week.
The downside risk for the Nikkie 225 over the short-term would be a loss of the psychological 23,000 level, with the index’s 200-period moving average on the four-hour time frame, around the 22,200 level, the downside objective.
Technical support is extremely limited below the 23,000 level, and a bearish head and shoulders pattern would also form on the lower time frames if a drop towards the 23,000 level occurred.
Watch out for the possible creation of a bearish reversal pattern this week if selling pressure resumes.
Nikkei 225 analysis suggests that a bearish technical correction may take place towards the 23,500 to 23,000 levels.
Sustained weakness under the 23,00 level could quickly see the index declining to the 22,200 level.
