Tokyo stocks closed higher on Friday, extending rallies on Wall Street following a solid rebound in US employment, but investors remained cautious after a fresh surge in coronavirus cases in the Japanese capital.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.72 percent, or 160.52 points, to 22,306.48. It lost 0.91 percent over the week.
The broader Topix index was up 0.62 percent, or 9.57 points, to 1,552.33, but declined 1.59 percent from a week before.
"Japanese shares are being supported by rallies in US stocks" after better-than-expected jobs data in the world's biggest economy, said Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex.
The US economy regained 4.8 million jobs in June as businesses began to reopen nationwide, while the unemployment rate fell more than two points to 11.1 percent, the Labor Department reported.
Job numbers were far higher than economists were expecting in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and showed people returning to jobs in hard-hit sectors like leisure and hospitality, which accounted for just under half of the increase.
