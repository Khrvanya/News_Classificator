For traders News and features Analysis Japan 225: 22,955 critical support
The Nikkei 225 has been coming under heavy downside pressure over fears about the spread of the coronavirus in Asia.
Nikkei 225 technical analysis shows that a bearish breakout under the 22,955 level could provoke a 1,000 drop in the index.
Losses in the Nikkei 225 index have been accelerating over recent days due to growing fears about the spread of the coronavirus in Asia.
Nikkei 225 technical analysis is showing that the price is approaching critical technical support on the higher time frames.
Traders should note that a break under the 22,955 support level would invalidate a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern on the mentioned time frame.
According to the invalidation target of the bullish pattern the Nikkei 225 could decline by around 1,000 points if the 22,955 level is broken.
Another compelling piece of analysis is the current location of the Nikkei 225 index’s 200-day moving average.
The 200-day moving average is found around the 22,000 level, which coincides with the invalidation target of the invalidated head and shoulders pattern.
Watch out for selling pressure to intensify if the 22,955 level is broken over the coming days.
Nikkei 225 technical analysis shows that the index remains technically bullish over the short-term while trading above the 22,800 level.
The lower time frames shows a price gap on the charts has occurred over recent days, around the 23,770 level, due to Monday’s bearish price open.
Short-term bulls may choose to close the price gap on the charts, around the 23,770, before the next downturn in the index occurs.
An inverted head and shoulders pattern is also seen on the lower time frames, and is close to be invalidated as the price slump in the index continues.
Short-term traders will therefore be looking for two scenarios to occur over recent days. Either a sudden rally to close the price gap on the charts, or a continuation of the recent decline under the 23,000 level.
Fundamental factors surrounding the coronavirus and the upcoming FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) rate decision are likely to heavily influence the direction of the Nikkei 225.
Nikkei 225 analysis suggests that a strong decline towards the 22,000 level may take place if the 22,955 support level is broken.
