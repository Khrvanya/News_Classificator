Fauci did also say, however, that states with growing coronavirus outbreaks may not need to do an "absolute shutdown." More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus so far, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The moves regionally came as the coronavirus situation stateside continues to be watched, with White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warning Tuesday that parts of the U.S. are beginning to see a "disturbing surge" of Covid-19 cases .
In a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fauci said he is "quite concerned" about the rise in coronavirus cases in states that "reflect an increase in community spread." He did also say, however, that states with growing coronavirus outbreaks may not need to do an "absolute shutdown."
More than 2 million people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus so far, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
"COVID-19 case numbers continue to rise in the US, but for now markets are having trouble with the implications given the high bar to re-imposing restrictions," Tapas Strickland, director of economics at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said: "It is still unclear when the spread of COVID-19 will subside on a global basis, as the spread is continuing in emerging economies in particular. It seems inevitable that the negative impact on the global economy, including Japan, will become prolonged without effective vaccines and medicines."
"Due to expectations for the future, prices in financial markets have been high compared with the current severe situation of the real economy. It is necessary to closely monitor future developments in the markets to see whether there will be a correction in asset prices," the BoJ said.
