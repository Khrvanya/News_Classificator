Nikkei 225 & USD/JPY Price Outlook: Gains Contingent on Risk Appetite
The Nikkei 225 pulled back from the 20,000 area after an early run toward the level sputtered out. Still, recent price action has seen bulls make various attempts at overhead resistance with the move on April 7 establishing a new high above the March 25 peak around 19,650. With a fresh high on the chart, bulls may look to venture further in the days ahead should support around 19,040 and 18,220 hold if selling persists.
To be sure, an apparent slowdown in coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States has helped boost investor sentiment that should drive risk appetite. Similarly, a “do whatever it takes” mentality from the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan – among other major central banks – has renewed the confidence of many market participants. Together, fewer coronavirus cases and unprecedented central bank intervention will look to drive the Nikkei 225 higher in the days to come.
The same can be argued for USD / JPY . While extreme risk aversion and panic had bolstered the US Dollar ’s standing in early and mid-March, recent price action would suggest a return to normalcy for USD/JPY where the Greenback rallies in tandem with risk assets and the Yen rallies alongside “safer” investments like gold and US Treasuries.
