While Nicola Sturgeon may have dealt a blow when it came to beer gardens opening this week, this hasn't stopped the Corn Exchange getting ready for when the time finally comes.
As reported by Edinburgh Live, the Chesser venue announced it would be opening the city's "largest beer garden" - and now they've given revellers a sneak peek.
The venue's managing director Paul Demarco previously said that he was looking to adapt the venue to make it suitable for punters when lockdown begins to ease . And, by the looks of it, they have done exactly that.
In a series of clips, Paul revealed he was "gutted and disappointed" that they couldn't open the beer garden on Friday but said he thought he'd give people an idea "of what we had ready for you".
Taking viewers on a whistle-stop tour, he shows them the socially distanced bar, which has three serving points and floor markings that instruct people where to stand, while "sneeze guards" have also been installed to protect staff.
There are also a number of fun features, including ping pong tables, as well as roman columns and picket fences that were set to be used as props in the new beer garden.
"One thing we have here at the Corn Exchange is a lot of space", Paul explains before showing off three new socially distanced seating areas.
He added there will also be television in the beer garden showing sport and swingball and outdoor darts, while photos reveal there are props and a floral backdrop to make use of, too.
