• 1.5 teaspoons chili powder, blackening spice, or Cajun spice
• In a mixing bowl combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, and the zest from 2 limes and mix well.
• Place the corn directly on a hot grill for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes place it on indirect heat either off to the side or on the top section of the grill. Cook for 15-20 minutes with the lid of the BBQ closed.
• Pull back husk from the corn. Using a butter knife spread mayonnaise on all sides of the corn. Sprinkle all sides with cheese, cilantro, and chilli powder.
• Serve with lime wedges on the side to squeeze on if desired.
