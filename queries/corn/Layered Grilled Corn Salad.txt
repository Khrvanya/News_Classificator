Summer fresh corn on the cob is delicious but, it's even better when grilled and then served in a salad.

Prepare a medium heat grill. Remove corn from water. Grill corn with husks until tender, about 3-4 minutes on each side. Cool slightly. Remove husks and silks from corn. May need a brush to remove all of the silks.
Cut corn from cobs and transfer to a medium glass bowl. Stir in lime juice and zest, salt and pepper. Layer a third of each of the ingredients: corn, tomatoes, onion and basil. Repeat layers twice with remaining ingredients. Pour dressing over top; refrigerate at least 1 hour.
Add other ingredients such as sliced cucumbers, black beans, and/or bell peppers
Save time, cut ends off of corn and cook 3-4 minutes in microwave depending on the power of your Microwave. Check after 3 minutes to avoid overcooking.
