TABLE-China sees 2020/21 corn imports at 5 mln tonnes on rising trade with U.S.
BEIJING, May 12 (Reuters) - China expects corn imports in the 2020/21 crop year to rise by 25% to 5 million tonnes,
showed an agriculture ministry forecast on Tuesday, thanks to attractive import prices and as it implements the Phase 1
trade deal with the United States. 
    Soybean imports in the new crop year are expected to rise by almost 3% to 93.6 million tonnes, despite sluggish
demand because of the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to good crushing margins for soymeal producers and on lower imports of
    China, the world's top soybean buyer, brought in 24.51 million tonnes of the product in the first four months of the
    Planted acreage of soybean will rise 2.7% compared with last year, benefitting from government subsidies and surging
domestic prices, according to the release, while output will jump almost 4% to nearly 19 million tonnes. 
    Key numbers from the CASDE are below: 
     CASDE includes beginning and ending stocks for cotton, which Reuters assumes to include the cotton held by state
 reserves. Therefore, ending stocks cited in this table are the beginning stocks plus the latest yearâ€™s crop and imports,
 minus consumption and exports. For all other products, CASDE only includes the balance at the end of the crop year. This
                 appears to be the result of the crop output plus imports minus consumption and exports.
