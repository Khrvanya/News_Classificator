SLEEPY EYE — The Sleepy Eye Chamber of Commerce recently announced it is evaluating all options to find alternative ways to celebrate the tradition of Buttered Corn Days for the 60th year on Friday and Saturday, Aug. 21 & 22.
“Yes, corn will be involved,” read a Sleepy Eye Area Chamber Board of Directors announcement. “After much deliberation and responsible consideration, the Sleepy Eye Chamber of Commerce strongly feels it remains important to celebrate our community and the rich history Buttered Corn Days has always brought with it,” read the news release.
“Our traditional ways of celebrating including park activities, a street dance, rib cook-off and our always popular grand parade will not be happening this year,” continued the release. “Given the unknowns of the COVID-19 situation, we feel it prudent and responsible to not hold this event in the manner which we are all used to.”
The release added that the safety of vendors, volunteers and guests are always the first priority for Buttered Corn Days.
“It is also vital that we protect the integrity of our events and the financial well-being of the Sleepy Eye Chamber of Commerce,” read the announcement. “Please know this decision was not made lightly. We recognize the importance of our celebration weekend holds for non-profits in our community and the impact it has on local businesses, sponsors, celebration vendors and partners.”
