Apparently, it’s not too late to buy Zoom Video Communications shares.
Late yesterday, Needham analyst Richard Valera picked up coverage of the company’s shares with a Buy rating and a $140 price target. Zoom (ticker: ZM) has been one of the few bullish stories amid the coronavirus crisis, with the stock up 59% for the year through Monday’s close. Valera thinks the run has further to go.
“We think Zoom’s exceptionally easy to use meetings product has both enabled and benefited from a long-term secular shift towards working from home,” he writes in a research note. “We think Covid-19 is driving an enduring acceleration of this shift. In the near-term, our checks confirm significant increases in business activity, especially in Covid hotspots, which admittedly could be mitigated by delays in closing larger enterprise deals.”
He also writes that the company’s Phone business—a cloud-based enterprise telephone service—should see “an inflection” in fiscal 2021.
“Net, we think Zoom will see upside results throughout the Covid-driven downturn, while being a meaningful beneficiary longer term,” he writes.
While Valera concedes that the stock isn’t cheap at 25 times his fiscal 2021 sales estimate of $1.22 billion, he argues that the company can sustain a 40% compounded five-year growth rate.
Zoom shares lately seem to move inversely with the market’s mood, rallying on down days and settling back when investors find other things to buy. In recent trading, with the S&P 500 up 3.2%, Zoom is off 1.1%, at $106.77.
