Dietitian Kim Galeaz is sharing a few tips about shopping, cooking and eating during this unprecedented time of stress, anxiety and uncertainty. She suggests THREE KEY INGREDIENTS to help your family stay happy, healthy and enjoying food/meals during this time.
1. Number One Ingredient in your Meals/Meal Planning/Shopping is FLEXIBILITY.
1 pound extra lean ground beef (90% lean, 10% fat) (or sub ground turkey, chicken, pork, chorizo, soy crumbles or whatever protein you have or like!)
1 very large garlic clove, very finely minced (or onion powder)
1 can (14.5 oz.) petite diced tomatoes, drained
1 can (15.25 oz.) sweet corn kernels, drained
1 can (7 oz.) diced green chile peppers, drained
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook ground beef, onions and garlic until beef is browned and onions soft. Add beans, diced tomatoes, corn, green chilies, cumin, chili powder, crushed red pepper and hot pepper sauce. Cook until everything is thoroughly hot. Serve in taco shells, corn or flour tortilla shells, or with corn tortilla chips as nachos. Makes around 8 to 9 cups Fiesta Filling.
