West Point community members voted Monday night to cancel the city's sweet corn festival, citing social distancing and sanitization concerns.
City officials said while it was an tough decision but they're confident they made the right one.
"It's always a great fear when you have a pandemic like this and you've got a massive amount of people that are involved in either the festival or even such as the state fair that got cancelled last week," city manager Dennis McGregor said.
But it's not just the fun, chicken dinners, corn shucking and carnival rides residents are going to miss this year.
Bringing in anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people each year, the festival also functions as the city's biggest fundraiser.
"The Sweetcorn Festival brings in about $80,000 to $90,000 and that is before all bills are paid and stuff," Community Club president Katie Wilson said.
Even after costs, there's plenty of money flowing into the community.
"It's usually typically anywhere from 18 to 25 thousand dollars that goes back into the community," McGregor said.
Community members say that money goes to work all across the city.
"We did $50,000 to the new school, we've done upgrades in town, we did the South park concession stand and they've done this beautiful shelter house over here," Wilson said.
Officials said now they're focusing on the future.
"West Point is strong and they will be stronger than ever next year. Look forward to a fantastic Sweet Corn Festival next year," he said.
