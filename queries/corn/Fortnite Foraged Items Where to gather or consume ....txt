There's been a huge shake up to the way Fortnite foraged items work now, as in addition to consuming them for a health or shield boost, for the first time you can now gather and store these fruits and vegetables in your inventory for later use. Individually they don't provide a huge benefit, but now you can carry them in stacks of up to 15 items each they can be as effective as other Fortnite healing items such as bandages. As well as finding them on their own, you can also search Noms boxes which drop a handful of consumable food items, so there's more ways to eat than ever before. If you need them to complete one of the Fortnite challenges , or you just want to bolster your health and shield, follow our guide and we'll show you exactly where to go to find Fortnite foraged items.
