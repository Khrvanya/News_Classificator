KIEV, UKRAINE — Ukraine has decided not to limit corn exports for the remainder of the marketing year, which ends June 30, APK-Inform, an agriculture consultancy, said on April 27 without citing sources.
Ukraine’s economy minister said last week that the country was considering limiting exports for this season despite a record harvest and an expected decrease in prices and demand.
APK-Inform said the decision not to limit corn exports was made at an April 27 meeting between the agricultural ministry and agriculture unions.
Ukraine, Russia and several other major grain producers have been considering halting exports due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which has infected more than 3 million people worldwide while killing more than 212,000.
Ukraine, perennially among the world’s biggest grain exporters, has exported 25.2 million tonnes of corn in 2019-20, 2.7 million tonnes more than the previous season.
