Sure, you can buy corn year-round, but the yellow imposters found in the dead of winter are completely flavorless. We recommend taking full advantage of the late-summer bounty by turning it into stock, which you can freeze and savor for as long as humanly possible. This stock is great for to use as a base for soup and chowder , thinning out sauces and for adding flavor to rice by cooking it in the broth.
We purée corn kernels and throw them into our stock to pack in even more corn flavor. Spices such as toasted black peppercorns and coriander seeds add complexity, but the most flavorful component in this stock is the charred yellow onion. We’re talking about a deep, beautifully blackened char that fills up your kitchen with that bittersweet caramelized onion scent.
Aside from what you put into your corn stock, it is also important how you make your stock.  Don’t rush it; go low and slow. Once the stock is at a rolling boil, lower to a gentle simmer and watch it slowly and gracefully turn into something magical.
