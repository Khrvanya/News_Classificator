Cardwell said feed and residual use was increased by 150 million bushels, but corn ending stocks were still raised.
Corn ending stocks are 200 million bushels higher than last month at 2.09 billion bushels. The average trade guess had corn ending stocks pegged at 2 billion. This month’s projection for corn ending stocks is lower than 2018/2019’s estimate of 2.22 billion bushels.
Officials raised soybean ending stock projections from 425 million bushels to 480 million bushels; the average trade guess for soybeans was 430 million bushels.
USDA raised wheat ending stocks from 940 million bushels last month to 970 million this month. The number is still lower than last year’s estimate of 1.09 billion bushels. The 2019/20 outlook for wheat is lower for exports and reduced domestic use. Traders had wheat ending stocks 940 million.
Moving forward, traders will have their eyes in the field as U.S. farmers begin corn and soybean planting in the weeks ahead.
