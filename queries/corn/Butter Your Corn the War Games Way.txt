I have a summer tradition that involves yelling about raw corn on the internet . Raw corn is good and I think more people should eat it, so every summer I just start shouting and resharing this little blog I wrote a few years ago. This inevitably leads to a lot of corn discourse, and this year that included someone sending me this clip from War Games (1983), a fine film I saw once as a child on VHS.
The funny (and pertinent) part is when the dad yells “This corn is raw!,” but I was too distracted by the ingenious way he applies butter to his corn. He takes a piece of soft white bread (a common bread at my childhood supper table), slathers it with butter (it actually is probably margarine), then wraps it around an ear of corn and twirls the corn to coat it completely.
Now, I have been eating corn in many forms for a few decades now. I have never seen this particular butter methodology, and I am delighted by it. But my managing editor Joel tells me it is possibly quite common in the midwest; at least, his dad and maternal grandmother have always buttered corn this way. I must say I approve. Not only is the corn completely buttered, but your hand is kept clean and you have a piece of soft buttered bread to mop your plate with. It’s a perfect little system.
