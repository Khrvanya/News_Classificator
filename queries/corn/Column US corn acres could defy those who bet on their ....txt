FORT COLLINS, Colo. (Reuters) - Many market analysts believe that actual corn plantings in the United States will be notably lower than the stunningly high number that farmers reported to the government last month, though history suggests that bets for a large drop in plantings are not the safest.

However, new-crop Chicago corn futures, a gauge of potential profitability, have fallen to extremely low levels and this could cause farmers to ditch corn more than they have in the past. But it could also cause them to stick with their original plan depending on their insurance situation.
Based on a survey of about 80,000 producers conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture between Feb. 28 and March 18, farmers intend to plant some 97 million acres of corn in 2020, up 8% on the year. USDA published that number on Tuesday and it would be the largest area since 2012, which had been a 76-year high.
The trade expected corn acres at 94.3 million before Tuesday’s report, though some thought plantings would come in artificially high because corn prices were relatively more favorable at the time of the survey than they are now. Corn intentions topped the pre-report trade range of predictions, the fourth such instance in the last decade.
The lowball miss of 2.7% was not as bad as in 2016, when analysts’ average guess on March corn intentions was 3.9% too low. There are some other good comparisons with 2016 that can inform on 2020 possibilities, but spoiler alert: final acres in 2016 were higher than what farmers reported in March.
Last year, U.S. corn plantings fell 3.3% from March intentions to the final figure, impressive considering the record-late planting and record-high prevented acres. That was easily explainable by the June rally in corn futures to five-year highs, while soybean prices remained relatively low.
But aside from last year, the last time corn acres fell by more than 2% from March to final was in 1997, and the actual loss was less than 2 million acres.
In the last 30 years, corn plantings fell more than 3 million acres from March to final only three times: 1993, 1995 and 2019. Extreme weather caused historic planting delays in all three of those years, and the largest fall was in 1995 of 3.8 million acres or 5%.
Extreme weather is not expected for 2020, but still, applying the worst-case 1995 scenario to 2020 would yield between 92 million and 93.1 million acres.
For reference, and assuming normal harvesting losses, this year’s crop could tie 2016’s record output of 15.148 billion bushels with a planted area of 92.6 million acres and a yield of 178 bushels per acre. USDA is currently using a long-term trend yield of 178.5 bpa for 2020.
The ratio of new-crop CBOT futures, November soybeans to December corn, can often dictate how much corn farmers may plant relative to soybeans. Values around 2.3 or lower favor corn while those above 2.4, and certainly closer to 2.5, support soybeans.
That ratio averaged 2.36 during USDA’s planting survey period, with a high of 2.41 on March 2 and a low of 2.3 on March 16. However, it has averaged 2.41 in the days after the survey, finishing at 2.49 on Wednesday, its highest since 2018.
The new-crop futures ratio followed a similar pattern in late March and early April 2016, largely the result of the huge corn acreage surprise. The trade once again got stung by high corn acres in the June 2016 acreage report because analysts falsely believed the drastic shift in the ratio toward beans would cause farmers to switch out corn acres.
But perhaps they ignored the favorable spring planting weather, which can make a big difference. By mid-May 2016, some 75% of the crop had been planted, above the previous five-year average of 70%. For comparison, mid-May corn progress in 1993, 1995 and 2019 was around 38%.
As with 2020 futures, December 2016 corn futures began April at the lowest levels since 2006, but futures started to rally mid-month on dryness in Brazil. Corn continued to rally in May 2016, peaking around $4.50 per bushel in mid-June as Brazil’s dryness had become a full-blown drought.
December corn finished at $3.47-1/4 per bushel on Wednesday, more than 20 cents below that of April 1, 2016, which had marked that year’s contract low, at least until harvest.
Low corn prices and the soybean-favoring ratio might suggest some switching of corn acres, but November soybeans are not doing well either, settling at $8.63-1/2 per bushel on Wednesday. That is their lowest open to April since 2007.
New-crop soybeans also spent a lot of time at multi-year lows in early 2016, but they started to rally in March on excessive rains in Argentina, finally topping out around $11.60 in June.
Farmers do not usually fall back on their insurance plans this early in the season, but given the dreadfully low prices, the February insurance guarantees may keep farmers with Revenue Protection from switching out of corn.
Revenue Protection from USDA’s Risk Management Agency protects farmers from low prices and the potential payout largely has to do with the projected price, which is the average of new-crop futures in February. This year, the corn average was $3.88 per bushel, the lowest since and close to 2016’s $3.86.
Farmers always hope for a summer rally to provide marketing opportunities. But if they feel the rally prospects are unusually bleak this year, Revenue Protection may be the best option depending on their assumptions.
Potential payments also depend on what level of coverage the producer has selected, as well as on his or her individual production history. The actual 2020 harvest result and harvest prices will be factors, too. But depending on how prices trend over the next several weeks, Revenue Protection could cause U.S. farmers to retain more corn acres than many analysts expect.
Another possible reason that farmers hung on to corn acres in 2016 instead of switching to beans could be the very low insurance guarantee for soybeans that year of $8.85 per bushel.
This year’s bean guarantee is the lowest since 2016, but notably higher at $9.17. Relative to the corn guarantee, it favors beans a little more this year than it did in 2016, but again, it all depends on the individual farmer’s situation and whether the insurance money might pencil out in the end.
