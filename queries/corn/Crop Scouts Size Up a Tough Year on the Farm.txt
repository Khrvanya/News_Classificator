HENRY COUNTY, Ind.—Greg Blanton entered a field of underdeveloped corn through an empty patch, a result of the record-wet weather this year that kept many farmers from planting. He picked a few small ears and said they looked similar to the corn growing on his own 4,500 acres across five counties in Ohio.
“It’s got a lot of growing to do,” Mr. Blanton said to companions on an annual tour to survey the size and condition of corn and soybeans across the Farm Belt. “There’s going to be a lot of damage that’s not going away.”
