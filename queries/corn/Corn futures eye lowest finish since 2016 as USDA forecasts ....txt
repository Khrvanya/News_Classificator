Corn futures may settle Tuesday at their lowest since 2016 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated U.S. corn planted area for 2020 at 97 million acres, up 8% from last year. The market was looking for smaller planted acreage, with average estimates at 94.328 million acres, according to Daniels Trading. A separate USDA report revealed that total U.S. corn stocks stood at 7.95 billion bushels on March 1, down 8% from the same date a year earlier. The corn stocks figure was lower than an average estimate of 8.125 billion bushels, according to Daniels Trading. The most-active May corn contract ck20 extended earlier losses, trading down 6 3/4 cents, or 2%, to $3.34 1/2 a bushel in Chicago. A settlement below $3.35 would be the lowest since September 2016, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
