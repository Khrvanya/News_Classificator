CHICAGO — There were no shockers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s supply and demand and crop production reports released June 11.
Highlights of the USDA old crop and new crop projections were analyzed by Rich Nelson, Allendale Inc. chief strategist, on the company’s website. He noted the changes USDA made on the balance sheets.
“USDA raised 2019-2020 ending stocks from 2.09 billion bushels last month to 2.103 billion bushels. The trade was expecting 2.150 billion. So, it was a smaller than expected increase for corn old crop stocks.
“USDA lowered the 2019 harvest number from 13.663 billion bushels to 13.617 billion bushels. So, we had a 46 million bushel decline in last year’s harvested crop. We did expect a moderate decline, but maybe this was a little larger than the trade expected to see.
“This more or less offset a negative movement of a 50 million bushel drop in corn for ethanol. So, USDA did address the corn for ethanol issue, but that was almost completely offset by the 2019 production revision.”
“Ending stocks for 2020-2021 went from 3.318 billion bushels last month to now 3.323 billion bushels. There are no changes on the new crop balance sheet. The changes were simply made by carrying over the old crop information.”
“It was the same type of story for domestic soybeans. We did have a minor revision in the 2019 crop with a 5 million bushel decline to now 3.552 billion bushels. USDA increased domestic crush by 15 million bushels. That’s good.
“USDA dropped exports by 25 million bushels. That was not a big surprise, but we’ll probably argue with some of that movement in the grand scheme of things. The ending stocks were changed and it’s now 585 million bushels for old crop.”
“USDA raised domestic crush on new crop soybeans by about 15 million bushels and despite the fact that we are still behind on the pace we’d like to see for new crop soybean exports, USDA did not touch those numbers. Therefore, new crop stocks were lowered from 405 million to now 395 million bushels.”
“USDA made a minor change to the old crop balance sheet. The old crop marketing year ended on May 31. We saw a 5 million bushel decline on exports and therefore 2019-2020 ending stocks were changed to 983 million bushels.”
“On the wheat production side, the trade was expecting a decline in wheat production. However, all wheat production was raised by 11 million bushels on this report to 1.877 billion. So, new crop wheat stocks were raised from 909 million bushels to 925 million bushels.”
“The numbers on wheat are increasing and now over 316 million tons and that is a little negative. It simply added to what is going to be a record burdensome supply for the world wheat situation.
“The Australian wheat crop was raised 2 million tons to now 26 million tons. The Russian wheat crop was unchanged at 77 million tons.”
“Argentina’s crop was left unchanged at 50 million tons and the new crop 2021 harvest was also left unchanged at 50 million tons. The Brazil corn was 101 million tons for old crop, that was unchanged, and USDA raised the Brazil new crop by 1 million to 107 million tons. So, a new record Brazilian crop waiting for us in the spring of 2021.”
“We did see minor changes. Argentina soybeans were lowered to 50 million tons and Brazilian soybeans unchanged at 124 million tons.”
