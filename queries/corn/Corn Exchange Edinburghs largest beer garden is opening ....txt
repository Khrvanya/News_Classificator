Its been a long, dry three months but following Nicola Sturgeon’s recent announcement , you could soon be sitting down to an ice-cold beer in Edinburgh’s largest new beer garden.
The Corn Exchange announced they were to be transformed into capital's 'largest beer garden' post-lockdown back in June, but they have only now been able to start taking bookings.
Organisers showed off a number of fun features, including ping pong tables, roman columns and picket fences in a behind the scenes video on Monday (June 21).
There will also be television in the beer garden showing sport and swingball and outdoor darts, while photos reveal there are props and a floral backdrop to make use of, too.
In an announcement yesterday organisers said: “Come rain or shine, we are offering a safe, healthy outdoor environment to enjoy a few drinks with your pals. Our internal experts have carefully curated the finest "socially-distanced" beer garden in Edinburgh.”
Unlike in the olden days you can’t just rock up. New government rules mean you’ll need to reserve a spot and provide details for everyone who is coming.
On arrival social distancing measures will direct you to enter via a one-way system, pints will be served by staff with access to full PPE and only cashless payments will be accepted at the bar.
