Corn on the cob is a delicious side dish to have at any barbecue , whether you’re cooking up a vegetarian BBQ feast or just looking to add some grilled vegetables to your spread of grilled meats.
Cooking a corn on the cob on the barbecue can be easier said than done and if executed poorly you’re doing to end up with a dry (or worse case scenario, burnt!) side.
However, with a little expert advice, barbecuing a corn on the cob is relatively simple and straight forward.
Mark Hartstone, award-winning chef proprietor at La Fosse at Cranborne , told Metro.co.uk that ‘Corn on the cob is always a winner’ and shared two ways to cook corn on the cob – depending on whether you get the peeled or ‘rustic’ unpeeled version.
If you buy your corn from a farmer’s market, local store or organic shop you may find that it is unpeeled and still has its green leafy outer casing. If this is the case – great! Don’t peel it and cook the corn on the cob ‘rustic-style’ like Mark explains here:
‘ To cook in a rustic manner, leave the skin on and cook on the grill till the outer leaves are well and truly charred. The inside will be juicy with a hint of smoke. Finished with a good dollop of butter and Dorset Chilli Sea Salt for a slight kick.’
For corn that you’ve peeled or corn on the cob bought from a supermarket, Mark advises quickly popping them in a pan of water first: ‘Blanch the peeled corns in boiling unsalted water for 1 minute, then refresh afterwards in cold water.’

Before cooking them on the barbecue by putting them straight on the grill: ‘Put neatly in a rack and quickly grill before you eat.’
