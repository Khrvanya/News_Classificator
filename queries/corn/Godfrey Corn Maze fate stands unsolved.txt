GODFREY — While the corn has been planted, the fate of this year’s Great Godfrey Maze is still very much undecided.
Godfrey Mayor Mike McCormick said a decision is expected by mid-June on whether the village will proceed with the attraction. The maze, which normally runs from September through October, brings large numbers of visitors to Glazebrook Park.
Like many other activities, plans for the maze are being severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’re looking at a couple of different routes,” McCormick said.
One is to have a shortened version of the maze, possibly only the “Haunted Maze” later in the season in October.
“If there’s any way possible, we’ll have the full-blown thing,” he said. “It’s part of Godfrey. Our goal is to get it done, but at this time because of restrictions we’re not sure if we can do it.”
The field is usually planted several weeks after most of the area’s corn goes into the ground so it remains green a little longer into the season. The maze design, normally announced at the village’s Independence Day celebration, is sprayed into the corn sometime before July 4.
This year’s design, “The Greatest Show in Godfrey,” has a circus theme. A rough outline was released by the village Friday.
Both the July 4th celebration and the Corn Festival, held in conjunction with the maze, have been cancelled.
McCormick said the village is still trying to determine if the village can have fireworks, possibly by having visitors stay in their cars. He said village officials are talking with the fireworks company and a final decision will be made at the June 15 Godfrey Village Board meeting.
