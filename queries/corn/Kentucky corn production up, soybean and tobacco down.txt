LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) released the Crop Production 2019 Summary today, showing an increase in corn production and a decrease in soybean and tobacco production.
“Too much rain early in the season, and then drought later in the season, kept the 2019 crops from reaching their full potential,” said David Knopf, director of the NASS Eastern Mountain Regional Office in Kentucky. “Yields for corn and soybeans were below 2018 levels. Tobacco yielded much better than the 2018 crop, which was damaged by excessive moisture.”
Corn production in Kentucky is estimated at 245 million bushels, up 15% from the 2018 crop. Yield was estimated at 169 bushels per acre, down 6 bushels from last year. The lower yield was offset by a 19% increase in acres harvested as grain, estimated at 1.45 million acres. The U.S. corn production is estimated at 13.7 billion bushels, up slightly from the November forecast and down 5% from the revised 2018 estimate.
