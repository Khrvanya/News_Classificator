New Delhi — Corn prices in the US saw an unprecedented decline during March and April, following demand destruction in the ethanol industry after the US went under lockdown in order to contain spread of COVID-19.
The move curtailed demand for ethanol at a time when prices of the grain-based fuel were already weighed down by a historic drop in gasoline prices. Ethanol is used in the US as an automobile fuel blended with gasoline.
Concerns of lower feed demand for corn also emerged after closure of meat plants in the US due to the coronavirus. Additionally, expectations of a record crop weighed further on corn prices in the country. Corn futures prices fell to a three-and-a-half-year low of $3.01/bu in mid-April.
The US government recently eased stay-at-home orders in most states, and a few states are either following a phased-in approach, or extending the lockdown.
With the easing of lockdown measures, consumption of ethanol in the US rose, igniting hopes for a recovery in US corn demand as nearly 40% of corn produced in the US goes into ethanol production.
The US Energy Information Administration increased its forecast for 2020 ethanol production to an average of 870,000 b/d this year, up from its April forecast of 820,000 b/d in its short-term energy outlook report released May 12.
According to the same EIA report, fuel ethanol production in the US in 2019 averaged 1.03 million b/d.
--Corn futures contract prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, which had dropped dangerously close to a nine-year low of $3/bu in April, have recovered recently. Over the period of April 28-May 14, the CBOT May corn futures contract gained 17.5 cents, or nearly 6%, to $3.2025/bu.
--The CIF New Orleans barge corn premiums for May shipment closed at 49 cents/bu over the CBOT July (N) corn futures contract on Thursday, up 4 cents since April 28, according to S&P Global Platts assessment.
--The higher basis and higher CBOT corn futures contract led to a near 6% rise in the outright price for May shipment to $3.6650/bu over the April 28-May 14 period.
--Ethanol prices in the US also started to strengthen towards the end of April as lockdown restrictions eased. Platts assessed prices of Chicago Argo ethanol at $1.1065/gal on Thursday, nearly 25% higher than 88.6 cents/gal assessed on April 21.
--Increased mobility is expected to support ethanol consumption in the US. Over the last few weeks, five US states have seen mobility patterns increase by at least 20 percentage points, while an 13 states saw an increase of 15-20 points, a report by University of Washington said on Tuesday.
--Ethanol production in the US for the week ended May 8 was up 15% at 617,000 b/d from an all-time low of 537,000 b/d for week ending April 24, EIA data showed.
--Ending stocks of ethanol in the US saw a decline after April 24, suggesting higher consumption of ethanol in the country. Weekly ending stocks of fuel ethanol in the US for the week ended May 8 were reported at 24.19 million barrels, down from 27.69 million barrels for the week ended April 17, according to the EIA data.
--Demand for feed is also likely to rebound in the US, after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on April 28 asking slaughterhouses to remain open. Around 14 meatpacking facilities, including Tyson and Smithfield, resumed operations in the country, the US Department of Agriculture said last week.
--Meat production in the US was up 10.7% week on week at 752.2 million lbs for the week ended May 9, according to USDA data.
--Additional support to US corn prices is coming from concerns of possible freeze damage to corn already showing in the US Corn Belt. According to weather agency Maxar, very cold conditions with hard freeze were noted in parts of the US last week, which are likely to have caused minor damage to emerging corn.
--The USDA in its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report on Tuesday showed an increase in the expected volume of US corn exports for the current marketing year to 1.775 billion bushels from 1.725 billion bushels projected earlier in April. For the next marketing year, starting September 2020, the USDA expects corn exports to rise by 375 million bushels year on year to 2.15 billion bushels.
--Demand for US corn from China is likely to be firm in the coming days, according to sources. The US has sold 686,000 mt of US corn to Chinese destinations, the USDA said on May 7. Of the total sales to China, 371,000 mt was for delivery during the 2019-20 marketing year and 315,000 mt for delivery during 2020-21. However, there have been some concerns of demand loss from China, stemming from deteriorating diplomatic relations between the two countries.
--As of May 7, the USDA reported net sales of 1.07 million mt of corn for 2019-20, up 39% from the previous week and 14% above the previous four-week average. The increase in exports primarily came from China, Mexico, Japan and Columbia, the USDA said in its weekly export sales report on Thursday.
