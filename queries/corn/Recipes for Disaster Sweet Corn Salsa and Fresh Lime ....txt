Mix ingredients and set aside.
-Mix marinade ingredients well and add to corn mixture.
-Refrigerate for several hours. I find that if you leave it set overnight, the flavors have time to marry together.
-Drain excess marinade before serving. (This is optional. I actually like the extra marinade).
FYI: This recipe can be double. The marinade should cover a double recipe.
-Salt for the rim of the glass.
-First salt the rim of the glass. That’s easy to do by placing two small plates or saucers side by side. One has water on it and the the other salt. Dip the glass in the water and then dip/rib the rim of the glass in the salt.
-Put ice cubes in the glass.
-Pour over all the ingredients in the glass.
-Give it a quick stir.
A Personal Note: I feel that every recipe has a story behind it and how it got started. That got me thinking about this week’s recipe because literally all I have is the ingredients and directions printed on a piece of Christmas stationary that I usually have stuffed away in my “everything” drawer in my kitchen. (I’m sure you have one of those drawers too. Growing up my parents called it the ‘junk drawer.’ There was a little bit of everything in there).
Thinking back, I remembered where it came from. About 10 years ago, in what seems like a lifetime ago, I lived in New Hampshire and during a gathering I tried this salsa that my neighbor had made. I must have been around Christmas because of the stationary. I loved it so much that I later asked for the recipe. Now I’m passing it onto you.
A reminder: Got a recipe? I would love to hear from you. You can send your suggestions to mbarclay@goodkarmabrands.com. We’ll give it a taste and post the recipe online for others to check out.
