Crookham Co., Caldwell, Idaho, is introducing a purple and white sweet corn variety, Wild Violet, this spring.
The bi-color corn, bred with traditional non-GMO practices, has an average of 60% purple kernels per cob, according to a news release. The company has worked over 10 years on the variety.
Primary suppliers of the Wild Violet variety are Branch: A Family of Farms, Five Crowns Marketing, and Charlie's Produce.
“Wild Violet has a wonderful eating quality with higher antioxidants when compared to other sweet corn varieties,” George Crookham, CEO, said in the release. “We are confident that Wild Violet will bring innovation to the sweet corn category for retailers.”
The variety retains its vibrant pigments even after cooking, and longer cooking times deepen the purple to violet and indigo, according to the release.
The variety will be available in the spring.
