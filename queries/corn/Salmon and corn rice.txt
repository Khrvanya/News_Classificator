A one-pot rice dish that both kids and adults will love? Yes, please! You can easily increase the quantities of this if you wish (see tip below), or add some frozen peas as well.
Place the rice into a small dutch oven and cover with water. Stir the rice with your hand, then pour as much of the water away as you can without tipping the rice out of the pot. Repeat 3 times, then top up with water so that the level is about 2 centimetres above the top of the rice. Stir the salt, sake and fish sauce (or soy sauce) through the rice. Cut the salmon into thirds lengthways.
Over medium-high heat, bring the pot to the boil, then continue to boil for around 5 minutes until the water level reaches the top of the rice (the rice will expand).
Place the salmon fillet on top of the rice and scatter over the corn. Reduce the heat to very low, cover the pot with a lid and cook for 12 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pot to stand for a further 5 minutes without removing the lid.
You can either serve the rice straight from the pot or gently stir the contents together with a spatula so that the salmon breaks up.
Adam's tip: If you're increasing the quantities of salmon in the salmon and corn rice dish, use a little less water. The salmon will release liquid, and too much will make your rice soggy.
