Back in the camp, she then strolled over to Ian where she deposited the goods next to a sleepy Ian in his hammock.
The former footballer, 56, appeared delighted at the treat and was soon happily munching away discreetly.
Speaking later in the bush telegraph, Caitlyn pleaded her innocence, she said: 'Did any leftovers make it back into the camp? Maybe, maybe not. I’m pleading the fifth!'
While Ian later joked: 'I don’t think anybody has any photographic evidence of misdemeanors in the food department. I defy you to find any.'
Caitlyn's act of kindness didn't go amiss by fans, with many praising her for breaking the rules to smuggle in the corn.

'Caitlyn giving Ian a corn of the cob has to be the best thing I have ever seen,' said a fourth delighted viewer.
'Forget the rules! @Caitlyn_Jennerbringing @IanWright0 corn on the cob from the roast she had, was seriously sweet! Ian has been doing a lot of trials these few days and being arguably most hungry, Caitlyn giving him something from the roast was so generously nice' wrote a fifth.
With another Caitlyn fan adding: 'OK @Caitlyn_Jenner risking breaking camp rules to makes sure Ian got something nice to eat, has 100% put me on #TeamCaitlyn #CaitlynJenner to win!'
