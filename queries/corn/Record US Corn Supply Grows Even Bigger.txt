Economic pause due to the pandemic has slowed demand for corn as U.S. farmers plant a robust crop
A strong planting season for U.S. corn is expected to lead to a record-high supply, as demand for the crop remains muted thanks to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Ending stocks of corn—unsold corn left over after the marketing year is done—are expected to total 3.32 billion bushels in 2020-21, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in its monthly supply and demand estimate report Thursday. That figure is 58% higher than last year’s ending stocks, according to USDA data.
