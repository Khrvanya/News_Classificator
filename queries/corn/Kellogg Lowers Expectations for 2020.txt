Cereal and snack maker is investing in promising brands to boost sales; shares fall
Kellogg Co. provided a sober outlook for profit and sales this year, as the food maker invests more in snacks and works to rejuvenate struggling cereal brands.
The company on Thursday forecast a 1% to 2% increase in comparable sales for 2020, short of analyst expectations, and said its earnings per share could fall as much as 4% this year. Kellogg said the sale of its Keebler cookies and other brands to Ferrero Group last July continues to weigh on profit more than analysts realized.
