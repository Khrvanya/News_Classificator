She continued that she swapped her Cheetos cravings with some grain free paleo puffs: “For a snack, I have this hummus from the farmer’s market and I used to eat a bunch of hot Cheetos but that was before my acid reflux so these are Cheeto alternatives that I love that’s vegan.”
For her next meal, she shared a mushroom ball recipe. “These are some mushroom balls, and I made a truffle chickpea mushroom ball thing with some quinoa and salad from earlier making a reappearance,” she added.
Lastly, she shared her after dinner smoothie recipe.
“I made a peanut butter jelly smoothie by using some peanut butter, frozen strawberry, oats, oat milk and vanilla protein powder and ‘love from Jesus’,” she said.
“And yeah that was my day, and I feel very good, I feel very lit and full.’
Lizzo has been treating her fans with a slew of plant-based recipes over the past few months.
In another video over the weekend, Lizzo shared a recipe for a vegan breakfast scramble. “So being plant-based and vegan has been pretty easy, except for when I am hungover. I used to crave cheesy eggs,” the singer said.
