Iowa’s Corn Harvest is Far From Over, USDA Says
The Dakota states continue to struggle with harvest.
DES MOINES, Iowa -- U.S. corn farmers in Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota remain the furthest behind in corn harvesting, as Thanksgiving approaches.
In general, most U.S. farmers only have the last 15% of their soybeans to cut, according to Monday’s USDA Crop Progress Report.
North Dakota is only 15% harvested on corn, below a 76% five-year average. Iowa farmers have 64% of their corn out of the fields, compared with a 86% five-year average.
In its Weekly Crop Progress Report, the USDA pegged the U.S. corn harvest at 66% complete, below a five-year average of 85%, and below the trade’s expectation of 58%.
South Dakota farmers have 39% of their corn picked vs. a 82% five-year average. Other state totals include Illinois at 73% vs. a 93% five-year average, and Indiana at 72% complete vs. an 85% five-year average.
