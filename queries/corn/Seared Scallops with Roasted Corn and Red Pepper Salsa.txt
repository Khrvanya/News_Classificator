Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees or turn on grill to medium-high heat. Pull the hair o? the corn but leave the husk on. Place directly on the rack and turn once when the husk starts to brown. If using the grill, you may let some of the kernels char. Generally, when husks are browned the corn is done.
Remove corn from the oven/grill and cut the kernels from the cob with a knife and retain in a separate bowl. Add EVOO to skillet and heat on medium high heat. When hot add the Pepper, Green Onions and Garlic, toss and cook for about 2 minutes. Add the corn, heat the salsa through and set aside.
In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon of EVOO and Butter until butter is beginning to brown. Pat the scallops dry. Add a pinch of salt and pepper and place scallops seasoned side down in the pan. If cooking for a large party cook in batches, do not crowd the pan. When you see a brown crust begin to form on the bottom of the scallops, approximately 2-4 minutes, ?ip the scallops. If the scallops do not separate easily from the pan they are not done yet. Cook on the second side approximately 2 more minutes and remove from heat. The scallops should have brown edges and still be white in the middle.
Place the corn salsa on the plate and add the scallops on top or around the salsa. Garnish with any remaining sliced green onions. Enjoy!!!
