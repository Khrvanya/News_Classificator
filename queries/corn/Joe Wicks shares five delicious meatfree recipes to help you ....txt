HIS cookbooks are best­sellers and Joe Wicks reckons his new vegetarian offering will hit the spot too.
On day two of our serialisation of the fitness coach’s latest book, Veggie Lean in 15, Joe tells how the timing feels right to release a collection of weight-loss veg-only dishes as more people are cutting down on meat.

Joe, 32, says: “If you would’ve told me five years ago that I’d be releasing a whole book of veggie and vegan recipes I’d have said, ‘You’re having a larf’, but it’s my best project in years.
“The timing is right. A few years ago I shared a couple of veggie recipes on social media and people weren’t interested.
“It’s not like the world has gone veggie overnight, but people are just up for reducing their meat intake.
“I’ve designed this book mainly for meat-eaters like me. It’s a stepping stone for people who want more plants in their diet, but don’t know how to make that healthy and exciting.

“Whenever I used to pick up a veggie recipe book I found it very daunting. It was foreign to me and the recipes were always complicated. This book is classic Lean in 15 — going back to basics, removing the protein ­sources and showing you recognisable meals, just without meat. It’s about encouraging people to give it a go.”
He explains: “I still eat a burger or steak when I go out, but I’ve massively cut down and only eat half the meat I used to.
“Before, I’d have meat with every meal. Eggs and bacon for breakfast, fish for lunch and steak for dinner.  When I’ve had a good balanced veggie or vegan meal, I sleep better, feel less bloated and my energy lasts longer. It’s an emotional thing for me. I love food so much, so if I know I’m being more mindful, more sustainable and I’m spending less money, it’s a good feeling.”
