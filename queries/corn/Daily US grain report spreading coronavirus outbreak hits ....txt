US grain futures are solidly lower in early US pre-market trading Monday. Corn is around 6 cents lower, soybeans 10 to 12 cents lower and wheat is around 8 cents down.
Grain traders are spooked to start the trading week, as over the weekend the coronavirus illness that apparently originated in China has rapidly spread, killing at least 80 of its citizens, with nearly 8,500 cases now reported in China. Several Chinese cities are under quarantine. Several cases are now reported in the US as doctors are now saying the illness is more easily contractable. There are increasing worries the outbreak could hurt world global demand for grains, including possibly impacting the recently signed partial trade agreement between the US and China that included China buying much more U`S agricultural products. Look for buying interest in the grain futures markets to continue to be squelched until this situation stabilizes, which could be a while.
