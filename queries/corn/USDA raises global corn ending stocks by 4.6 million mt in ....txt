The US Department of Agriculture raised its estimates for global ending stocks for corn by 4.6 million mt to 300.56 million mt for the marketing year 2019-2020, it said in the December World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report Tuesday.
“Foreign corn ending stocks are raised from last month, largely reflecting increases for China, Bolivia, and Taiwan that more than offset declines for Canada, Colombia, and Paraguay,” USDA said.
The USDA also increased the forecast for global corn imports in 2019-2020 marginally to 167.56 million mt in December from the previous estimate of 167.44 million mt. Export estimates, however, have been lowered to 166.64 million mt from 167.05 million mt estimated earlier.
The USDA kept global corn production estimate for 2019-20 largely unchanged at 1.108 billion mt from 1.102 billion mt projected earlier in November.
The USDA maintained its estimates for US corn production for the marketing year 2019-20 (September-August) at 13.661 billion bushels (347.01 million mt), as projected in November.
Estimates for corn acreage, and harvested acres in the US were also kept unchanged from their November forecast of 89.9 million acres and 81.8 million acres, respectively.
Estimated yield for US corn was also maintained at 167 bushels per acre estimated previously in November, and so is the export estimate for US corn at 1.85 billion bushels.
The USDA also did not make any changes in the estimates for ending stocks of corn for the US or estimates for corn used for ethanol and maintained the numbers at 1.910 billion bushels and 5.375 billion bushels, respectively.
December WASDE can be anti-climactic in “tough” growing years, and this year will be no exception as markets are forced to wait until the January iteration of the production reports for some “final” clarity, Platts Analytics said in their report.
Corn exports estimates for Brazil and Argentina for 2018-19 were also unchanged from the previous estimate of 41 million mt, and 36 million mt, respectively.
According to USDA, the 2018-19 local marketing year in Brazil and Argentina runs through March 2019-February 2020.
For 2019-20 marketing year, Brazil corn exports are estimated at 36 million mt unchanged from last month and so are the exports from Argentina at 33.5 million mt.
USDA also kept its production forecast for Brazil and Argentina unchanged from its November estimates at 101 million mt and 50 million mt, respectively.
