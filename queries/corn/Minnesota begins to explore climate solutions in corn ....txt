First, he took recommendations under the state’s existing nutrient reduction strategy — a plan for reducing runoff into the Mississippi River, Lake Winnipeg and Lake Superior. The strategy calls for a variety of farming practices that also happen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with growing crops: planting grass buffers along waterways; planting cover crops that grow alongside cash crops; reducing tillage; taking land out of production for conservation; and several others.
Then, using research that shows the emissions reductions associated with each practice, Ciborowski calculated that overall agriculture emissions in the state could be reduced by 5 to 10 percent if the state follows through with its nutrient reduction strategy.
The three largest emissions sources from growing crops are applying fertilizer, tilling the soil and using tractors and other farm machinery, according to the report. Officials say the latest analysis looked only at emissions from crops, but future studies could include livestock.
“What this report is showing is that [these best practices] are out there, and they come in combination with other benefits to the state for the water quality, for the soil health,” said Frank Kohlasch, who manages the MPCA's air assessment section.
“How can we maximize the benefits for everyone involved, including the economics for the farmer?"
