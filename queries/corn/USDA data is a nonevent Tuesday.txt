Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities says that todays numbers don't change much.
“If we pasted last months USDA’s crop report next to today’s crop report we would virtually see the same numbers. The exports were left unchanged on corn, while the trade anticipated a drop. This is a mild surprise, giving corn continued support with the all the grains heavily oversold and the funds short. Spot grains sales also giving the grains support on a day of separation from the volatility of the financial markets,” Roose says.
Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, agrees that there is not a lot of reaction to today’s numbers.
“The world soybean ending stocks are up a bit on the better South American crops and Argentina’s government moves to impose higher taxes on imports. Not much of a reaction here and why should there be with the crude oil crisis and the coronavirus crisis still going on. In fact, the report came and went with hardly a blip, so people were not even really paying attention,” Scoville says.
Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that there is not much to say.
“With no WASDE surprises, markets will have to focus on planting weather in the U.S. and Chinese buying of soybeans anywhere in the world before they find some excitement. Prices of corn and soybeans do seem stretched to the downside, which can likely be attributed to the turmoil in outside markets, meaning buying by end users could pick up once COVID-19 fears subside,” Gilbertie says.
