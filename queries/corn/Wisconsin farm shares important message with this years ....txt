MENOMONIE, Wisc. (WTHR) - A Wisconsin farm is using its annual corn maze to send a very important message.
Govin's Farm in Menomonie unveiled the design for their corn maze Wednesday. It features the phrase "Your Life Matters" and the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline - 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
The farm said in a Facebook message revealing the maze that "suicide was something we unfortunately had to face and learn about. We hope to make a difference in someone's life and help them understand that they matter!"
The post said the family picks a maze theme that is important to their family.
"We had a family member that chose to end his life and on the way to the funeral this winter, we just decided we could have a corn maze," farmer John Govin told WEAU-TV .
Govin said the farm industry is hit particularly hard by suicide.
"There's an above average percentage of farmers that commit suicide. It's real stressful, the economy is real down and it's very hard for some farmers to continue and sometimes they think that maybe if I end it and I collect the life insurance, the farm will be better off without me," he said. "I can assure you that your loved ones would want you back. No matter what the case is somebody loves you and they want you back."
Have Hope is a partnership between WTHR and Community Health Network that promotes awareness and prevention of suicide in Indiana.
