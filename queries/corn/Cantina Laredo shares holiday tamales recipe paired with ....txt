Soak corn husk in warm water and set aside.
Mix all dry ingredients in a mixing bowl, then by hand incorporate the shortening. Once mix is even, add chicken stock one cup at a time--we want to have a consistency of an oily bouncy dough.
On the wet and soft corn husk, spread the dough, add the filling of your choice in the center, fold the tamale and pile.
Steam the tamales for 45 min to an hour.
