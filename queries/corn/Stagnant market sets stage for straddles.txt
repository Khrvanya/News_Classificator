U.S. corn prices are currently competitive globally; however, the market is watching to see how the coronavirus impacts the world economy. Despite positive movement on Thursday, March corn reversed on Friday and finished between $3.85 to $3.90 for the sixth straight week.
Following details three straddle trades I’ve done recently.
On 11/20/19 when March corn was trading $3.80, I sold a February $3.85 straddle (selling both a $3.85 put and a $3.85 call) on 10% of my 2019 production and collecting 20 cents total of premium.
If March corn is $3.85 on 1/24/20, I could keep nearly all of the 20 cents.
At $3.65 or lower I lose money penny for penny on this trade.
At $4.05 or higher I have to make a corn sale at $3.85 against March futures, but I still keep the 20 cents, so it’s like selling $4.05 March futures.
After watching corn prices drop from $4.10 to $3.77, it seemed like corn should start finding some support around $3.75. Now that harvest is finished and grain bins are locked, I look for prices to be range bound between $3.70 to $4.10 through January. Therefore, I want to place a trade that captures profits if we are in that price range.
As the options expiration approached on Friday, and the market was trading at $3.89, I bought back the call portion of the straddle for 4 cents and let the put options expire worthless. This left me with a 15-cent profit on the trade, but no additional futures sale was made.
On 1/22/20 when March corn was trading $3.90, I sold a $3.90 straddle (selling both a $3.90 put and a $3.90 call) on 10% of my 2019 production collecting just over 14 cents of premium total.
If March corn is $3.90 on 2/21/20, I could keep up to all of the 14 cents.
For every penny corn is below $3.90 I get less of the premium penny for penny until $3.76.
At $3.76 or lower I lose money penny for penny on this trade.
For every penny higher than $3.90 I get less of the premium penny for penny until $4.04.
At $4.04 or higher I have to make a corn sale at $3.90 against March futures, but I still keep the 14 cents, so it’s like selling $4.04.
As I expected, farmers mostly kept grain bins locked the past two months. With the February straddle mentioned above about to expire I knew I would have some profit from that trade that I could add to the outcome of this new March straddle I was placing. Corn has continued to trade between $3.85 and $3.90 over the last month and half and I look for corn to stay in that tight trading range through the end of February. In the last 4 months, March corn futures only closed below $3.76 4 times, and it’s been 3 months since it closed above $4.04.
My biggest concern is if the market declines due to the coronavirus over the next month. A big rally would be welcome because I have more corn to sell for both the 2019 crop as well as the 2020.
March straddle trade already in place:
On 10/16/19 when March corn was trading $4.00, I sold a $3.90 straddle (selling both a $3.90 put and a $3.90 call) on 10% of my 2019 production collecting just over 31 cents of total premium.
If March corn is $3.90 on 2/21/20, I could keep nearly all of the 31 cents
For every penny corn is below $3.90 I get less of the premium penny for penny until $3.59.
At $3.59 or lower I lose money penny for penny on this trade.
For every penny higher than $3.90 I get less of the premium penny for penny until $4.21.
At $4.21 or higher I have to make a corn sale at $3.90 against March futures, but I still keep the 31 cents, so it’s like selling $4.21.
Export pace seems to slow when March futures were around $4.10. While I’m disappointed corn dropped 10 cents from it’s high 2 days ago, I think selling this straddle will allow me to reach that level again or even higher. Once harvest is finished and grain bins are locked, I expect corn to be range bound between $3.70 to $4.10 through February. Since I think it’s unlikely the market will decrease significantly over the next few months, this straddle trade allows me to capture profits during a sideways market.
Looking forward: March options expiration on Feb. 21
With the profits from the first trade and the potential profits from the two straddles currently in place, I could capture a value equal to $4.20 March futures on 20% of my 2019 production if corn is at or above $3.90 futures. If March corn is between $3.60 and $3.90, I may not have a sale in place, but I’ll at least have made additional premium that I can add to another sale in the future. My risk in this trade would be if the coronavirus or some other unforeseen event causes corn to drop below $3.60.
