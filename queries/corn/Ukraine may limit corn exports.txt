KIEV, UKRAINE — Ukraine’s government is considering limiting exports for the remainder of the 2019-20 marketing year, Reuters reported on April 24.
Taras Vysotskiy, deputy economic minister, told Reuters that government officials will discuss the issue next week.
He did not say why Ukraine was considering restricting corn exports nor the limit that is being considered. Neighboring Romania and Russia have both restricted some grain exports recently due to disruptions caused by the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Ukraine, which harvested nearly 36 million tonnes of corn in 2019, already has exported 25.2 million tonnes of the commodity, 2.7 million tonnes more than the previous year.
APK-Inform told Reuters that Ukrainian corn export prices fell over the past week on declining demand from exporters and an expected decrease in biofuels production.
Ukraine, one of world’s top grain exporters, said earlier this month it was prepared to ban wheat exports for the remainder of the 2019-20 marketing year if sales exceeded limits agreed with traders.
