Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that the markets are in day two of what should be a 3-day buying spree by the funds.
“There is at least one more day to go. The reports offered something for everyone, with stocks estimates high but planted area estimates low. We are reacting to the planted area and are ignoring the stocks for now, but sooner or later those will come into play as well. So, the rally probably has a limited potential for a further rally, unless it turns hot and dusty in July. If that weather is realized, all bets are off as the market could really run. Forecasts are for warmer and drier, so the market will be on edge for the next week or two until we see how pollination and flowering will go," Scoville says.

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors are all bulled up and farmers should be prepared to take advantage of the rally.
"Grain traders were surprised by the USDA on Tuesday: corn acres fell nearly 5 million acres from the March report, while soybean acres rose just over 300,000 acres. Pre-report predictions were for a decline in corn acres near 1.5 million acres and an increase in soybean acres of nearly 1 million acres. The stocks section of the report was bearish corn and friendly soybeans; however, the acreage surprise gave the bulls the momentum," Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, "The friendly USDA report should give the grain bulls a chance to post higher highs on the charts. The fundamental picture is less bearish than Monday. However, the balance sheet still has the potential to be very comfortable at the end of the year. Be prepared to take advantage of the rally."
