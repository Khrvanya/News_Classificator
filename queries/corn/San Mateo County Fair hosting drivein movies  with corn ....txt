If this had been any other year, families would have been flocking this week to the 86th annual San Mateo County Fair for a day’s worth of high-flying carnival rides, midway games and food on a stick followed by a nighttime concert.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, forcing a postponement of the official event until 2021.
But there’s fun afoot at the fairgrounds this week and next.
Fair officials have announced they will host three drive-in movie nights, with “Dodgeball” showing on Friday, June 19, “Napoleon Dynamite” on Saturday, June 20; and “Independence Day” on Friday, June 26.
Fair-style concessions and cocktails will be available too. Longtime vendor Fanny’s Fabulous Funnel Cakes, operated by Ron and Mary Beth Mize, will be stationed at the San Mateo County Event Center and Fairgrounds to sell drive-thru corn dogs, cotton candy, funnel cakes, fried Oreos and fried Twinkies.
“We couldn’t miss the opportunity to come back even without the full fair,” Mary Beth Mize said.
