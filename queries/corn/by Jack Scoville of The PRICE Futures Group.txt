Global food prices rose in June for the first time this year, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization said Thursday, suggesting that the sharp declines experienced by food commodities as the coronavirus has hit demand could be easing.
The UN FAO’s monthly food price index, which tracks a basket of the most common foodstuffs such as grains, vegetable oils and meat, rose 2.4% in June to 93.2.
The rise halts four consecutive months of declining food prices, as measured by the FAO, that have come as supply has been slow to adjust to the pandemic’s sharp impact on demand.
The rise in the overall index has largely come from jumps in the price of sugar and vegetable oils. The FAO’s sugar price sub-index rose 10.6%, thanks to rising oil prices, which can incentivize Brazilian sugar mills to switch production from the sweetener to the biofuel ethanol.
A sub-index tracking vegetable oil prices rose 11.3% thanks largely to higher palm oil prices that have gained as the easing of coronavirus lock downs has led to increased imports, the FAO said.
Other foodstuffs tracked by the index also rose though the increases were more muted. Dairy prices rose 4% as imports from the Middle East and East Asia were slowly recovering, the FAO said.
Cereal and meat prices both rose by 0.6%. While demand for staple foods like cereals have been less affected by the virus, harvest this year of many grains are expected to be very strong. Strong supplies of poultry and bovine meat also weighed on meat prices, the FAO said.
KC HRW WHEAT July Jul. 06, 2020 96 Jun 29, 2020
General Comments: Winter Wheat markets were mixed, with Winter Wheat futures higher and Spring Wheat futures lower. There are ideas that Winter Wheat market have made a seasonal bottom. Yield reports from the Great Plains have been variable, but generally a little better than expected. Spring Wheat was lower on improving growing conditions for the crops. Spring Wheat markets show down trends as good conditions are also reported in much of Canada. It remains dry in the western sections of the Great Plains but this will aid harvest progress now. Better rains are reported in Europe and Russia. Russia could turn hot and dry starting this week but soil moisture is good for now. Australia remains in good condition.
Overnight News: The southern Great Plains should get scattered showers. Temperatures should be near to below normal. Northern areas should see scattered showers. Temperatures will average near to above normal. The Canadian Prairies should see scattered showers. Temperatures should average near to above normal.
Chart Analysis: Trends in Chicago are mixed to up with objectives of 514 and 537 September. Support is at 489, 481, and 471 September, with resistance at 503, 512, and 515 September. Trends in Kansas City are mixed. Support is at 434, 424, and 418 September, with resistance at 446, 450, and 454 September. Trends in Minneapolis are mixed to down with objectives of 506 and 488 September. Support is at 516, 512, and 506 September, and resistance is at 522, 524, and 527 September.
General Comments: Rice was mixed, with July sharply higher again USDA on Tuesday showed increased planted All Rice area at 2.921 million acres. The estimate was in line with trade expectations. USDA also showed that the quarterly stocks were in line with trade expectations but still tight. The new crop continues to show progress under mostly good conditions. The combination of good export buying in general and the buying inside the US due to the Coronavirus has made the market short old crop Rice. This appears to be factored into the price as there are ideas that the mills are well covered into new crop, but little Rice is available from producers. The crops that got planted are in very good condition in the south and near the Gulf Coast but planting was more problematic in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri. Ideas are that the long grain got planted and producers did not plant medium grain if some prevent planting was needed.
Overnight News: The Delta should get isolated showers. Temperatures should be near to above normal.
Chart Analysis: Trends are mixed to down with objectives of 1186 September. Support is at 1212, 1203, and 1201 September, with resistance at 1230, 1241, and 1246 September.
General Comments: Corn was higher on fund buying and on the Tuesday USDA reports. The quarterly stocks report was negative but the planted area report was very bullish and the surprise of the market. USDA showed that only 92 million acres of Corn got planted, an historically wide variance from its March intentions report that showed planting intentions at 97 million acres. The weather was in the background but is generally considered good for the crops. However, there are some forecasts for hot and dry weather in the Midwest for next week. Meats processors are back and are operating at about 95% of capacity. The backlog of Cattle and Hogs will slowly disappear under this scenario and meats wholesale and retail prices are falling. Ethanol demand is also improving as lock down orders are lifted in most states and in Europe, but the recent Corn rally has made processing margins negative again. Some states are starting to pull back from opening up as the Coronavirus cases have greatly increased and a new pandemic or a continuation of the old one is feared. Future gasoline and ethanol demand has become harder to define.
Overnight News: USDA said that China bought 202,000 tons of US Corn overnight.
Chart Analysis: Trends in Corn are up with objectives of 355 September. Support is at 339, 332, and 326 September, and resistance is at 346, 350, and 356 September. Trends in Oats are mixed. Support is at 286, 283, and 279 September, and resistance is at 292, 298, and 301 September.
11:26 ET – US ethanol inventories are now at their lowest level since January 2017, according to data from the EIA. Inventories dropped another 870,000 barrels this week, putting them at 20.2M barrels–the lowest since the week of Jan. 6, 2017. The consumption of leftover ethanol barrels is good news for US corn, which has held a bearish view of ethanol demand in the US since the coronavirus outbreak forced many plants to shut their doors either temporarily or permanently. Ethanol production also continued to recover, although it only grew by 7,000 barrels a day this week, rising to a rate of 900,000 barrels a day. Corn futures on the CBOT are up 2.8%, as grain traders eat into their ample short positions. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)
General Comments: Soybeans were higher on the smaller than expected increase in planted area to Soybeans by US farmers as indicated by USDA on Tuesday. The quarterly stocks report was as expected. China has become a much more active buyer of Soybeans here in the US and has promised to ramp up purchases in order to comply with commitments it made under the Phase One trade deal. These words are in doubt now due to the war of words between the two countries over Hong Kong. China has remained a very active buyer in South America even as it has increased Soybeans buying here in the US, so the overall amount taken from the US might not match the hopes of the trade. Brazil prices have been creeping higher for the rest of the world as it starts to run out of Soybeans to export, so China and the rest of the world will look to the US and Argentina for additional supplies. The US weather is considered good for growing Soybeans at this time with rains seen over the weekend and more again yesterday. Hot and dry weather is possible next week. USDA showed very good crop conditions again this week in its weekly update.
Overnight News: USDA said tthat China bought 126,000 tons of US new crop Soybeans overnight.
Chart Analysis: Trends in Soybeans are up with objectives of 891 August. Support is at 880, 872, and 868 August, and resistance is at 896, 900, and 915 August. Trends in Soybean Meal are up with objectives of 301.00 August. Support is at 292.00, 290.00, and 286.00 August, and resistance is at 298.00, 300.00, and 305.00 August. Trends in Soybean Oil are mixed. Support is at 2790, 2710, and 2680 August, with resistance at 2850, 2890, and 2910 August.
General Comments: Palm Oil closed higher on the strength in the outside markets. Higher world petroleum prices helped with ideas of increased bio fuels demand Palm Oil has been hoping for better demand from importers as world economies slowly open after being closed by the Coronavirus epidemic. Indonesia continues to focus its Palm Oil on internal demand for bio fuels. Canola was higher. Canola was higher on a weaker Canadian Dollar and Chicago price action The planted area estimates were above trade expectations but below the previous year. The weather has been warmer the past couple of weeks after weeks of cold and wet weather.
Chart Analysis: Trends in Canola are mixed. Support is at 472.00, 470.00, and 468.00 November, with resistance at 480.00, 482.00, and 484.00 November.
