I love Mexican Street Corn, so I created my version of this delicious corn. “Shmeared” with cheese, mayonnaise and spices this street corn is truly finger licking delicious.
1) To cook the corn, simply boil it for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set the ears of corn aside.
2) To make the “shmear” for the corn, in a large bowl stir together the mayonnaise, sour cream, Salsa Queen Queso Chipotle Dip, Shredded sharp cheddar cheese, queso fresco, drumhead Dorito’s Tapatío chips, chili powder, season salt and pepper until fully combined.
3) Smear the “shmear” all over the cooked corn on the cob. If desired, use some additional shredded cheese to press all over the “shmear” before serving.
4) To make the traditional corn on the cob, spread butter over a hot ear of corn so that it melts. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, serve and enjoy!
