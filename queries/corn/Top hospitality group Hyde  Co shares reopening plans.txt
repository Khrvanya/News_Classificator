One of Bristol's biggest and best-loved hospitality groups has shared how it plans to reopen its venues safely from July 4 onwards.
Hyde & Co has publicly released its post-lockdown manifesto, detailing how it will ensure the wellbeing of staff and customers, as the doors to its bars and restaurants open for the first time in three months.
Founded 10 years ago , Hyde & Co operates some of Bristol’s most established and well-known places to eat and drink, including the eponymous Hyde & Co bar, The Milk Thistle, The Ox, Pata Negra, Bambalan and Seven Lucky Gods.
Like all hospitality groups it was forced to close all of its venues in March due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but is now preparing to throw the doors open once more after the Government eased lockdown restrictions further.

The manifesto, which can be read in full here , outlines the major changes that will be implemented at all of its sites.
Customers will need to sign health declarations upon entry to its bars and restaurants and will need a keycode or key to access toilets, to ensure there is no more than one person in them at a time.
Restaurants will be offering reduced menus to limit food wastage while The Ox, Pata Negra and Milk Thistle, which are all located in the Old City, could see an increase in outdoor seating, benefiting from the council's pedestrianisation plans .
