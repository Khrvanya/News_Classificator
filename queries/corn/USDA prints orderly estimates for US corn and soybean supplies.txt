Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that today’s WASDE report has China’s impact coming through it.
“The highlight of this report is the influence of China on the global grain markets, notably that China is expected to take almost all of the world’s soybean surplus with a projected increase in Chinese soybean imports of over 5% vs. last year. In addition, China is currently expected to hold over half (51%) of global wheat inventories. Weather and the approaching corn pollination season will determine price direction from this point forward,” Gilbertie says.
Jason Ward, Northstar Commodity, says that there is nothing too earth-shaking in the report.
"The 2019 U.S. yield/harvested acres came down for corn, which got us 46 million bushels less production. The biggest change was 10 bu/acre reduction in the corn yield in North Dakota to 131 bu/acre. This entire production decline was more than offset by a 50 million bushel reduction in corn used for ethanol which was also needed based on current usage pace. But, with more plants coming online each week, we should be able to avoid further reductions," Ward says.
The disappointment in the report today is the U.S. soybean export target for old crop which continues to be cut, 100 million bushels last month and 25 million bushels today, Ward says.
"This gives the market lower confidence in U.S./China export business in the old crop space. With the U.S. Dollar testing 2-month lows and the Brazilian Real at 2-month highs, there were many in the trade expecting the export target to be unchanged, or possibly even be lowered," Ward says.
Ward added, "The math works like this, we need to average 3.5 mil/bu/week of old crop soybean sales to reach the annual target. The shipments need to increase, or these sales will simply be rolled over to new crop. But, as long as they are not cancelled larger sales in the next 13 weeks of the marketing year will move over to new crop and result in lower ending stocks."
The other surprise is that USDA continues to use 124.0 million metric tons  for Brazil’s soybean production, higher than nearly every private sector estimate and Brazil’s own government estimate, Ward says.
"This kept today's estimate of world soybean ending stocks from falling further, while the 1 mmt. cut in Argentine soy production is right in-line with private estimates. So, USDA looks high on Brazil production according to industry experts, but they have Argentina very close, and we think they are a little too bearish to U.S. exports of soybeans for the old crop," Ward says.
