Iowa farmers record no progress.
INDIANOLA, Iowa — The U.S. corn planting pace is at a single digit, with most states behind a year ago.
On Monday, the USDA released its first 2020 Crop Progress Report that includes corn planting ratings.
U.S. farmers have 3% of the corn crop in the ground, equal to a year ago and below a five-year average of 4%.
Individual states such as Kansas and Missouri have 6% and 4% planted, respectively.
Meanwhile, Illinois and Indiana farmers have 1% of their corn seeded. Iowa has not recorded any planting progress.
In its report Monday, the USDA rated the U.S. winter wheat crop as 62% good/excellent, unchanged from a week ago. Also, 6% of the crop is headed, below the 7% five-year average.
Crop progress and condition estimates are based on survey data collected each week from early April through the end of November, according to the USDA report.
“The nonprobability crop progress and condition surveys include input from approximately 3,600 respondents whose occupations provide them opportunities to make visual observations and frequently bring them in contact with farmers in their counties. Based on standard definitions, these respondents subjectively estimate the progress of crops through various stages of development, as well as the progress of producer activities. They also provide subjective evaluations of crop conditions,” the USDA stated in its Monday report.
Most respondents complete their questionnaires on Friday or early Monday morning and submit them to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) field offices in their states by mail, telephone, fax, email, or through a secured internet website. A small number of reports are completed on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, according to the USDA report.
