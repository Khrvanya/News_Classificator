500g corn kernels from 6 large (or 8 small) corn cobs. You can also use frozen corn kernels, defrosted or 2 x 420g tinned corn kernels, drained (see tips above)
1.Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, then cook the pasta until very al dente. I usually cook mine two minutes less than the packet instructions, knowing it will finish cooking when you combine it with the sauce. Overcooking your pasta will make it turn to mush. Before draining your pasta, reserve a cup of the cooking water.
2.Meanwhile, remove the corn kernels from the cobs. Start by shucking them, removing any stringy pieces, and giving them a wash. Next hold the corn upright in the middle of a large bowl with shallow edges to catch the kernels. Use a knife to shave down the sides of the corn to remove the kernels, rotating until you are left with the bare cob (you can keep the cob and add it to your stock when making corn soup).
3.Heat the oil in a large, wide, heavy-based pot over medium heat and add the garlic. Cook until very lightly golden and fragrant (around a minute), then add the corn and a pinch of sea salt, stirring for another minute to coat the kernels in the garlicky oil.
4.Add the butter and cream and allow it to bubble away gently for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.
5.When the pasta is cooked, add it to the pan along with a good splash of the pasta cooking water. Stir to coat the pasta in the creamy sauce, adding more pasta cooking water as required (I usually end up adding the whole cup). Add the lime zest and parmesan. Keep stirring to allow the cheese to melt, then taste too see if you want to add more salt. Right before serving, add the basil leaves and some freshly cracked black pepper.
