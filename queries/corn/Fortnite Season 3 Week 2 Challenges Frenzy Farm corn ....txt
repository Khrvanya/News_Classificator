Fortnite Season 3 Week 2 Challenges: Frenzy Farm corn fields location
Deal damage from inside a cornfield at Frenzy Farm is one of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 3 Week 3 Challenges.
This challenge is part of Fortnite Season 3 Week 3 Challenges and you'll have to deal a total of 100 damage points while in a cornfield at Frenzy Farm. If you know what a corn plant looks like, you'll have no trouble visualizing where you'll need to be ambushed to complete the challenge.
Taller than a standing character, the corn plants are the perfect place to hide and trap enemies. You'll find them mostly south of the big red barn at Frenzy Farm.
Corns work much like bushes: you're invisible if you enter the grove. To complete the challenge, you'll need to deal damage while in the heart of the crop. The simplest way to do this is to find a weapon in the area and then hide in a field. Fighting will sometimes be "blind" due to the lack of visibility, but with a little patience you should be able to inflict the right amount of damage.
We recommend the Shotgun or Machine Gun, as fighting in the middle of fields will usually be at close range. Don't forget to listen carefully: footsteps will be your main allies in the challenge!
