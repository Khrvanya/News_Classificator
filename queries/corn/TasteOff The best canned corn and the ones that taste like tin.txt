Corn on the cob is an awesome treat, a perfect side for barbecued anything. Off the cob, those rich, buttery kernels become recipe superheroes — in soup, salad, sides or even dessert. Corn is the pop of color in chili, the sweet note in salsa, the richness in cheesy pudding. It delivers a nice punch of fiber, protein and potassium, too.
The awesome thing about corn is that, unlike so many vegetables, it’s nearly as good out of a can as it is fresh. Sure, most canned corn has a dash of added salt, but rarely so much that it’s problematic.
Great canned corn is second only to fresh. It’s naturally sweet, crisp and tender, with just a touch of salt. But beware the substandard corn. Far too many cans are filled with corn that’s tough, tasteless, mushy, sugary or so salty that the corn flavor goes AWOL. Always check the salt and sugar content before you buy. Good canned corn has only three ingredients: corn, water and salt, in that order.
Here’s the scoop on cans to grab and those to skip. Nutrition details refer to ½ cup servings.
Crispy kernels and buttery flavor push this canned corn to the top of the grocery list. The kernels are large and juicy, and the tender skin has a delicate pop. 60 calories, 1.5 g fat, 200 mg sodium, 7 g sugar, 2 g protein. 99 cents for 15.25 ounces. (4 stars)
Bright little kernels with deep corn flavor and a hit of natural sweetness make this a terrific choice. The label claims the corn is packed fresh in season — and it tastes like it. 60 calories, .5 g fat, 200 mg sodium, 2 g sugar, 1 g protein. $1.39 for 15 ounces at Smart & Final. (4 stars)
The corn in this nearly juice-free can has bold flavor and good color, but the kernels are slightly mushy and it’s too sweet, due to added sugar. This would bring big corn flavor to a dessert or casserole. 120 calories, .75 g fat, 345 mg sodium, 7.5 g sugar (3 g added sugar), 1.5 g protein. $1.23 for 11 ounces. (3 stars)
When the recipe calls for large, good-looking kernels that don’t need massive corn flavor, this brand works. Its slightly briny flavor would not be noticed in a soup or stew. 60 calories, .5 g fat, 200 mg sodium, 2 g sugar, 1 g protein. 79 cents for 15.25 ounces at Smart & Final. (2½ stars)
Detecting the fire-roasted flavor here requires imagination, and the sugar content makes it taste like corn candy, but at least the tiny kernels are crisp. This might work in a dish with many ingredients, but not one where corn is the highlight. 70 calories, 1 g fat, 320 mg sodium, 6 g sugar, 1 g protein. $2.19 for 14.75 ounces at Raley’s. (1½ stars)
Minimal corn flavor and tough skins make this pricey can one to avoid. It’s easy to find far more flavor for half the price. 60 calories, .5 g fat, 260 mg sodium, 5 g sugar, 2 g protein. $1.99 for 15.25 ounces at Safeway. (1 star)
Oops. It was corn once, but now it’s tiny kernels of overcooked nothingness in cloudy water. A hint of metal is literally the only flavor of note. 80 calories, 1 g fat, 300 mg sodium, 5 g sugar (3 g added sugar), 2 g protein. $1 for 15.25 ounces at Lucky. (No stars)
