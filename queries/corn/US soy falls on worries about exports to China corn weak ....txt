CHICAGO — U.S. soybean futures sank 1.3% to a one-week low on Thursday, pressured by concerns about falling export demand from the world’s top soy importer due to rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, traders said.
“It does not take much,” said Mark Schultz chief market analyst at Northstar Commodity. “You have got a little bit more heated rhetoric between the two countries.”
Traders shrugged off a weekly U.S. Agriculture Department report that showed export sales of soybeans rose to a bigger-than-expected 1.669 million tonnes. The report showed sales to China of 1.199 million tonnes in the week ended May 14 but no fresh deals have been reported since then.
Corn futures also were lower while wheat firmed, on track for its third straight day of gains, due to tight supplies in key exporter Russia.
“Wheat has rebounded in a hurry following Monday move lows, at least adding in some risk premium with less-than-favorable weather in the region that basically sets the global export pace,” Matt Zeller, director of market information at INTL FCStone, said in a note to clients.
At 10:52 a.m. CDT (1543 GMT), Chicago Board of Trade July soybean futures were down 10-1/2 cents at $8.36-1/4 a bushel.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China over the coronavirus on Wednesday, calling the $2 billion Beijing has pledged to fight the pandemic “paltry.”
