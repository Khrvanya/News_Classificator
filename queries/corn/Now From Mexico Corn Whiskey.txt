Abasolo Ancestral Corn Whisky, made from nixtamalized corn, has a toasty aroma and some honeyed sweetness.
We appreciate tequila, have tried mezcal and are sampling sotol. Still there is more to learn about Mexican spirits. Corn whiskey, for example, is a rarity. But now there’s one that’s new. Abasolo, El Whisky de Mexico , from Jilotepec de Abasolo, just north of Mexico City, is made entirely from heritage corn that has undergone nixtamalization, like masa. The 86-proof spirit — made in copper pot stills and aged in oak — is pale gold, has a toasty aroma and some honeyed sweetness that tames the alcohol. It’s excellent with a splash of pineapple juice and a squeeze of lime. Through Aug. 1, the profits from sales are being donated to Another Round Another Rally, a nonprofit based in Phoenix that supports the hospitality industry.
