Last Weekly Crop Progress Report Still Shows Delays.
DES MOINES, Iowa – As snow swept through the Upper Midwest Monday, the USDA released its last Weekly Crop Progress Report of the year, one that was extended due to harvest delays. It still showed corn harvest well behind normal in a few states.
In its Weekly Crop Progress Report, the USDA pegged the U.S. corn harvest at 92% complete on December 8, below a five-year average of 100%.
North Dakota farmers still struggle; 43% of their corn is picked. Wisconsin corn was only 74% complete compared with a 95% five-year average. Other state totals include Illinois at 96% vs. a 100% five-year average, and Iowa at 95% complete when the crop harvest would normally be complete.
This last report of the season did not include soybeans, which were 96% harvested nationally last week.
