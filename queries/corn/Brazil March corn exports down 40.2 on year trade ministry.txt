New Delhi — Corn exports from Brazil in March fell by 40.2% year on year to 494,600 mt, according to the data released by Brazil's Ministry of economy, industry, foreign trade and services.
Record exports during the last marketing year and losses in the first corn crop yields in southern parts of Brazil this season have depleted domestic stocks.

Brazil is expected to export 34 million mt of corn in 2019-20, which refers to the period between February 2020-January 2021, as compared with the estimate of 41.17 million mt in the previous marketing season, according to Conab.
