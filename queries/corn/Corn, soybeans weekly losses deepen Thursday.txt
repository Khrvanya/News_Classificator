DES MOINES, Iowa -- On Thursday, the CME Group’s farm markets close weaker.
At the close, the March corn futures finished 12¢ lower at $3.75¼. May corn futures closed 11½¢ lower at $3.82¾.
March soybean futures settled at 4¾¢ lower at $9.24¼. May soybean futures ended 4½¢ lower at $9.37½.

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says the bulls in the market ignored the big U.S.-China trade deal signing event.
“Phase One was signed, but according to the traders, that big event was already priced in. China, moreover, said the tariffs would stay intact until Phase Two. That spooked investors a bit. After the significant run-up in futures the past six weeks, grains are pulling back a bit,” Kluis stated in a daily note to customers.
Kluis added, “After the announcement that the U.S.-China trade deal was signed, we saw that a lot of the trade action was already built into the prices. It will take a bullish USDA report to get the market to rally much.”
On Thursday, private exporters reported to the USDA export sales of 180,000 metric tons of soybean cake and meal for delivery to the Philippines during the 2019/2020 marketing year.
The marketing year for soybean cake and meal began October 1.

On Wednesday, the CME Group’s farm markets show little life.

Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says the markets are now quietly trading sideways in corn and soybeans.
“March corn continues to find any traction moving higher than $3.90 and March beans with the $9.40 zone. I believe that the signing of Phase One of the U.S.-China trade agreement was fully priced into the market, soybeans made a 60¢ run shortly after the original announcement was made. As the details of Phase One become more known, we may see more of a reaction from the market. New-crop beans are trading within 20¢ of their one-year highs. With SA preparing to bring forward what is expected to be a record crop, pressure on the U.S. soybean contract seems reasonable,” O’Connell says.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says the bulls in the market are looking for fresh news to trade.
“Grain prices have moved into a quiet trading range since the dull USDA report last week. The report did not give traders any reason to get excited. Now, everyone is waiting for the next headline that will have an impact on grains. Will the bulls be able to continue the rally on little or no fresh news,” Kluis stated in a daily note to customers.
Kluis added, “The South American crop is not likely to break records this year. However, it has the potential to be a big crop nonetheless. We will likely see hedge pressure from the South American farmer as a result of the trade deal.”

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors will be watching this week’s U.S.-China trade agreement’s Phase One announcement.
“Nearby corn futures closed above last week’s high on Monday. The means the next resistance is now at the $4 benchmark, ” Kluis stated in a daily note to customers.
Kluis added, “How fast will Chinese buying develop after the Phase One trade agreement is signed on Wednesday? A lot of Chinese buying could spike grain prices higher.”

The marketing year for corn began September 1.
Matt Tranel, cash advisor for Commodity Risk Management Group, says now that January’s WASDE & quarterly stocks reports are out and largely released neutral information for price direction, the market now turns its attention to January 15.
“The Phase One deal is scheduled to be signed on Wednesday. It appears that the market is hesitant to push soybean prices in a positive direction because whenever we have heard talk of progress on trade with China in the past, it has turned out poorly, and traders who were long the market were burned badly. Despite this hesitancy, we have never been within 48 hours of getting this deal done and the trade is cautiously hopeful, too,” Tranel says.
Tranel added, “Corn is just trading the range at this point. The reports failed to provide a spark to the higher end, but was friendly enough to trade back up from our Friday lows. The range has essentially been $3.72 to $3.92 based upon the March board and 20¢ to 25¢ winter ranges have essentially defined the corn market the last few years,” Tranel says.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors will be watching South America’s crop progress and demand for U.S. products.
“Will we see action at the January-to-March soybean continuation gap? If March pulls back 9¢, then that is a logical area of support on the continuation chart. Also, watch for a close above $9.60 when the March contract becomes the nearby contract. In that case, we could see a major chart breakout to the top side,” Kluis stated in a daily note to customers.
Kluis added, “The positive close in the grain markets (after what we viewed as negative reports) is a positive signal for the grain markets. Now all attention is on crop and weather development in South America.”
