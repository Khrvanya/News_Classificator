Dr. Pimple Popper is back at it with pilar cyst she removed from a patient's scalp.
Dr. P compared the process of pushing out the cyst to giving birth.
Once the cyst was removed, she noted that it resembled candy corn.
Dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper , is at it again with her pilar cyst removal from her patient's scalp. She's removed these types of cysts from her patient's scalps before (check them out here and here ), and every time it's just as satisfying.
"Congratulations! Itâ€™s a pilar cyst! ðŸ¥° #drpimplepopper," she captioned her post.
The video begins with the camera zoomed in on a patient's scalp. The cyst has been sliced open, so it's a bit bloody as we see Dr. P go to work.
"Are you okay? I'm not trying to push your head back. Yes, push back!" says Dr. P as she starts to press the cyst, asking her patient to help with opposing force to get the cyst to budge.
"It's coming, it's like you're giving birth!" says Dr. P as she uses her gloved fingers to push out the cyst.
"Got it! Phew, sorry!" she says as she uses a lot of pressure to get the cyst to come out.
"Did it come out?" asks her patient.
"Almost! It's sticking out," says Dr. P.
"Do you want me to push?" the patient asks again.

Part of the cyst comes out, but she grabs a pair of pliers to get the rest of it, which breaks apart and reveals some yellow and orange-looking gunk.
"Okay, we pushed out the inside part. It's like candy corn this time!" she says. "You have candy corn on the back of your head!"
