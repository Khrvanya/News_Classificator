After "starring" in a video which has been making the rounds on social media, South Western Division police nabbed the suspect on Friday morning.
In the viral video, the man holds a gun and shows his face. He explicitly threatens to use it to kill someone named Darnell.
He said, "as soon as I get back corn for this shutty" (meaning bullets for his gun), he intended to gun down his target.
In an anti-crime exercise in the Siparia district between 3.30 am and 7.30 am on Friday, police arrested him for having a round of 50 calibre ammunition which is 5.5 inches long. Snr Supt Cooper, ASP Ramdeen and Insp Jaggernath co-ordinated the exercise which was supervised by Ramsaran. It also included officers of the Siparia CID and the South Western Divisional Task Force.
The suspect lives at St John's Branch Trace in South Oropouche.
