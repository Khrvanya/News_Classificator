U.S. Corn Harvest Is Still Not Finished, USDA Says
Progress was made from a week ago.
DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. farmers have not completed the 2019 corn and soybean harvests yet, according to the USDA.
In its weekly USDA Crop Progress Report, the USDA pegged the U.S. corn harvest at 89% complete, equal to the trade’s expectations and below the five-year average of 98%.
Last week’s report showed many states still struggling to finish.
In this week’s report, it shows that North Dakota is only finished with 36% of its corn harvest.
Michigan and Wisconsin are 66% complete with corn picking.
South Dakota farmers remain at 80% finished vs. a 94% rate last year.
The USDA pegged the U.S. soybean harvest as 96% complete vs. 97% a year ago.
While today’s report was the last Crop Progress report of the 2019 season for soybeans, USDA will release another report, next week, for corn harvest progress.
During the first two weeks of December, NASS will survey over 81,000 United States producers, the USDA announced in its weekly Crop Progress Report Monday.
“One of USDA’s largest survey efforts, the responses will provide the final information about 2019 U.S. row crops focusing on harvested acreage, production, and storage. The survey will also be used to help establish county level estimates used by the Farm Service Agency for the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program and the Risk Management Agency to administer insurance programs,” USDA stated Monday.
In addition, hog producers will be asked about their current inventory, pig crop, and farrowing intentions for the next six months, according to the announcement.
The results will be available beginning with the Hogs and Pigs report on December 23, followed by the Annual Crop Production Summary and other reports on January 10. County-level row-crop estimates will be released later in 2020, according to the USDA Monday.
