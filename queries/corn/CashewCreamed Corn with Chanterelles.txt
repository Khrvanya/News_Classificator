Place the cashews in a container and add cold water to just barely cover the nuts completely. Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours or overnight.
Using a blender, pur√©e until liquified. You can also use an immersion / hand blender, but it won't be as smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add water a little at a time to reach the consistency of cream.
Prepare the chanterelles by swishing them in a bowl of water to remove the dirt. Wipe any remaining debris and cut the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, corn, onion and garlic. Cover and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Season with salt and pepper. Add cream, water and parsley. Cover and cook another 5 minutes until heated through. Add more water if the consistency seems too thick. Serve hot.
1 cup of nuts will yield a little more than 1 cup of cashew cream, depending on how much water is added. Exact measurements don't matter, but it's much easier to make a larger quantity, such as 2 cups of nuts at a time. Refrigerate the unused cream for about 4-5 days, or freeze in small containers to thaw and use as needed. Frozen cashew cream lasts 1-2 months, but is never quite as good as fresh.
