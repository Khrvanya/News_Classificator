To prepare the jalapeño-feta butter, in a small bowl, mash together the butter, jalapeño, feta, cilantro, garlic, lime or lemon juice, salt and coriander.
Divide the butter equally onto six pieces of parchment paper large enough to wrap them snugly (6-inch squares should do it), form into logs, and wrap well, twisting the ends like candy wrappers. Chill for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days before using, or freeze for up to 3 months.
Light the grill or heat the broiler, arranging the rack about 4 inches from the heat source. Brush corn lightly with oil. Grill until charred on all sides, 3 to 6 minutes total.
Transfer corn to plates, and serve each ear with a log of jalapeño-feta butter for rubbing onto the ear.
