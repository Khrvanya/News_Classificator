USDA estimates 2020/2021 U.S. corn crop at a record, sees rise in amount used for ethanol
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday estimated the U.S. corn crop at a record 16 billion bushels for the 2020/2021 marketing year, according to its latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report .The USDA also expects that corn used for ethanol will increase to 5.2 billion bushels, up from the 2019/2020 COVID-19 reduced level of 4.95 billion bushels due to an expected rebound in U.S. gasoline consumption. However, with total U.S. corn supply rising more than use, 2020/2021 U.S. ending stocks are up 1.2 billion bushels from last year and, if realized, would be the highest since the 1987/1988 marketing year, the USDA said. The most-active July corn contract CN20,
traded at $3.19 a bushel, up half a cent, following an intraday low of $3.14 1/2 in Chicago.
