Corn futures traded sharply higher on Tuesday to touch their highest levels since March after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported a smaller-than-expected estimate for acres of planted corn for this year. Corn planted area in 2020 is forecast at 92 million acres, up 3% from last year, according to the USDA's Acreage report. However, the average guess for corn planted acreage by all analysts was at 95.207 million acres, according to Reuters. "Assuming trend line yield of 178.5 bushels per acre," the forecasted acreage "trims the corn balance sheet by nearly a half a billion bushels," said Sal Gilbertie, president and chief investment officer at Teucrium Trading. "Corn is the king of the grain complex and with the near record amount of shorts on the corn futures side, there is a pretty significant short covering rally occurring." The most-active September corn contract CU20,
rose 13 cents, or 4%, to trade at $3.41 3/4 a bushel in Chicago. Prices for a most-active contract haven't traded or settled at levels this high since March, according to FactSet data.
