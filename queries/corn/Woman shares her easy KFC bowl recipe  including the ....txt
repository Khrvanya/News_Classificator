IT'S got to the point in lockdown where we would literally give anything to get our KFC fix.
While we're eagerly waiting for the fast food chain to open its doors again, we've been passing the time making crispy chicken drumsticks and Zinger wings at home - and now one fan has revealed how to put together the perfect KFC bowl yourself.

To start with, she filled the bottom of her baking tray with mashed potato and topped it with tinned corn.
Next, she added 15 already-cooked chicken nuggets and covered it all with two cups of cheese.
Then all the mum had to do was pop it in the oven for a couple of minutes until the cheese had melted. And there you have it, a homemade KFC bowl.

But wait, we know what you're thinking - WHAT ABOUT THE GRAVY?
Well, the mum only added an instant gravy sachet for herself as she's the only one in her family who actually likes it.
Although if you did want to make KFC's actual gravy at home, then this mum's recipe has got you covered.
Unsurprisingly, her simple method has proved a hit with other members of the group.
How to make your own 'KFC' bowl:
Ingredients: one serving of mashed potato, one tin of corn, 15 chicken nuggets, shredded cheese of your choice for topping, instant gravy sachet
As well as racking up hundreds of "likes", one user replied: "That's fresher than the KFC Bowl!"
Another suggested: "We use chicken gravy here and throw bacon bits on top. Can't beat bacon."
"This is a family favourite," a third added. "We use homemade chicken gravy though and allow the kids build their own."
