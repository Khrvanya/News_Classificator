A top US governor has told people to use corn cobs instead of toilet paper as coronavirus panic buying continues to sweep the world and cause shortages.
Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who is famed for his homespun pronouncements, tweeted: ‘Those of us from rural south know how to handle toilet paper shortage.
‘Eat more corn on the cob! The corn isn’t important, but the cobs are free and work great!  (Just don’t flush them!) You’re welcome!’
Huckabee’s tweet has since been retweeted and liked thousands of times, with many commenters disgusted by the suggestion, while others hailed him for what they said was common sense advice.
The Republican governor – whose daughter Sarah Sanders was White House Press Secretary between July 2017 and July 2019 – spoke as toilet paper continues to prove one of the most popular items among panic buyers stocking up for coronavirus quarantine or lockdowns.

Lengthy lines have formed outside supermarkets and wholesalers such as Costco across the US, with police even called to deal with scuffles betweens shoppers fighting for the bathroom product.
Huckabee has previously hit the headlines after claiming that LGBT rights pose the ‘greatest threat’ to American morality. He has also likened abortion to the Holocaust, and made controversial comments about Islam.
