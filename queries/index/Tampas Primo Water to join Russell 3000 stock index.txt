TAMPA — Primo Water Corp. said Friday it’s been selected to join the Russell 3000 stock market index, effective June. 29.
“A testament to our transformation and future,” Primo chief executive officer Tom Harrington said in announcing the news. “Inclusion in the Russell indexes is an important milestone for Primo and will increase the overall awareness and exposure of our stock within the investment community.”
The Russell 3000 index is made up of 3,000 large stocks that represent about 98 percent of all U.S.-incorporated equities.
Primo operated as Cott Corp., distributing drinks such as RC Cola, until early this year. That’s when it changed its name as part of a move to become a “pure play” water distributor.
