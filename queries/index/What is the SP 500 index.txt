How can you invest in the S&P 500 index?
You can invest in the S&P 500 index by purchasing shares of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) designed to passively track the index. These are investment vehicles that own all the stocks in the S&P 500 index in proportional weights.
One good example is the S&P 500 funds offered by Vanguard. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO) , which trades just like a stock, and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFIAX) mutual fund both have extremely low fees and deliver virtually identical performance to the S&P 500 index over time.
In addition, S&P 500 futures contracts trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which allows investors to essentially buy or sell options contracts on the entire index.
Is the S&P 500 index the best investment for you?
Legendary stock market investor Warren Buffett has famously said that a low-cost S&P 500 index fund is the best investment that most people can make. And it’s not difficult to see why. Over long periods, the S&P 500 has delivered annualized total returns of 9%-10%, and you can invest in a passive S&P 500 fund for virtually no cost.
To be clear, if you have the time, knowledge, and desire to properly research stocks and maintain a portfolio, we (and Warren Buffett) feel that it’s certainly possible to achieve superior investment returns relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. However, not everyone has the time and discipline needed to invest in stocks that way, and newer investors in particular may be better off using an S&P 500 index fund to invest until they build up their knowledge.
In a nutshell, investing in the S&P 500 is a way to get broad exposure to the profitability of American businesses without too much dependence on any individual company’s performance. Over time, the S&P 500 can produce strong returns in your portfolio, and with minimal effort on your part.
