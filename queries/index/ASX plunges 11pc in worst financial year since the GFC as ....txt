More broadly, and less spectacularly, healthcare, technology and consumer staples were the best performing sectors in the financial year, and they were the only ones that posted gains.
"It's not surprising to see the healthcare sector being the best performer in the financial year," Ms Lee said, identifying Fisher & Paykel Healthcare (+120pc) as the best stock in that sector.
"Of course their respirators are in great demand across the globe, and it's also done well in selling hospital consumables.
Some of the best performing stocks in the last 12 months were:
Zoono Group (+2,637pc), which manufacturers sanitiser products,
De Grey Mining (+1,257pc), a gold explorer,
They benefited from trends during the pandemic, including the price of gold surging to a 7.5-year high (above $US1,772 an ounce) — or record levels, in Australian dollar terms.
On the flip side, energy was the worst performing sector — plagued by fears of an oil oversupply amid a plunge in demand, since far fewer people are driving or flying during this pandemic.
The price of West Texas crude futures even sank into negative territory (-$US37 per barrel) in April as traders had to pay suppliers to get rid of all that stock.
Financials were the second worst performing sector, given bank profit margins will be squeezed by ultra-low interest rates and a potential surge in customers defaulting on their loans during an economic crisis.`
Media, travel, and oil and gas companies dominated the list of worst performers, including FAR Ltd (-84pc), Seven West Media (-80pc), Southern Cross Media (-80pc) and Flight Centre (-70pc).
"At the heart of this volatility is a health crisis, and the key for investors is to ask: is it going to look better or worse in three months' time?" Ms Lee said.
"And if the answer is 'better', there could be a trading opportunity.
She also warned that market volatility isn't going away any time soon.
"But don't forget, the US election is in November, which should have have an impact."
