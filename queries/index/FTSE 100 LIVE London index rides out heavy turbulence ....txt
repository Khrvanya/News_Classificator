Banks have come under fire from the Bank of England and the general public for not providing loans to companies fast enough as a national lockdown shutters swathes of an economy heading for deep recession.
But the chief executives of commercial banking at domestic lenders Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland said the primary reason relief lending was faster in countries like Germany and Switzerland was due to 100% state guarantees offered from the onset of the crisis.
Lloyds' David Oldfield said: "The key difference ... is that some of the other European schemes had a 100% government guarantee from Day One.
