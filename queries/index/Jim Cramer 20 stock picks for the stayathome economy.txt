"After another panicked week where doom and gloom dominated the headlines, I want to help you identify stocks that are worth buying into weakness and I think these twenty stay-at-home economy plays" are perfect picks for a potential pandemic, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.
"What works in this difficult environment are companies with products that you can enjoy from the comfort of your home," the "Mad Money" host said.
"COVID-19 didn't create the stay-at-home economy. You know, we've spent years here moving in that direction," he said adding "but this outbreak's pouring fuel on the stay-at-home fire."

Though the outbreak has not been declared a global pandemic, consumers are more likely to stay home and decrease their odds of catching the COVID-19 novel virus, which has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide. That would redirect where and how those individuals spend money, Cramer said.
Numerous business conferences have been canceled and travel plans disrupted, negatively impacting airlines, cruise lines, casinos, hotels and restaurants, he added.
