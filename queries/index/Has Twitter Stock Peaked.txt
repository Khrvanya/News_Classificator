After a 30% rally from 23rd March, we believe Twitter’s stock (NYSE: TWTR) does not have room to grow based on its valuation. Despite this rally, Twitter’s stock has under performed the S&P 500 index over the last three months - with the latter gaining 40%. The recovery was first seen after the Fed’s multi-billion dollar stimulus package, which suppressed near-term survival anxiety. One of the primary reasons the stock saw further rise is that the company’s user base is expanding as users can find real-time news stories and discuss current developments on the platform. In Q1 2020, the company saw average monetizable daily active users increase by 24% y-o-y.
The company has seen steady revenue rise over recent years, but its P/S multiple has remained nearly flat. We believe the stock has not much room to grow after the recent rally and the potential weakness from a recession driven by the Covid outbreak. Our dashboard ’ What Factors Drove 37.1% Change In Twitter Stock Between 2017 And Now? ’ has the underlying numbers.
Some of this rise over the last two years was helped by the 42% rise seen in Twitter’s revenue from 2017 to 2019, while it’s profit increased from -$108 million in 2017 to $1.5 billion in 2019.
