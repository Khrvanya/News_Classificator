New Zealand shares extended yesterday’s gain, following Wall Street's lead overnight and as Fisher & Paykel Healthcare become the NZX’s first $20 billion company.
The S&P/NZX 50 Index rose 198.51 points, or 1.8 percent, to 11,451.05. Within the index, 30 stocks rose, 12 fell, and eight were unchanged. Turnover was $293.4 million.
Investors continued to react to F&P Healthcare’s record result yesterday, driving its share price up 6.3 percent to $35.60 and giving it a market capitalisation of $20.46 billion - the first homegrown listed company to cross the $20 billion threshold.
Yesterday, the medical device maker reported a 37 percent lift in annual profit to $287.3 million and forecast that to rise to between $325 million and $340 million in the March 2021 year.
Sam Trethewey, a portfolio manager at Milford Asset Management, said the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of F&P Healthcare's products and had been extremely well-received.
“They have increased production of some product lines three times in response to covid,” he said.
“I know they have been prioritising product to where it is needed most, not just filling every order, but filling orders that are actually going to patients.”
And, with F&P Healthcare's products only reaching 10 percent of the addressable market, there was still potential for further growth ahead.
The strong performance on the local bourse was underpinned by Wall Street bouncing back from Friday night’s sell off. US investors were again “buying the dip” in hopes of further monetary stimulus supporting the economic recovery.
“The positive lead overnight from Wall Street showed there was still cash out there and people that are willing to put money to work on dips,” Trethewey said.
That upbeat sentiment encouraged investors to buy risker stocks that have been underperforming in recent days as the resurgence of new covid-19 cases dampened moods.
