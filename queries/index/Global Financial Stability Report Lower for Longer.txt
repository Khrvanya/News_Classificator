Chapter 5 assesses global non-US banksâ€™ US dollar funding fragility and provides metrics for monitoring it. The chapter shows that rising US dollar funding costs are associated with financial stress in the home economies of global non-US banks and with cutbacks in the supply of loans to countries that borrow in US dollars. Such negative effects are amplified when US dollar funding is fragile and the share of US dollar assets in total assets is high. Emerging markets borrowing in US dollars are particularly vulnerable to cutbacks in cross-border lending, because their ability to substitute into alternative funds in US dollars or even other currencies is limited. The chapter discusses central bank swap line arrangements as well as international reserves in the home economies of global non-US banks as possible mitigation tools.
