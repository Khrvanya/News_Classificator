Sticks ‘n’ Sushi has been named the UK’s fastest-growing restaurant group in this year’s AlixPartners Growth Company Index.
The list, which ranks non-listed businesses registered in the UK that recorded at least £3m turnover and £1m of profit in their latest accounts, is designed to track the 50 fastest-growing companies in the UK bar, pub and restaurant market, and is compiled in conjunction with Big Hospitality’s sister site MCA ​​.
A new entrant on this year’s list, Copenhagen-founded Sticks ‘n’ Sushi currently has eight venues in the UK and generated a compound annual growth rate of 129.2% over the last three years.
Congratulating Sticks ‘n’ Sushi at the Retailers’ Retailer Awards in London last night (March 27), MCA editor James Wallin said: “[This is] an exciting growth company that prides itself on amazingly high standards and a best-in-class team culture and ethos.
Following on from the recent Market Growth Monitor report ​​, which revealed the number of Thai chain restaurants had more than doubled in the last five years, this year’s Index also saw Giggling Squid and Rosa’s Thai listed in the top 10, registering compound annual growth rates of 65.1% and 48.2% respectively.
Bar group The Alchemist were the highest climbers to register in the top 10, moving 13 places to fifth after recording a growth rate of 54.2%
Commenting on the results, AlixPartners’ managing director Graeme Smith said: “This annual index has become a great proxy for the UK’s very best restaurant, pub and bar companies, because delivering this type of growth consistently is extremely difficult – yet many of the companies in the list are perennial constituents.
“It’s a testament to the very high quality of these businesses, in terms of their appeal to consumers, the standards they consistently execute and the fantastic guest experience they deliver.”
