The Nigerian equities market extended its current losing streak to the fifth consecutive trading session, yesterday, as sell-offs in 22 stocks dragged the index further by 0.38 per cent.
At the close of transactions Wednesday, at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 95.01 absolute points or 0.38 per cent to close at 24,655.05 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation shed N49 billion to close at N12.862 trillion.
The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in large and medium value stocks, amongst which were; Seplat Petroleum Development Company, Guinness Nigeria, Nigerian Breweries,   GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Nigeria, and PZ Cussons Nigeria
Analysts at Afrinvest Limited, said: “Following three consecutive days of sustained profit-taking by investors this week, we do not rule out the possibility of some bargain-hunting in subsequent trading sessions.”
The Chief Research Officer at Investdata Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omodion, said: “Amidst the indecision and unwillingness by traders to buy at this current market value, the bearish wave will persist on pullbacks, creating new entering positions.
“This is as the money flow index continues its downward slant, revealing the exit of smart money, despite flowing from one sector to another seeking value in terms of low prices with high upside potentials.
“Also, sectors that had suffered oversold so far, offer attractive risk-reward buy-opportunities and outlook for considerable short, medium and long term investment. For immediate liquidity or cash let us trade low priced stocks with serious caution to avoid being trapped,” he added.
