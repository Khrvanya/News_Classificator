and globally recognised approach to examining applications in the digital field,
the EPO is well placed to support inventors, and foster innovation in Europe
Among the top technical fields at the EPO, digital communication and computer technology saw the steepest growth, highlighting their key
field, which lies at the intersection of telecommunications and computers,

technology trends were also reflected in the country data. The top five
countries of origin for applications in 2019 were the US, accounting for 25% of
total filings, followed by Germany (15%), Japan (12%), China (7%) and France (6%) (Fig.: Origin of
countries for applications ). In the past decade, patent filings from China with the EPO have
increased nearly sixfold (12 247 applications in 2019 vs. 2 061 in 2010). In 2019, the general upward trend in filings continued from nearly every

applications from Europe continued to slide, however, falling from 51% in 2009 to
45% in 2019, as more players from outside Europe, and especially Asia, seek to protect
their inventions in the European market.
EPO member states developed stably overall, with most firms filing more patent
applications than in 2018. Sweden (+8.0%) was the growth champion, boosted by increases
in applications related to digital communication and computer technology. Patent

US, and one from each of China and Japan.
European countries shows that 72% of them were filed by large companies, 18% by
small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors, and 10% by
universities and public research organisations. This confirms that a
significant proportion of EPO applicants are smaller entities (Fig.: Breakdown of applicants by category ).
