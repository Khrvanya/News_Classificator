The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the most well-known share index in the USA. The Dow Jones was developed by Charles Henry Dow and originally contained just 12 American companies. It was published for the first time in May 1896 and opened at a level of 40.94 points. Today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average consists of the 30 most important market-leading companies on the American stock exchange and reflects their growth.
Like the Swiss Market Index (SMI), the Dow Jones is a price index. The shares included in it are weighted according to price; the index level represents the average of the shares included in it.  Dividend payments are not considered in the index.
The inclusion of a company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average does not depend on defined criteria. Instead, an independent Wall Street Journal commission decides whether a share is to be included or excluded. There are no fixed times for reviewing the composition of the index, since changes are only made by the commission as and when they are needed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is traded on Wall Street each trading day between 3:30 pm and 10:00 pm CET.
