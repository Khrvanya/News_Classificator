Investors are pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of  gains from soaring biotech stocks as the race for coronavirus  drugs intensifies.
Drug developer Moderna spiked 30% between Monday and Tuesday's  trading sessions, beating out a plunging market by shipping the  first coronavirus vaccine for human testing. The firm submitted  vials of mRNA-1273 for phase one trials in the US just 42 days  after identifying the key RNA sequence to target, according to a  Monday press release.
Moderna shares gained 2% on Monday as the broader market slumped  the most in two years. The biotech company soared as much as 43%  in Tuesday's session before paring some gains.
Moderna's stock jump arrived one day after biotech company Gilead  notched a similar uptick. The firm soared as much as 11% Monday  after a World Health Organization official said its remdesivir  compound could be the best bet for treating coronavirus cases.  Gilead's drug is undergoing human trials in China, with results  expected to be released in April.
Here are the top 10 shareholders to ride Moderna's two-day stock  rally, ranked in ascending order of profit. Gain figures are  calculated from the spike between February 21's close and the  closing price on February 25. Holdings data are sourced from  Bloomberg.
