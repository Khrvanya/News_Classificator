A global tally of COVID-19 infections crossed 9.33 million, with Australia recording its biggest one-day rise in COVID-19 cases in two months. The United States posted its second-largest increase in cases since the crisis began.
Focus will also shift towards the earnings performance by companies, an analyst said.
“I think people are starting to realise you’re going to have to start paying attention to earnings and the other existential threats like the virus and stimulus ending” said Brad Smoling, managing director at Smoling Stockbroking.
