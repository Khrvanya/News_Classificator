Nifty’s Index management Sub-committee (IMSC) has announced a rejig of certain NSE indices as part of its periodic review. The reshuffle that will come into effect on June 26 will not see any change in the Nifty 50 index but will see changes in the Nifty Next 50, Nifty 100 , Nifty 500, and sectoral indices. The NSE announced that Nifty Next 50 will see Ashok Leyland Ltd., Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd., L&T Finance Holdings Ltd, New India Assurance Company, and struggling telco Vodafone Idea exit from the index. These will be replaced by Abbott India Ltd, Indraprastha Gas Ltd, Muthoot Finance Ltd, and Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
A change in indices forces mutual funds and exchange trade funds to mirror the moves if they have their portfolios shaped up in a manner that reflects the index and its constituents. Along with Nifty Next 50, the Nifty 500 index will see 25 stocks being tucked out. Kishore Biyani led Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd will also be excluded from the Nifty 500 along with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Capital, Reliance Power, and Reliance Infrastructure. Troubled non-banking finance company Dewan Housing finance has also been shown the door by the IMSC of NSE Indices Limited. Among the 25 stocks that will be replacing the excluded ones, IRCTC is one of the biggest names along with Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd., GMM Pfaudler , Shipping Corporation of India , Sumitomo Chemical India, Tata Communications , and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank .
