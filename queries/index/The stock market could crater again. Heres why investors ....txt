The stock market could crater again. Here's why investors shouldn't worry
The U.S. stock market lost 34% over a month as the pandemic worsened. It was followed by the best 50-day rally in the history of the S&P 500.
A second coronavirus outbreak, failure to pass additional stimulus measures or an unforeseen factor could cause another deep selloff.
Long-term investors should stay the course or risk leaving a lot of money on the table.

The stock market has defied gravity in recent weeks, rebounding nearly as quickly as it sold off amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The threat of another steep decline is omnipresent. But stock investors shouldn't be concerned, experts say.
In fact, panicking and selling out of stocks if the market craters again could cost investors a lot of money.
"When the heat is on and things feel risky and scary, that's where your biggest potential returns are going to lie as a stock market investor," Fitzgerald said.
The S&P 500 , an index measuring the stock performance of the largest public companies in the U.S., fell 34% between mid-February and Mar. 23 as investors grew skittish amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic.
It was the fastest decline of its kind in history.
However, it was followed by the best 50-day rally in the history of the S&P 500.
The stock index is up about 38% from its trough, within reach of fully erasing its recent losses. (Breaking even requires a larger percentage gain than the prior percentage decline.)
During that period, the market seemingly defied the onslaught of negative economic news, as millions of Americans filing for unemployment benefits every week, for example.
This demonstrates the near impossibility of timing the market, experts said.
