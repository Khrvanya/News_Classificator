The 2019 Disability Equality Index (DEI) list of top-scoring companies , or “Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion,” will be announced at the Disability:IN Annual Conference & Expo. 156 companies, scoring 80 and above, will be recognized by Ted Kennedy, Jr., board chair of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) on stage among 2,000 industry peers. The DEI serves as the most comprehensive benchmarking tool for disability inclusion and is a joint initiative between AAPD and Disability:IN.
The DEI continuously evolves to encourage companies to advance inclusion across the enterprise. Scores are on a scale from 0 to 100. A score of 100 does not mean to convey “perfection.” AAPD and Disability:IN recognize there is no one “right” way to practice inclusion, and that some practices may be more practical for some companies or industries than others. A score of 100 on the DEI simply means that a company adheres to many of the numerous leading disability inclusion practices featured in the DEI. The benchmarking tool was developed in consultation with the appointed DEI Advisory Committee , a diverse and voluntary group of experts in disability advocacy, business, and policy.
Participating industries include financial services, technology, insurance, and health care. Participating companies in the 2019 DEI represent a total U.S. workforce of 8,693,591. The announcement of top-scoring companies come on the heels of a joint investor statement from 17 investors, representing $2.1 trillion, who have called on companies to be inclusive to people with disabilities.
AAPD and Disability:IN are honored to recognize the following DEI top-scoring companies:
