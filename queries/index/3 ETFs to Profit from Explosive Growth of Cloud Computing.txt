Cloud is fast emerging as the new model of computing in the technology industry. Many companies now prefer to rely on cloud based service providers for highly specialized computing services so that they can focus on their core businesses.

It also provides firms a lot of flexibility and agility in scaling up or down their computing capacity according to business needs.
