Dow slumps at Thursday's open, but Nasdaq briefly pops higher, as stocks attempt recovery from worst decline in nearly 2 weeks
U.S. stocks benchmarks slipped slightly at Thursday's open, but technology-related stocks were still getting bought, as the main indexes looked to recover from the worst one-day skid in about two weeks on Wednesday, amid growing signs that the daily count of new COVID-19 cases is accelerating, snarling efforts to reopen businesses in several states and threatening the economy's recovery. Investors digested an array of data including a labor-market report that showed that Americans filed 1.48 million new jobless claims in the week ended June 20, fewer than in the previous week, but more than the 1.38 million forecast in a MarketWatch survey. Separately, the final reading of first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the health of the U.S. economy, showed that the economy contracted at an annualized pace of 5%. And a report on orders for long-lasting, or durable, goods, showed they rose 15.8% in May.
