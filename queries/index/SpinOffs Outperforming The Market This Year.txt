Why do spin-offs outstrip the market? Spins benefit from greater management focus and accountability as stand-alone public companies (versus when they were part of larger enterprises). The rational for spin-offs varies. Some companies wish to get rid of a weak or low-margin division that is detracting attention from the parent. Other companies seek to highlight the attributes of a desirable unit whose full value may not be reflected in the parent’s stock price. There also is pressure on managements from the growing number of activist investors, whose prescription for a lagging stock often is a breakup.

I have published “Spin-Off Research”, an institutional advisory report featuring analysis on spin-offs since March, 1997. Spin-Offs often result in higher aggregate value for the constituent pieces. Many diversified companies are electing to spin-off parts of their business finding they can create significant value for shareholders.
