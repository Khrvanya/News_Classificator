Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities:
Today's rally was based on domestic news flows especially, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the annual session of CII gave confidence to Corporates that completely changed the picture of the market. Bajaj twins, HDFC twins and a few other private banks closed higher. Technically, Nifty is at the resistance level and support exists within the range of 9800 and 9600 levels.
The short term trend of Nifty continues to be positive. A sustainable move above 10K mark is expected to pull the market towards next upside region of 10,500 in the next 1-2 weeks. Unable to move above 10,000 levels is likely to trigger downward correction from the highs. Immediate support is placed at 9865.
Technically the Nifty has made a higher top after making a higher bottom on May 18. It could now after a brief consolidation/correction rise towards 10295-10334. On falls 9824-9889 could offer support.
Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities:
Index closed a day near a crucial zone of 10k mark with gains of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday session, index formed a bullish candle for fifth consecutive day. Current chart structure suggesting we may see a decisive break above 10k mark in coming session and if we managed to sustain above 10k mark then we may see next move towards 10500 zone in near term.
Support for Nifty is coming near 9900-9800 zone and resistance is coming near 10100-10200 zone. Nifty Bank closed a day at 20616 with gains of more than 3 percent, support for Nifty Bank is coming near 20225-20000 zone and resistance is coming near 20866-21100 zone.
The benchmark has gained over nine percent in the last five sessions and trying to be in sync with global peers. We may see some consolidation or profit-taking ahead, citing critical hurdle around 10,050 zone however the buoyancy in banking would help the index maintaining a positive tone. We reiterate our advice focusing on stock selection.
Vinod Nair- Head of Research- Geojit Financial Services:
Indian markets shrugged off news regarding Moodyâ€™s credit rating downgrade, which was trumped by the expectation of the economy opening up. The government has again reiterated its commitment to continued reforms to strengthen the economy. The uptrend in most major sectoral indices continued while the broader markets have also participated. Inspite of many possible negative triggers, positive sentiment still drives the markets and would advise to stick to quality stocks.
Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments:
The Nifty Index respected the levels of 9900 and kept above it the entire day. This is a positive indication. We are now close to the 10,000 level. 10050 is a target to trade for. Thereafter, one could initiate a buy on all dips for targets closer to 10100-10200.
S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities:
Bulls continued to charge from where they left yesterday on the back of Bajaj Twins, Kotak Bank & HDFC as the Nifty powered its way closer to the 10k mark today. The rural rally of yesterday continued with broader participation from the likes of Mahindra Finance, Cholamandalam, VST Tillers & Bajaj Electricals.
