India VIX moved up by 0.51 percent from 29.57 to 29.73 levels.
After opening lower at 10,235.55, the Nifty hit an intraday low of 10,194.50 and a high of 10,361.80 amid volatility. The index settled at 10,288.90, down 16.40 points.
"Lack of follow through sell-off with a rangebound move of 167 points on expiry session in the Nifty is suggesting that Wednesday's sell-off can be just a reaction to the global cues. Hence, if the bulls manages to defend today's low of 10,194 in the next trading session, then a sideways move with an initial target of 10,361 can be expected. If that hurdle is cleared, the strength can get extended into the zone of 10,406–10,463 levels," Mohammad said.
A trend reversal in favour of the bulls should not be expected unless the Nifty closes above 10,553 levels, he said.
If the Nifty breaks 10,194, then it will confirm weakness in the trend and will initially drag the index towards 10,050, Mohammad said.
