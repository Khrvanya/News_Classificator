Deutsche Bank report on 'Maximum Containment, Social Distancing & the Economics of Stoppage'
An unexpected convergence of multiple exogenous forces in 2020 will likely lead to a severe global recession in the 1H 2020, said Deutsche Bank. The report added, "COVID-19 virus is quickly becoming the greatest global health pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918."
It added that while China, Singapore, HK, Taiwan and South Korea flattened their curves through vigilant monitoring and early intervention, cases across Europe and the US are rising rapidly, with US data resembling that of Italy from one week ago.
The report further notes that global market volatility in March has risen to levels seen only three times previously over the last 8 century (2008, 1987, 1929) and added that the scale of global de-risking and fear has led to broad-based selling across virtually all asset classes.
Vigilant monitoring, testing and social distancing have become critical to an effective public policy response. Although a wave of layoffs, missed rental payments and bankruptcies are likely to follow. The speed and precision required to 'bridge' millions of SMEs globally will be very difficult to execute, it further noted.

Speaking over the 21 days lock down and its impact on the financial markets, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services sauid,"Enforcement of the  21 day lock out of the nation will be a major challenge. Ensuring supplies to all households is not going to be easy, but has to be done. The temporary shock to the economy will be huge. But if we come out of this lockdown successfully, economic recovery can be sharp.The choice in this crisis is limited. That's why the PM said, if we don't do this 21 day lockdown, we will go back to 21 years. Effective practical enforcement of the lockdown will require massive support from the central govt including income support to poor households, foreberance on NPA classification, EMI repayment etc. This will come, as the FM said earlier in the AN, sooner than later."
