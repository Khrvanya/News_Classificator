Forming a “rounding base,” the pullback found support at its former “trendline resistance” at 30. Once the VIX closes above 46, then it would confirm an advance to 55-60.
      or RVX, has the potential to advance at least as much as the VIX. The weekly chart shows a dramatic breakout from a four-year base. A simple three-step correction held perfectly at what had been resistance since early 2016. Here too, the RVX is in the late stages of completing a rounding base. Once it closes above 58, then it would confirm an advance to 75-80 (and potentially back to its 89 high).
      or VXN, has also formed a rounding base. Closing above 42 would complete its advance and project an advance to 55.
This should not come as a surprise. Many of the fastest-growing states in population are experiencing a dramatic increase in Covid-19 cases —with many posting their largest daily increases to date. This suggests that we are still in the initial wave of infections. It would be a bearish sign if stocks don’t advance despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive growth in its balance sheet.
With the presidential election in less than five months, this summer promises not to be a dull one.
