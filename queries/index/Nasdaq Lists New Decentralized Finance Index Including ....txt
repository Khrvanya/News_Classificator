Nasdaq Lists New Decentralized Finance Index Including MakerDao, 0x, Augur
Nasdaq has added a new index that aims to offer the markets information on blockchain projects working in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.
Called Defix, the index was launched by the London-based Exante brokerage – an early mover in the crypto industry that launched a bitcoin fund in 2012. Offered as a means for investors and traders to track “popular” defi-focused blockchain tokens, Defix lists projects including MakerDao, Augur, Gnosis, Numerai, 0x and Amoveo.
The index is listed by NASDAQ under the ticker DEFX, and can also be tracked on TradingView and Google, with a listing on Yahoo Finance planned in the future.
The news marks the latest index to be added by Nasdaq to inform its users. This year so far, the U.S. stock exchange has added dedicated indices for bitcoin, ether and XRP ,  as well as a wider crypto reference index from CryptoCompare .
This autumn, Exante is also to launch a fund based on the Defix index, saying it will be offered through a “secure, financially accredited agency.”
The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies . CoinDesk is an independent operating subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain startups.
