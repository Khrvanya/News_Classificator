Australian shares are expected to start a shortened week lower after the coronavirus outbreak struck futures markets, putting investors on notice for large falls in Asian equities when regional markets return to trading from the lunar new year holiday.
In limited activity on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Index fell 1.96 per cent to 23,361 points and Wall Street was on track for a decline of 0.99 per cent for the S&P 500, and 1.3 per cent for the Nasdaq.
Futures for China's CSI 300 and CSI 500 indices warned of worse to come, down 3.6 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively. Neither index is scheduled to trade until Friday, but Beijing has since extended the public holiday period to Sunday, and it's still unclear if this also applies to the market. Hong Kong's Hang Seng will resume on Wednesday.
The coronavirus has caused 80 deaths and China has recorded more than 2,000 infections as of Sunday's official state update , raising alarms of a possible global pandemic if the strain of virus, which can cause pneumonia, cannot be contained. It is not yet a global health emergency as defined by the World Heath Organization, although cases have been confirmed outside China, including in Australia.
Currency markets were active, lifting the yen in a classic safe-haven tilt and causing the Australian dollar to soften. The local currency was buying US68.02Â¢, its lowest level in four weeks, and the offshore-traded Chinese renminbi was fetching 6.9676 to the US dollar, representing a fall of around 0.5 per cent.
Crude oil has also been vulnerable to coronavirus reports, mirroring its performance during the SARS outbreak of 2003 which limited travel and retail activity. Coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, which has been placed in a transport lockdown since Thursday, a measure since extended to neighbouring cities .
Oil futures fell for a fifth straight day, to $US52.89 a barrel, down 2.4 per cent on Monday.
"That coronavirus is seen as potentially affecting economic growth hence the impact on financial markets," said Imre Speizer, market strategist at Westpac New Zealand.
Global growth expectations have benefited from a stabilisation of China's economic activity, the latest data showed. December's industrial production beat expectations, even though China's GDP expanded by 6.1 per cent in 2019, the slowest annual growth rate for three decades.
According to the International Monetary Fund, global growth will accelerate from 2.9 per cent in 2019 to 3.3 per cent in 2020, emboldened by the US and China reaching their phase one trade deal (and reducing the anticipated drag from imposed tariffs), a clear path to Brexit, and ongoing monetary stimulus in the form of low rates.
Transport stocks have already been sold off, including airports and airlines. Last week, shares of Qantas lost 6.15 per cent to $6.71, Sydney Airport 6.75 per cent to $8.43, and travel agents Helloworld Travel 5.73 per cent to $4.61, Flight Centre 5.43 per cent to $41.47 and Corporate Travel 8.85 per cent to $20.19.
Air New Zealand declined 2 per cent to $NZ2.92 on Monday on New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 Index, which was down 0.4 per cent for the session. Auckland International Airport fell 1.6 per cent to $NZ8.74 and SkyCity Entertainment almost 2 per cent to $NZ3.99.
In currencies, the Japanese yen advanced 0.3 per cent against the US dollar for a five-day gain of 1.09 per cent, making it the best performing group of 10 currency. The Australian dollar is down 0.95 per cent against the greenback over the same period.
Australian shares added 0.4 per cent last week despite the outbreak, extending this year's gains to 6.1 per cent based on the market's 7090.5 closing level.
