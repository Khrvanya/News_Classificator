Taipei, March 13 (CNA) Shares in Taiwan closed lower but recouped a large part of their earlier losses Friday on bargain hunting to return to the 10,000-point mark, while investors remained wary of the global spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, dealers said.
Bargain hunters turned active after the main board fell below 10,000 points and moved closer to 9,600 points, rushing to pick up battered large-cap tech stocks, in particular in the Apple Inc. supply chain, while the petrochemical sector underperformed the broader market in the wake of falling international crude oil prices, the dealers said.
The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE), or Taiex, ended down 293.45 points, or 2.82 percent, at 10,128.87, after moving between 9,636.15 and 10,171.20, on turnover of NT$302.18 billion (US$10.01 billion).
The market opened down 3.17 percent in a knee-jerk reaction to the heavy losses on U.S. markets, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,352 points, or almost 10 percent, the highest single-session drop since Oct. 19, 1987, and the broader S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index also fell more than 9 percent overnight, the dealers said.
The plunge of the U.S. markets Thursday came after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic at a time when confirmed cases worldwide were continuing to rise.
The weakness on the local main board continued to push down the Taiex to the day's low, which was closer to 9,600 points, prompting some investors to shift to the buy side, in particular in the late trading session, to take advantage of the relatively low valuations after the earlier sell-off, which helped the main board return to the 10,000-point level by the end of the session, the dealers added.
"The late-session interest showed that many investors had a consensus that a buying opportunity on the battered local main board has emerged and their participation boosted today's turnover to top the huge NT$300 billion level," Mega International Investment Services Corp. analyst Alex Huang said.
"I think among the active bargain hunters were government-led funds in a bid to limit the downturn and eventually bolster investor confidence in the local equity market for the moment," Huang said.
He said bargain-hunting focused on large-cap Apple concept stocks to lift the entire electronics sector, which dominated the main board throughout the trading session.
"The contagion is likely to hurt consumption for now, but after the virus spread slows down, the tech industry could benefit from deferred purchases," Huang said.
Among the suppliers to Apple, contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the most heavily weighted stock in the local market, fell 1.36 percent to close at NT$290.00 after coming off a low of NT$272.50 with 149.74 million shares changing hands.
After hitting a low of NT$69.90, iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., second only to TSMC in terms of market capitalization, lost 0.13 percent to close at NT$74.60, while smartphone camera maker Largan Precision Co. gained 2.01 percent to end at NT$4,060.00 after coming off a low of NT$3,620.00, and contract notebook computer producer Quanta Computer Inc. closed up 3.06 percent at NT$60.60, off a low of NT$54.50.
Riding the wave of bargain hunting, the electronics sector ended at 447.45, off a low of 423.12, down 1.96 percent.
The hard-hit financial sector also got a boost from bargain hunting to recover some of its earlier losses, with Yuanta Financial Holding Co. down 0.57 percent to close at NT$17.40, off a low of NT$16.00, and Mega Financial Holding Co., down 0.66 percent to end at NT$30.00 after hitting a low of NT$28.05.
The petrochemical sector underperformed the broader market amid concern over a plunge in crude oil prices, the dealers said. In the sector, Formosa Petrochemical Corp. fell 5.45 percent to close at NT$72.90, Formosa Plastics Corp. lost 4.05 percent to end at NT$80.60, Nan Ya Plastics Corp. dropped 3.76 percent to close at NT$61.40 and Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. lost 3.73 percent to end at NT$72.30.
"Despite the latest bargain hunting, the local equity market is still dictated by the performance of the global markets, as the virus spreading in the United States and Europe shows no signs of easing," Huang said.
"If there is any technical rebound, the Taiex could see stiff technical resistance ahead of 10,300 points," Huang said.
According to the TWSE, foreign institutional investors sold a net NT$30.23 billion-worth of shares on the main board Friday after a net sell of NT$36.82 billion a session earlier.
