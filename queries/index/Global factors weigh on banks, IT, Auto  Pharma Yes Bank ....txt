The Sensex closed 62.45 points higher at 35,697.40, while Nifty was up 6.90 points at 10,458.40.
“Markets have witnessed massive volatility in the last few trading sessions. Expect range bound movement for the next few weeks before the markets decides its further course. We believe the index has strong long term support at 10,000-10,100 levels and the same should be held for the medium term. Investors can consider buying heavy weights which are available at attractive valuations," Sahaj Agrawal, Head of Research- Derivatives at Kotak Securities said.
"Though early to call but this is encouraging action from markets perspective. If Nifty closes for another session in the green with a strong close then the recovery trade is likely to play out. Near term resistance zone is placed between 10,650-10,800 zone on the way up. 10,300 is the immediate support zone on the downside," Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Securities said.
It could just be pause after the sharp slide and need support from the global markets for further bounce however it seems difficult at present, citing the rising figures of fresh coronavirus cases worldwide. We advise limiting leveraged positions and preferring hedged bets. Investors, on the other hand, may continue with buying in fundamentally sound counters in a staggered manner.
