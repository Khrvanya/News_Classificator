U.S. stock index futures were little changed late Thursday, after the Federal Reserve announced the results of its latest stress tests. As of midnight Eastern, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures  were down around 60 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures  and Nasdaq-100 futures  were about flat. After the market closed, the Fed announced moves to preserve banks' capital and said it will proceed on a quarter-by-quarter basis amid the uncertainty of the economic downturn. The Fed's stress tests found all major banks remain well-capitalized. A day after an ugly selloff, Wall Street closed solidly higher Thursday amid new worries about rising coronavirus cases in many states. The Dow  rose 299.66 points, 1.2%, to close at 25,745.60 in up-and-down trading, while the S&P 500 index  gained 33.43 points, or 1.1%, to 3,083,76. and the Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 107.84 points, or 1.1%, to 10,017.
