Dow Jones futures retreated 0.3% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures fell 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures just edged lower. DJIA futures closed as of 1 p.m. ET Friday. They resume trading at 6 p.m. ET Sunday. Dow Jones futures trading was relatively muted with U.S. stock exchanges closed Friday, in observance of the Fourth of July holiday. But stock markets in Asia, Europe and elsewhere were open.
Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.
Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 11.19 million. Covid-19 deaths have reached 529,000.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have exceeded 2.89 million, with deaths above 132,000. New coronavirus cases in the U.S. hit  a record 57,232 on Thursday. New U.S. Covid-19 cases nearly hit 55,000 on Friday, the third straight day above 50,000.
Testing has continued to soar, topping 700,000 on Friday. Even so, the share of positive tests is rising, especially in the South and West.
Florida reported more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, followed by over 9,000 on Friday. California topped 9,000 on Thursday while Texas issued a statewide order requiring face coverings.
Hospitalizations have increased in many Sun Belt and Southern states. But, so far coronavirus deaths have remained low nationwide. Recent coronavirus cases have skewed much younger than a few months ago, while standard of care has improved.
Late Thursday. Regeneron and French drug giant Sanofi said a phase 3 trial of Kevzara failed to meet goals in coronavirus patients requiring ventilation. Regeneron stock fell 2% and Sanofi stock 3% in extended trade. REGN stock had closed slightly below a quasi- ascending base entry. SNY stock was just below a consolidation buy point.
The coronavirus stock market rally had a strong start Thursday, with the Nasdaq running to a record high. But the major indexes faded into the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4% in Thursday's stock market trading after hitting resistance once again at its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 index rose 0.45% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%.
But the Dow Jones and other indexes still had a strong week. The DJIA climbed 3.25%, the S&P 500 4% and the Nasdaq 4.6%.
Among the best ETFs , the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ( FFTY ) edged up 0.3% on Thursday but 3.6% for the week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ) climbed 0.2% on Thursday, 3.7% for the week. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ( SMH ) popped 1.5% on Thursday and 3.8% for the week.

Akamai stock jumped 6.4% to 113.12 on Thursday, breaking out past a 108.35 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis . AKAM is just within the 5% chase zone. The relative strength line for Akamai stock still is a little ways from its March peak. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is the blue line in the charts provided.
TSM stock rose 3.2% to 58.62, clearing a 58.14 cup-with-handle buy point. However, the RS line for Taiwan Semiconductor stock is still not at highs. Taiwan Semi hasn't been a huge winner in recent years, and has lagged several other top chip stocks.
Teladoc stock rose 5.05% to 208.89, just clearing a 208.73 buy point above a high-ish handle from a recent consolidation. TDOC stock also moved past a very short trend line offering an early entry around 200. The RS line for Teladoc stock is near a record high after a huge run to start the year.
Atlassian stock climbed 2.4% to 190.08 on Thursday, a record close. TEAM stock is just below a 191.82 flat-base buy point. But investors could have bought Atlassian stock as it got to around 188, clearing a short-term high as well as a downward-sloping trend line. In recent weeks, TEAM stock has found support at its 10-week line.
Tesla stock surged 8.4% to 1,208.66, hitting yet another-record high. Before Thursday, Tesla reported it delivered 90,650 electric vehicles in the second quarter. That beat recent estimates of around 88,000. Model 3 and Y deliveries were 80,050, while Model S and X deliveries were 10,600. Overall production from the Fremont and Shanghai plants was 82,272.
TSLA stock had already been soaring earlier in the week as leaked Elon Musk emails to staff signaled Tesla was close to breaking even in the second quarter. If Tesla earnings are positive for Q2, that could spur TSLA stock's entry into the S&P 500 index. Musk likely can recognize sufficient emission credits and "Full Self Driving" revenue to make that happen.
With investors pricing in strong deliveries and more, Tesla stock skyrocketed 26% for the week.
It was a huge week for EV-related plays. Nio stock leapt 36% to a 16-month high, including a 19% spike on Thursday. The Chinese luxury electric SUV maker reported record Q2 deliveries early Thursday. Workhorse Group ( WKHS ), which is developing electric vans, shot up 111% this past week after a 103% advance in the prior week. Blink Charging ( BLNK ) leapt 75%.
Late Thursday, TSLA stock rose a fraction. Nio stock rallied 3%.
For the next few weeks, investors will await Tesla earnings and possible S&P 500 admission news for TSLA stock.
As for the business, Tesla should be producing record amounts, with no coronavirus shutdowns affecting either the Fremont or Shanghai factories. Overall production should be well over 100,000 in the third quarter. Tesla will begin to answer key questions about ongoing demand for the Model Y, Europe and China, but short-term factors still weighed to the upside.
After the initial burst of Tesla Model Y orders, will the new EV show sustained demand, especially given widespread reports of poor build quality? If demand wanes, Tesla presumably could introduce a lower-cost variant to the Model Y, cut prices, or begin Y shipments to Europe.
Tesla's EV market share in Europe appeared to have peaked before the coronavirus crisis. There might be some pent-up demand in Q3, while European subsidies are increasing. But several more EV and hybrid rivals are rolling out.
Musk might also send more Fremont cars to Asia outside of China, notably South Korea, home to the world's juiciest EV subsidies right now.
As for China, Tesla presumably had strong June sales for its new made-in-China Model 3 LR, especially with subsidies being cut in July. What is the sustained demand for the Model 3 in China? EV competition is picking up there as well.
