This idea has been given life by the recent reversal higher.
And it’s even more noteworthy when its a market leader.
Here’s a more detailed insight:  When price holds the “blue wave-4 channel” as indicated in the chart, there are improved statistical odds for a strong wave 5 rally.
Should the rally see follow-through buying, it could see our MFU-4 price target at 11280.
Leave this field empty if you're human:
I would also note that the S&P 500 went slightly below its wave-4 blue channel and is now above it, which is positive.
