Mumbai: SGX Nifty indicates a flat start for Thursday morning on mixed global cues. The two benchmark Indian indices Nifty & Sensex are likely to open and hover around the flatline today as the global handover saw barely any movement from the previous day's levels. Positive vaccine news could propel local markets higher as Pfizer seems to be on the cusp of a vaccine in the US. However, on the flip side, a domestic surge in cases coupled with possible lockdown extension in certain states could harm sentiment.
The Dow lagged on Wednesday with a modest loss. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained during the session, with the NASDAQ jumping more than 1% to an all-time high. Traders accredited Wednesday’s gains to optimism over a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. All three major indexes are on track for sizable weekly gains. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite are up 3.5%, 2.8% and 4%, respectively.

OIL - US crude stockpile drawn down significantly, manufacturing activity picks up in June, prices gain
Oil prices rose about 1% on Wednesday. This was due to a heavy a drawdown in US crude inventories from record highs. US crude inventories fell more than expected, by 7.2 million barrels last week. A string of positive manufacturing data also fuelled prices. However, a surge in COVID cases muted gains. Brent crude rose 67 cents, or 1.5%, to $41.90 a barrel. WTI crude rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to $39.73 a barrel
Gold dropped from a near 8-year high on Wednesday. Equities were the preferred asset class and gained smartly on the back of encouraging US manufacturing data and positive COVID-19 vaccine news. Spot gold fell 0.6% to $1,770.57 per ounce, having earlier hit a peak since October 2012 at $1788.9. US gold futures settled down 1.1%, at $1,779.90. Undoubtedly, bullion continues to remain the preferred pick among all asset classes during these turbulent times.
