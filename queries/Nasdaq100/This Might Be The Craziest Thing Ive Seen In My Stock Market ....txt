Typically, when recession hits and unemployment rises dramatically, it's not good for the stock market as both revenues and earnings take a hit.
In the past, the trends in continued jobless claims and stocks had a negative correlation, meaning that when the former rose the latter fell.

Typically, when recession hits and unemployment rises dramatically, it's not good for the stock market as both revenues and earnings take a hit.

Over the past few months, however, we have seen both rise strongly in tandem. And there may be no better representation of the massive gulf between the stock market and the economy right now.
