The Brazilian government has said that it is rejecting an offer of financial aid from G7 countries to help tackle a record number of wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest. Two industries are being blamed for their contribution to the infernos - beef and soy. Brazil is the world's largest beef exporter and it's expected to ship 2.2 million metric tons of it overseas in 2019. It's also the world's largest soy producer and the growth of both industries have come at the expense of the country's rainforest.
The current spate of fires is being blamed on the accelerated pace of deforestation, primarily for cattle ranching and soy production. Fire is used to dispose of felled trees and dried vegetation while it is also used by farmers to clear and maintain areas for agricultural use. Back in the early 1980s, Brazil's soybean harvest totaled around 14 million metric tons and the crop quickly boomed due to development of new cultivation techniques as well as the use of pesticides. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is now projecting a 123 million ton harvest for 2019/20 which would make Brazil the world's leading soy producer ahead of the United States.
The continuing drive for new pastures for cattle grazing, more land for soybean cultivation and the ensuing wildfires could all combine to have profound implications for the planet. The Brazilian rainforest is home to some three million species of plants and animals and it plays a crucial role in regulating global warming, absorbing millions of tons of carbon emissions every year. Website Mongabay states that over 792,000 km2 of Brazilian rainforest has been lost since 1970 and if this trend continues, it may prove impossible to keep global warming at manageable levels.
