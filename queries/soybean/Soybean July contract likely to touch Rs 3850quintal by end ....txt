CBOT soya complex was up significantly and its impact was observed in domestic market also, but near term upside will be limited
Agri markets recovered from the early fall in prices as the IMD declared Monsoon to have covered the entire country on June 26. The normal date for Southwest Monsoon to cover the entire country is July 8 â€“ as per its statement. Therefore, the Southwest Monsoon this year has covered the entire country 12 days prior to the normal date.
This news was bearish for the agri commodity prices. Kharif crop sowing generally starts after the initial showers. Any early arrival of Monsoon rains is good for the crop sowing, its sowing area, the overall productivity and ultimately, generally leads to better production prospects. Though the overall crop production would depend on the rains during the entire Monsoon season.
Prices, however, started recovering from the middle of the week. As mentioned in our earlier report that any bearish news would have limited impact on the prices. Most agri prices have already fallen a lot over the last few months since the COVID-19 season started. Further major fall in prices may be unsustainable. Finally, as of now, even as Monsoon covers the entire Indian sub-continent, the overall rains in the critical areas of North-West and Central India still show some deficiency in many areas.
