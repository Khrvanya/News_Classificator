Newly-listed food and beverage kiosk operator Fruitas Holdings Inc. has signed a deal to acquire two new food brands: The Tofu Store and Filipino cuisine stall operator Kuxina.
“Our 18th year in the kiosk business is a testament of our ability to innovate and identify suitable additions to our portfolio, unified by our vision to be woven into the fabric of daily lives of Filipinos. We will further strengthen our existing brands and seamlessly integrate our latest acquisitions, broadening our offerings to include both traditional and contemporary Filipino food and drinks,” Fruitas president and chief executive officer Lester Yu said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday.
Fruitas acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of SoyKingdom Inc., the privately-held corporation carrying The Tofu Store brand and specializing in soybean-related products.
The acquisition of Kuxina, on the other hand, was made through Fruitas’ subsidiary, Negril Trading Inc., operator of De Original Jamaican Pattie Shop and Juice Bar.
