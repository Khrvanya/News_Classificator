Why Are U.S. Taxpayers Providing Public Pensions To Millionaire Members Of Congress?
Only the October and November totals in 2018 ranked below those in 2019 over the last decade.
November of 2019 ranked 31st and October 2019 ranked 56th over the last 120 months for total value ... [+] of U.S. soybean exports to China. Those are the lowest two rankings for those two critical months with the exception of in 2018.
October and November are the two most important months for U.S. soybean exports. Over the last decade — 120 months — the top 13 months are all either Octobers or Novembers. Three of the top four monthly totals were registered in November 2013, 2014 and 2016.
Why the trade war is such a painful blow to U.S. soybean farmers is that as recently as 2016, China accounted for more than 60% of their exports. That was in a year when exports topped $14.02 billion.
In 2018 — the year that U.S. exports plummeted to zero in November (as well as in September), that percentage collapsed to 18.17%. Exports totaled just $3.12 billion.
Through November of 2019 — annual figures are released next month — those numbers are improved ($7.05 billion and 42.19%) but still well off previous highs.
Brazil, whose growing season is opposite the United States’ since it is in the Southern Hemisphere, is now the world’s leading soybean exporter.
U.S. soybean exports, which fell more than 70% in 2018 from 2017, recovered in 2019 but remained down more than 34% from that 2017 total.

I didn’t leave the womb thinking I would find my life’s work writing and speaking about trade data, trying to make it interesting and relevant. But this is where I find myself. Today, the company I founded in 1998, WorldCity, has published annual TradeNumbers publications around the country, from Seattle to Miami, Los Angeles to New York and numerous points in between. Monthly, we upload more than 10 million pages and page views of Census data at ustradenumbers.com, on hundreds of airports, seaports, countries, and export and import commodities. I serve on the Federal Reserve’s Trade and Transportation Advisory Council. In the last year or so, I have spoken about trade in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Laredo, Miami and Chicago. I also post a weekly Trade Matters video. I don’t expect you to fawn over it like I do, but I hope I bring a little clarity, a different perspective or some insights that are helpful.
