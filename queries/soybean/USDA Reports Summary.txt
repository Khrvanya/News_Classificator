OMAHA (DTN) -- USDA expects the nation's corn farmers to harvest 13.67 billion bushels (bb) of corn this year, pulling in a national average yield of 167 bushels per acre (bpa). That's a decline of 100 million bushels (mb) and 1.4 bpa from last month, respectively, and within the range of pre-report expectations.
Soybean production, at 3.55 bb, was down slightly from last month, with the national average yield estimate 46.9 bpa, unchanged from last month.
Friday's new U.S. ending stocks estimates were bearish for corn, slightly bearish for soybeans and slightly bullish for wheat, while the 2019-20 world ending stocks estimates were bullish for corn, neutral for soybeans and bearish for wheat.

With the national average yield at 167 bpa and corn production at 13.66 bb, USDA's supply forecast declined correspondingly, but the 2019-20 ending stocks did not.
For the 2019-20 marketing year, USDA pegged domestic ending stocks at 1.91 bb, down from 1.93 bb last month. USDA lowered its forecast for use in the feed and residual and ethanol categories by 25 mb each while cutting its export forecast by 50 mb.
The national average farm gate price increased a nickel to $3.85.
Global ending stocks for 2019-20 declined to 296 million metric tons, down 6.5 mmt, due to lower production forecasts.

Yield also held pat for soybeans at 46.9 bpa. Soybean yields for the year are about 4 bushels below 2018's yield of 50.6 bpa. Harvested acres were held pat at 75.6 million acres as well, the same as the October report.
