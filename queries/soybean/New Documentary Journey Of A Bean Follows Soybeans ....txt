Freshly harvested from cropland in Illinois, a single soy bean travels the world before ending up as part of a meal in Seoul, South Korea. Its long journey through the global agricultural and food industries paints a detailed picture of the real farm to table processes.
In this edition of Talk of Iowa, David Geiger, agriculture journalist, documentary filmmaker, and host of the Agribusiness Report , joins host Charity Nebbe to explain his new documentary, "Journey of a Bean." The documentary is now streaming on YouTube.
Geiger says he observed the beans as they were produced into a fermented soybean paste, called cheonggukjang, in South Korea. He ended up trying a dish, doenjang soup, with the paste courtesy of his Airbnb host.
"When we as Americans go get our food, we don't think of it as coming from a farm in a lot of ways - we think of it as coming from the store," Geiger says. "There's so much more of a process when it comes to how that happens in other countries that don't have the same food options as we do."
