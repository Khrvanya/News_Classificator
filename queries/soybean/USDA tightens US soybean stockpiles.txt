Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, sees no surprises in today’s USDA data.
“No surprises and very few changes were made in February’s USDA Crop Report from the January numbers. The corn exports were lowered slightly and ethanol usage was increased, which offset. And the February corn carryover at 1.892 bln was left unchanged from last month. The soybean exports were increased 50 mln, which lowered the ending stocks from 475 million to 425 million, which will be price supportive as South America becomes less competitive,” Roose says.
Sal Gilbert, Teucrium trading, says that this report was basically a nonevent.
“The exception is that the soybean exports were raised, even though no expectations of Chinese purchases related to the tariff war resolution were included in today’s estimates,” Gilbert says.
He added, “U.S. soybean exports to date have been strong, and most expectations are that when China finally steps in, domestic stocks could continue tightening, which is likely why the USDA continues to cautiously lower soybean ending stocks. All eyes will be on Chinese demand and South American weather for the foreseeable future.”
Jason Ward, Northstar Commodity managing director, says that the USDA made one change to the balance sheet and it was an increase of 50 million bushels in the export category to 1.825 bil/bu, or a weekly average of 20.32 mil/bu.
“This is clearly an estimate by WASDE of increased Chinese demand in the coming months, in our view not on current demand, because frankly through the end of May, Brazilian soybeans are likely to remain cheaper than U.S. soy. But this was their target change today,” Ward says.
Ward added, “We have no disagreements with the reports today, but expect to continue to see usage adjustments going forward in the corn in feed/residual and corn used for ethanol to account for lower test weight corn. At the same time, lower exports this month shouldn’t be a huge surprise.”
Greg Lumsden, product line leader for Cargill MarketGuide, says that today’s report was largely a nonevent.
“On corn we saw a 50 million reduction to exports but an offsetting increase of ethanol by the same amount. Net-net the corn carry was left unchanged leaving corn to grind in its recent $3.70-$3.90 price range,” Lumsden says.
Lumsden added, “With South American time frame winding down, our spring months away, and no sign of Chinese buying, the market feels content to bide its time and stay in a low volatility channel for the foreseeable future. An uptick in seasonal demand led by Chinese buying could spark the market, especially with the funds positioned short, but it would be met by heavy producer selling and be capped at 10¢ to 20¢.”
Regarding the soybean market, given the market reaction, today, the market still feels skeptical of the USDA’s increase in demand, Lumsden says.
“Much like corn, if we do in fact see some actual Chinese buying, we could see a break from the recent bearish trend and a modest rally,” Lumsden says.
