The CME Group and Brazilian stock exchange B3 S.A. are teaming up to develop a Brazilian soybean futures contract.
A statement from CME Group says the creation of contract is in response to customer demand for regional hedging and price discovery tools which will represent the export price at Brazilâ€™s port of Santos and be an extension of the mini-soybean futures and options contracts already listed on both exchanges.
If approved by regulators, the contract will launch in the third quarter of 2020.
