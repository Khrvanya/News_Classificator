Crude oil traded with gains on Monday as oil fields in southwest Libya began shutting down after forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar closed a pipeline, potentially reducing national output to a fraction of its normal level.
Crude oil futures on MCX were up 1.39 per cent to Rs 4,220, while natural gas sank 4.69 per cent to Rs 136.10.
On NCDEX, castor seed, chana, mustard seeds, soybean and refined soybean oil were in the green while coriander, jeera and kapas were in the red.
