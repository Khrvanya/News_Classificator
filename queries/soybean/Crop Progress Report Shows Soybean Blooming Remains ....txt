According to the latest USDA Crop Progress report, the percentage of corn silking and, to a larger degree, soybean blooming progress remains well ahead of where it was last year.
For the week ended June 28, the report shows 4% of corn silking, double the 2% reported silking this time last year, but below the 5 year average of 7%. Texas and North Carolina continued to lead the charge at 62% and 45% of their corn silking, respectively. Corn crop condition remained relatively unchanged from last week, aside from the percentage of crops in "excellent" condition rising from 15% to 16%, well above the 9% considered "excellent" this time last year.
Nearly all soybeans (95%) were reported emerged in the week ended June 28, ahead ofÂ last year's progress (80%) and the 5 year average (91%). Louisiana and Nebraska were the first to report 100% of their soybeans emerged. Soybean blooming has shown remarkable increases compared to last year's progress, reaching 14% in the week compared to just 2% this time last year. Louisiana was noticeably the furthest along at 72% of its soybeans blooming, followed by Mississippi at 47%. Like corn condition, the only change to soybean condition was a 1% increase in soybean crops in "excellent" condition (reaching 13%), above the 7% reported this time last year.
