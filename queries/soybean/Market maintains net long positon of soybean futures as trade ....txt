WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Market speculators still held net long position of soybean futures this week as China and the United States made progress in trade talks in mid-October.
According to a report from U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday, non-commercial investors, commonly treated as market speculators, held a net long position of 91,456 soybean future contracts for the week ending Tuesday.
Meanwhile, commercial traders that are commonly treated as hedgers held a net short position of 89,450 contracts.
Speculators and hedgers are different types of investors. Speculators try to make a profit from the assets' price volatility, whereas hedgers attempt to reduce or "hedge" the amount of risk created by price volatility during the holding period of the assets.
When investors "short" some kind of financial asset like currencies or commodities, they hold a bearish view on the asset and believe that it will decrease in price.
The soybean futures, traded at the Chicago Board of Trade, are derivative financial contracts that obligate the parties to transact an underlying asset at a predetermined future date and price. The underlying asset of each contract includes 5,000 bushels of soybeans.
