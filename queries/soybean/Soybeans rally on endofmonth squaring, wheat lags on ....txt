CHICAGO — U.S. soybean futures rose nearly 2% on Thursday, their biggest single-day advance in a month, on strong weekly export sales and hopes that recent declines would attract additional demand, analysts said.
Corn futures firmed for a second day on strong export sales and signs that the worst impacts of the collapse in the ethanol sector may have passed.
Wheat rallied from a six-week low, rebounding on better-than-expected weekly U.S. export data and worries about tightening global supplies.
Soybeans posted the biggest advances on a percentage basis.
“Weekly export sales were really solid across the board … there is a rumor that China is back to buy some more, and that may be the case,” said Terry Linn, analyst with Linn & Associates in Chicago.
Futures also drew support from short-covering at the end of the month and ahead of the May Day three-day weekend observed in much of the world.
“You have some positive news around – just enough to help stimulate end-month profit taking and technical corrections in oversold markets,” Linn said.
As of 11:50 a.m. CDT, Chicago Board of Trade July soybeans were up 15 cents at $8.52-1/2 per bushel and July corn was up 4-1/2 cents at $3.19 a bushel.
For the month of April, CBOT July corn was on track to fall about 8%, its fourth straight monthly slide, pressured as demand for corn-based ethanol fuel collapsed. CBOT July soybeans fell more than 4%, its second straight monthly decline and the biggest drop since January 2020.
CBOT July wheat was up 1-3/4 cents at $5,18-1/4 a bushel, rallying after dipping to $5.06-3/4, its lowest since March 18.
CBOT July wheat was on track to fall 7.8% for the month, retreating after a 7% climb in March.
The U.S. Agriculture Department pegged weekly soybean export sales in the week ended April 23 at 1.078 million tonnes for 2019/20 marketing year shipment and 105,000 tonnes for 2020/21 shipment. Both were within the range of analyst estimates.
Weekly sales of old-crop corn topped expectations at 1.357 million tonnes, while new-crop sales aligned with trade estimates at 339,000 tonnes.
Weekly sales of old-crop wheat totaled 467,400 tonnes, above trade expectations. New-crop sales were in line with trade estimates at 155,100 tonnes.
The International Grains Council (IGC) trimmed its forecast for global wheat production in the 2020/21 season, driven partly by downward revisions for Russia, Ukraine and the European Union.
