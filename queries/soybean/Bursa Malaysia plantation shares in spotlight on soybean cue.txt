KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 13): Malaysian equities may today take their cue from crude palm oil (CPO) prices and plantation shares after US soybean futures jumped to a 2-1/2-month high overnight.
CPO tracks soybean oil prices because both commodities are substitutes for each other.
At Bursa Malaysia yesterday, the FBM KLCI fell 3.21 points or 0.2% to close at 1,754 points while the Kuala Lumpur Plantation Index added 6.24 points or 0.08% to 7,944.37. CPO for December 2017 settled at RM2,711 a tonne.
Overnight, Reuters reported that Chicago soybean futures jumped to a 2-1/2-month high on Thursday after the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) lowered its US soybean yield estimate in a monthly report, bucking trade expectations for a slight increase.
Soybean futures surged after the USDA cut its US soy yield estimate to 49.5 bushels per acre, down from 49.9 in September and below all but one estimate in a Reuters poll.
Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) November soybeans settled up 26-3/4 cents at US$9.92 per bushel after reaching US$9.97-3/4, the contract's highest since Aug. 1. CBOT December corn ended up 3 cents at US$3.49 a bushel while December wheat fell 2-3/4 cents to US$4.30-1/2 a bushel.
