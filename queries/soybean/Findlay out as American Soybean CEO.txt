Ryan Findlay is no longer the CEO of the American Soybean Association, the organization confirmed to Agri-Pulse Saturday.
In a statement to Agri-Pulse, an ASA spokesperson said the group’s board of directors “is appreciative of Ryan Findlay’s dedication to and hard work on behalf of the soybean industry.”
“As we go through this transition, the Board remains fully confident in its ASA staff, both in St. Louis and Washington, D.C., and the value that this team continues to provide to the soybean industry,” the spokesperson said. “ASA’s governing body is supportive of the organization’s growth, including the independent policy office in D.C. and internal management structure established organization-wide under Mr. Findlay’s leadership the past year.
“We have no doubts that this strong framework will continue to thrive and serve the soy industry, its members and partners. Our D.C.-based Government Affairs team led by Christy Seyfert is, excitedly, fully staffed as of June 1 and flourishing, and our investment in and support of this new advocacy team and their important initiatives for soy remains steadfast.”
Findlay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brian Vaught, who currently serves as ASA’s chief financial officer, will step in as the organization’s interim CEO.
