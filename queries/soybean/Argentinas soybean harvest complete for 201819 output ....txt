New Delhi — The soybean harvest in Argentina for the 2018-19 crop year that started in September was 100% complete as of Wednesday.
Total soy production reached 56 million mt, up 48% year on year on a 19-year high yield of 3.36 mt/hectare, according to the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange report, released Thursday.
Higher soybean production in Argentina could lead to increased competition with Brazil, the world's top beans exporter, as China looks to South America for soybean purchases amid an ongoing US-China trade dispute.
China is the biggest soybean importer in the world, accounting for more than 60% of total global soy purchases in 2017-18.
Argentina was forecast to export 7.75 million mt of soybeans in 2018-19, a 267% year-on-year jump, with China the primary purchaser, according to a recent US Department of Agriculture report.
Argentinian soy meal exports in 2018-19 were forecast to grow 10% on year to 31 million mt, and soy oil exports were forecast 11% higher on year to 5.6 million mt, driven by increased crush volume, USDA said.
Argentina is the world's third-largest soybean producer and exporter, and the largest soy meal and soy oil exporter.
Favorable weather conditions since early this year brought the harvest level 1.3 percentage points ahead of the five-year average, the report said.
Last year, an extended heat wave in Argentina affected the moisture and yield forecast for soybeans. This year, favorable weather conditions have caused soybean yield and production estimates to be revised upward.
The first soybean crop and second soybean crop were 100% harvested as of Wednesday, the report said.
Planting of first soybeans takes place in September, while the second soy crop is planted in November, immediately after the wheat harvest is complete.
