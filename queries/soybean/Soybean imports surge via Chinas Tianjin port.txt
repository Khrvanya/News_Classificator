TIANJIN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- North China's Tianjin port handled a total of 2.72 million tonnes of soybean imports from January to May, up 62 percent year on year, according to the Tianjin customs on Monday.

The main source of imports was the Americas, accounting for over 90 percent of the port's total. Enditem
