Corteva Inc. is ratcheting up a biotech-seed battle with its main rival, Bayer AG, centered on farmersâ€™ fight against hard-to-kill weeds.
Corteva, formed last year from the agricultural businesses of Dow Chemical and DuPont, said it will speed sales of its proprietary Enlist seeds over the next five years, while reducing its reliance on high-tech crop genes it currently licenses from Bayer.
