The USDA says the week ending June 25th was a strong week for pork export sales. Sales topped 39,000 tons, up more than 60% from the four-week average, with China buying more than 21,000 tons and Mexico purchasing more than 8,000 tons. Beef exports fell sharply, but Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all each bought at least 1,000 tons. Old crop soybeans exports were a marketing year low, while new crop sales were strong, mainly to China and unknown destinations, and corn exports were below average.
