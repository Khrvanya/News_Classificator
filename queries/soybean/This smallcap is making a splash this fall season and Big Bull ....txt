Lack of transportation facility during the lockdown hit operations of the company in March. On Tuesday, the company announced a 57 per cent year-on-year drop in consolidated net profit at Rs 0.65 crore for March quarter. Total income stood almost flat at Rs 355.79 crore against Rs 350.64 crore a year ago.
The company recommended Rs 2.5 per share dividend for FY20.
“Operations were disrupted at certain manufacturing facilities and depots, as a result of which goods worth Rs 16.04 crore could not be dispatched to the domestic market. Further, international shipments were disrupted due to the absence of transportation facilities in the last week of March, resulting in lower shipment at Rs 53.18 crore,” Rallis India said.
For the financial year ended March 31, the company reported 19 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit at Rs 184.85 crore.
The management had earlier announced growth capex of Rs 800 crore over next five to six years and is keen on expanding the export business rapidly.
Analysts said the company was working on backward integration of key intermediates and raw materials, which would help stabilise input cost in future. In addition, Rallis is undertaking backward integration for Metribuzin, reducing its dependence on imported raw material from China, which will improve Ebitda per kg in the long run.
Metribuzin is an herbicide used both pre- and post-emergence in crops like soybean, potatoes, tomatoes and sugarcane.
Though Covid-19 has impacted cash positions of farmers, Edelweiss Securities believes a normal monsoon coupled with government intervention in procuring rabi crops at minimum support price (MSP) will provide relief to the farm sector.
The Met department has forecast a normal monsoon for the year ahead with rainfall ranging from 96 per cent and 104 per cent of long-term average.
“While water availability across the soil is conducive for timely sowing of kharif crops, a normal monsoon is expected to boost overall consumption of agri inputs. According to IMD, the chances of EL Nino are bleak,” said Edelweiss.
