Corn: Corn futures prices continued their rally this morning on lower acreage estimates from USDA’s reports on Tuesday as well as a hot and dry forecast today. September futures prices rose 0.025/bushel to $3.53. New crop December futures gained $0.02/bushel to $3.625.
Cash corn prices edged lower at a Lincoln, Nebraska elevator and an Annawan, Illinois ethanol plant yesterday as many dealers rolled their cash bids into the September contract as the July futures contract reached expiration. A second straight day of rising futures prices led to a flurry of farmer sales as long-awaited price targets were finally reached.
USDA reports export sales and shipments in their weekly report released this morning. 2019/20 corn sales for the week ending June 25 are predicted to come in between 17.7 million – 27.6 million bushels while 2020/21 export sales are estimated lower at 0 – 7.9 million bushels. Based on Monday’s grain inspections for export report, corn exports for the week could post a second strong week of export volumes after Monday’s total came back as 48.6 million bushels. If realized, the figure would keep weekly export volume pace in line with USDA’s 1.775-billion-bushel forecast for 2019/20.
Corn consumed for ethanol production in May 2020 dropped a staggering 160.0 million bushels from May 2019 to 299.9 million bushels amid suppressed ethanol demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. May 2020 corn consumption for ethanol actually increased 55.0 million bushels from April 2020 as global lockdown restrictions to prevent virus transmission were lifted.
Corn consumption for industrial alcohol continued its rise as well, up 528 million bushels from the previous month to 12.3 million bushels. May 2020 corn consumption for industrial alcohol soared 107.3% higher than May 2019 consumption on red hot demand for hand sanitizers to combat the pandemic.
Ethanol’s recovery began to show signs of slowing in this week’s latest report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Production for the week ending June 26 rose 294,000 gallons/day to 37.8 million gallons/day, notching a ninth week of production gains. Corn consumption for ethanol production for the week was estimated at 98 million bushels.
But ethanol demand for blending by refiners and blenders declined by 84,000 gallons/day to 34.8 million gallons/day, the first decline in ethanol demand in 12 weeks. Lower gasoline demand also shone light in the recovery’s cracked armor as weekly demand dropped nearly 2 million gallons/day to 359.6 million gallons/day. Summer 2020 gasoline demand remains 17% lower than the same period a year ago as the pandemic continues to deter global travel even amid the summer season.
Ethanol stocks tightened 36.5 million gallons on the week to end at 846.9 million gallons. It was the tenth week in a row ethanol inventories fell, but supplies remain far from bottoming out. Rather, the move is more reflective of the ethanol industry tightening up excessive pre-pandemic production capacity.
Senator Ted Cruz announced yesterday he would follow Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst’s lead on blocking the nomination of an EPA official until the agency addresses the handling of over 50 retroactive biofuel blending exemption requests from small refineries. However, Senator Cruz’s incentives contrast significantly to those of Grassley and Ernst’s, who have been active proponents for the U.S. biofuels industry. Senator Cruz has been a vehement supporter of the oil industry – often at the expense of the ethanol industry and U.S. farmers – during his tenure in the Senate.
Price rallies following Tuesday’s updated acreage figures from USDA were a welcome break for producers struggling to project break even profitability levels for the 2020/21 marketing year. But how long will the rally last? Total Farm Marketing’s Naomi Blohm advises that early July price rallies typically only last two weeks on average. It may be the time to revisit marketing plans to capture these prime price opportunities, she writes in the latest Ag Marketing IQ column .
Soybeans: Soybeans also sought to continue their rally on lower acreage as August futures prices rose $0.0325/bushel to $8.9475. New crop November futures prices are trading above the pivotal $9/bushel mark at $9.02 this morning. August soyoil futures are up $0.17/lb to $28.53 while August soymeal futures continue their rally $1.5/ton higher this morning to $297.
Cash soybean prices drifted lower at several processors across the Midwest yesterday as farmers eagerly booked both old and new crop sales on rising futures prices. Most dealers finished rolling over their cash bids to the August contract yesterday.
Trade analysts predict weekly old crop soybean export sales to range between 11.0 million – 29.4 million bushels in today’s weekly export sales report. New crop sales are also expected at 11.0 million – 29.4 million bushels. Export shipments for the week ending June 25 are expected to inch up, after Monday’s grains inspection for export report found weekly volumes up 2.5 million bushels to 11.9 million bushels.
May 2020 oilseed crushings data released yesterday by USDA found monthly crushing volumes falling slightly from analyst estimates to 179.5 million bushels of soybeans. Analysts had pegged the total at 180.7 million bushels. May’s total was 3.8 million bushels lower than the April 2020 crush of 183.4 million bushels, which is not an unusual volume relationship between the two months. It was the largest May crush on record, beating out May 2018 by 7.1 million bushels. The May 2020 crush was the 10th largest crush volume on record, indicating that domestic crush demand remains white hot even in the face of a global pandemic.
Futures prices in the wheat complex inched higher this morning as winter wheat harvest picks up in the Northern Hemisphere. The ICE Dollar Index weakened 0.22% to $96.945 this morning, lending strength to the wheat complex.
Cash offerings for soft red winter wheat rose $0.05/bushel to $0.10 over September Chicago SRW futures at a Toledo, Ohio port facility yesterday on slow farmer sales. Cash prices were largely unchanged elsewhere across the Midwest.
Cash hard red winter wheat prices across the Plains were unchanged yesterday. Farmers booked light cash sales yesterday for cash flow purposes, though countryside grain movement was mostly slower as most terminals rolled their cash bids into the September futures contract.
Protein premiums for hard red winter cash wheat delivered to or through Kansas City by rail were mostly lower yesterday, as shown below:
New crop wheat export sales are forecasted at 9.2 million – 22.0 million bushels in today’s weekly export sales report from USDA. After posting two strong weeks of export activity, wheat shipments weighed for exports dropped 6.3 million bushels in Monday’s grain inspections for export report to 18.9 million bushels. In the fourth reporting week for the 2020/21 wheat marketing year, shipments were just above even with average shipping pace to meet USDA’s 950-million-bushel export forecast for new crop wheat demand.
Weather: Clear skies and hot temperatures will cover most of the Midwest today, according to NOAA's short-range forecast . A rain system will develop over the Plains by early Friday morning and will continue to linger there through Saturday.
Financials: Coronavirus cases in the U.S. rose by 50,049 to 2,686,587 cases as of this morning according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center . The death toll increased by 637 lives to 128,062 deaths as of press time. It was the largest single-day increase in new cases since the pandemic landed in the U.S.
U.S. stock futures inched higher this morning on hopes for improving unemployment numbers in today’s monthly report for June. S&P 500 futures rose 0.79% to $3,127.5 on improving economic recovery sentiments.
