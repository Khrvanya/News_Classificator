Among traders, all eyes are on the skies as weather drives the markets.
“It is a mostly quiet day with the focus moving back to weather,” says Jack Scoville of the PRICE Futures Group. “There are two different longer range forecasts out there.  Short term, everyone seems to agree that we will be hot and dry, but after 10 days the forecasts could change.  Some see hot and dry and some see rains.  We will see!”
Britt O’Connell of the Commodity Risk Management Group agrees that there is “not much by way of new news to push the market in either direction. The USDA report yesterday didn’t bring forward expectations much different than what the trade was expecting. The soybean exports have been a bright spot here as of late. With the Brazilian farmer estimated to be over 95% sold, should China be in the market for immediate protein needs, the U.S. will be well positioned. As we look forward, the hot and dry 10-day forecast has seen some rain enter into the mix.”
Several weather forecasting models have rain returning after dry weather next week, says Don Roose of U.S. Commodities.
“I guess it’s a market I would call handcuffed,” Roose says. “It’s waiting for the June 30 acres and stocks report and at the same time we’re watching the weather.”
In the USDA WASDE report Thursday, USDA reduced corn usage for ethanol by 50 million bushels, but actual ethanol production is running too far behind for current USDA estimates to hold up by the end of the marketing year on August 31.
“We still think they’re 100- to 150-million bushels too high,” Roose says.
DES MOINES, Iowa -- On Friday, the CME Group’s corn and soybean futures are mixed, trading in a narrow range.
In early trading, the July corn futures are ¾¢ lower at $3.29. Dec. corn futures are ¾¢ higher at $3.44½.
July soybean futures are ¾¢ higher at $8.66¾. November soybean futures are 1¢ higher at $8.77¾.
July wheat futures are 3¢ lower at $4.96¼.
July soymeal futures are $0.30 per short ton higher at $290. July soy oil futures are 0.13¢ higher at 27.63¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $0.45 per barrel higher at $36.79 per barrel, the U.S. dollar is lower. The Dow Jones Industrials, recovering partly from Thursday’s losses, are 721 points higher.
On Friday, private exporters reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture export sales of 120,000 metric tons of soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2020/2021 marketing year.
The marketing year for soybeans began Sept. 1.
After Thursday’s USDA WASDE report, Al Kluis of Kluis Commodity Advisors says, “Grain traders will shift gears to watching weather and the outside markets. The U.S. stock market had a rough day on Thursday. If recent months are any indication, then big selling late in the week normally sends the buyers to the sideline.”
The report’s “50-million-bushel cut to corn for ethanol is likely to be a recurring move by the USDA in upcoming monthly reports,” he adds. “This will cause corn rallies to feel and act sluggish… unless any news breaks that sends the funds running to cover shorts.”
Citing a November daily soybean futures chart, Kluis says, “You can see that prices made a strong move through the 50-day moving average (black line) last week. The price action this week looks to be more consolidation (sideways) ahead of the USDA report on Thursday. With the report favoring the bulls, will we see the funds work toward adding new long positions as we head deeper into June? Weather and exports will be big catalysts as traders look ahead to the Acreage report at the end of the month.”

Corn: 686,600 metric tons (mt) vs. the trade’s expectations of between 500,000-800,000 mt
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors will eye today’s USDA reports.
“The funds are estimated to be quietly long soybeans, heavily short corn, near record short spring wheat, and short both KC and CBOT wheat. Will the USDA report provide any data to sway fund managers to change their positions? After the report, weather will quickly become the hot-button topic. Currently, there is not a weather threat strong enough to concern the funds,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
On Wednesday, the CME Group’s farm markets close slightly higher.
At the close, July corn futures finished 1¼¢ lower at $3.26; December corn futures closed 1¾¢ lower at $3.41¼.
July soybean futures finished 2¼¢ higher at $8.65; November soybean futures closed ¼¢ higher at $8.77.

In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is 17¢ per barrel higher at $39.11. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 166 points lower.
The USDA reported on Monday that corn conditions were up 1% (at 75%) good to excellent, soybean conditions came out up 2% (at 72%) good/excellent, and spring wheat was up 2% (at 82%) good/excellent.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says friendly corn market information is ahead.
“The Energy Information Agency Report will be out today. Expect another week when gasoline and ethanol demand move higher, while crude oil, gasoline, and ethanol inventories move lower. The reopening of the economy should help stabilize or improve fuel demand, which will help the ethanol and corn markets,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “The grain markets were pressured Tuesday on improved crop ratings and private projections for record corn and soybeans yields in the U.S. this year.”
Meanwhile, over the last three weeks, Brazil’s real has rallied 22%.
“This has taken soybean prices in Brazil down by about $1 per bushel. This has slowed farmer sales and made U.S. soybeans the lowest-cost soybeans in the world. This has been positive for soybeans, and should be positive for soybean exports going forward,” Kluis stated.
On Tuesday, the CME Group’s farm markets sink.
At the close, July corn futures finished 6¼¢ lower at $3.27¼; December corn futures closed 4½¢ lower at $3.43¼.
July soybean futures finished 1½¢ lower at $8.63½; November soybean futures closed 1½¢ lower at $8.76¾.
July wheat futures closed 7¢ lower at $5.04¼.
July soy meal futures closed $1.30 per short ton lower at $287.10. July soy oil futures ended 0.13¢ higher at 28.23¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is 43¢ per barrel higher. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 300 points lower.
The USDA reported on Monday that corn conditions were up 1% (at 75%) good to excellent, soybean conditions came out up 2% (at 72%) good/excellent, and spring wheat was up 2% (at 82%) good/excellent.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says investors continue to watch U.S. crop conditions.
“The continued weakness in the U.S. dollar and the strength in the Brazilian real (up 6% in the last two days) will keep global corn and soybean buyers coming back to the U.S. market. Right now, our prices are the lowest in the world. My screen is red with stocks, energy, and the grain markets all lower,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “Watch crop conditions in Illinois, where they have struggled with too much rain and wet conditions. This is the key state for both corn and soybean production. The 2- to 4-inch rain forecasts for later this week will make it difficult for farmers in the wet areas to get a trendline yield.”
On Monday, the CME Group’s farm markets turn mostly weaker.
At the close, July corn futures settled 2½¢ higher at $3.33¼; December corn futures closed 2¼¢ higher at $3.47¼.
July soybean futures settled 3¢ lower at $8.64½; November soybean futures finished 1½¢ lower at $8.78.
July wheat futures ended 3½¢ lower at $5.11¼.
July soy meal futures closed 70¢ per short ton lower at $288.40. July soy oil futures ended 0.04¢ lower at 28.10¢ per pound.
In the outside markets, the NYMEX crude oil market is $1.36 per barrel lower at $38.21 per barrel. The U.S. dollar is lower, and the Dow Jones Industrials are 310 points higher.
Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says the markets remained mixed, to start the week.
“Grains are mixed today with support in the corn and spreads tightening between the corn and beans. Overall, today showed short covering, with managed funds near record short in the corn with crop ratings potentially improving but not perfect in all areas by far. The grains are supported with interest from China, combined with a weaker dollar that makes U.S. products more competitive,” Roose says.
The USDA Crop Progress Report today will show corn conditions up another 1% to 2% (to 75% to 76%) good to excellent, and the soybean ratings will increase to 72% GE, up 2% from last week.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says U.S. soybeans remain competitive on the world market.
“Watch the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian currency, the real. Over the last three weeks, the real has rallied 16%. On Friday alone, the real gained 2.8%. The strength in the real – at the same time the U.S. dollar has dropped by 7% – has made U.S. soybeans cheaper than Brazilian soybeans. This change in currency values opened the door for large U.S. soybean exports last week. Expect to see another week of active U.S. soybean exports,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
