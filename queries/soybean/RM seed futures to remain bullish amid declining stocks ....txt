RM seed futures to remain bullish amid declining stocks, recovering demand
The government's plan to hike import duties on palm and other edible oils will also support prices.
Rape mustard seed is an edible rabi oilseed sown during the November-January period every year and harvested from February to April. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana are the leading growers of the oilseed.
A good winter gives a good crop. Cooler temperatures with good amounts of water content in the soil improve the yield. Price also plays a critical role in determining the extent of sowing.
Higher prices are generally forecasted to increase sowing of RM seeds while lower prices can possibly lead to switching to other crops such as chana and wheat.
