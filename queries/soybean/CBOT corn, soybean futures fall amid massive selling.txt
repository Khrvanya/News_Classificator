CHICAGO, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn and soybean futures posted losses on Monday amid massive fund selling, while wheat reversed a three-day downtrend due to bargain buying.
The most active corn contract for December delivery was down 3.5 cents, or 0.94 percent, to settle at 3.6775 U.S. dollars per bushel. December wheat rose 4.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 5.0725 dollars per bushel. January soybeans were down eight cents, or 0.87 percent, to 9.1025 dollars per bushel.
CBOT traders estimated that funds sold 6,600 contracts of corn and 5,200 contracts of soybeans while buying 3,600 contracts of wheat during the session.
Investors have reportedly been more bearish on corn and less bullish on soybeans amid harvest pressure, improving weather in South America, and trade uncertainty.
"We need to get more demand to start moving some of our products," said Virginia McGathey, market analyst with McGathey Commodities.
"If we don't get that, I can see that the market continues to move lower," she added.
Wheat futures tested the lows last week and then rebounded on Monday as some bargain hunters stepped in, said McGathey.
