MANILA - Fruitas Holdings Inc on Wednesday said it would venture into the grilled chicken business with the help of its recent acquisitions to grow its market share.
The company best known for fruit shakes said it would leverage Kuxina Ihaw na and Heat Stroke Grill to carve a niche in the fast-growing grilled chicken market.
Grilled chicken will be offered through its existing network or in new stores, Fruitas said. "We are confident that we can enter the market in a cost-effective manner yet come up with a well-loved product,‚Äù said Fruitas president and CEO Lester Yu.
It will also introduce new fresh store concepts under its Babot's Farm brand, offering buko-based beverages, as well as soy milk, tofu, taho and soy-based ice cream under the Soy and Bean line, it said.
Fruitas recently acquired 100 percent of Soykingdom Inc which operates The Tofu Store specializing in soybean-related products.
Fruitas Holdings operates at least 1,068 stores and over 20 brands as of December 2019.
