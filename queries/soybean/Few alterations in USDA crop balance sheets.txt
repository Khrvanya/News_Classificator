WASHINGTON — There were no significant changes in the old and new crop supply and demand balance sheets released June 11 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the focus turns to the weather and next month’s crop production estimates.
Corn: The season-average farm price was unchanged from last month at $3.20 per bushel compared to $3.60 in 2019-2020.
• Beginning stocks were raised, as a 45-million-bushel reduction in estimated production for 2019-2020 is largely offset by a 50-million-bushel reduction in projected corn used for ethanol. Corn used for ethanol was lowered reflecting a slower-than-expected rebound in ethanol production as indicated by Energy Information Administration data during the month of May and into early June.
• For 2020-2021, with supply up slightly and no changes to projected use, ending stocks are 5 million bushels higher to 3.323 billion bushels.
• The global coarse grain production forecast for 2020-2021 was increased by 3.2 million tons to 1.484.6 billion.
• Foreign corn ending stocks for 2020-2021 were lowered from last month, mostly reflecting reductions for China, Argentina, South Africa and Paraguay that more than offset increases for Brazil and India.
Soybeans: USDA kept the new crop season average farm price unchanged from last month at $8.20 per bushel, while 2019-2020 is $8.50 per bushel.
• Beginning stocks were raised 5 million bushels with higher crush for 2019-2020 more-than-offset with lower production and a lower export forecast.
• The 2019-2020 soybean crush was hiked by 15 million bushels reflecting increased domestic soybean meal use.
• Soybean exports were lowered by 25 million bushels on increased competition from South America.
• Increased beginning stocks for 2020-2021 are more than offset with a higher soybean crush forecast, which is raised along with increased domestic soybean meal use.
• With higher soybean crush more than offsetting higher beginning stocks, 2020-2021 ending stocks are projected at 395 million bushels, 10 million lower than last month.
• The 2020-2021 global oilseed supply and demand forecasts include slightly higher production and lower ending stocks compared to last month.
• The 2020-2021 global soybean ending stocks were lowered 2.1 million tons to 96.3 million, mainly reflecting lower carry-in due to revisions to 2019-2020 balance sheets.
• For 2019-2020, soybean exports were increased 1 million tons each for Argentina and Brazil based on the recent pace of shipments and reflects increased crush demand and imports for China. Partly offsetting is reduced 2019-2020 U.S. exports. These revisions result in higher stocks for China and lower stocks for South America.
Wheat: The new crop season-average farm price of $4.60 per bushel is unchanged from last month and the prior year.
• U.S. 2020-2021 wheat supplies are up on a larger crop and a slight increase in beginning stocks. The change in beginning stocks reflects a 5-million-bushel reduction in 2019-2020 exports.
• Winter wheat production is forecast up 11 million bushels to 1.266 billion bushels with increases in hard red winter and white winter more than offsetting small decrease for soft red winter.
• Total 2020-2021 wheat production is now forecast at 1.877 billion bushels, and total supplies are raised 16 million to 3 billion.
• Domestic use and exports for the new marketing year are unchanged this month, and ending stocks were increased by 16 million bushels to 925 million, which is a six-year low.
• World 2020-2021 wheat supplies were upped by 5.7 million tons on a 4.9-million-ton production increase and higher beginning stocks.
• With increased supplies, and global use lowered fractionally, world ending stocks were raised 6 million tons to a record-high 316.1 million, with China and India accounting for 51% and 10% of the total, respectively.
