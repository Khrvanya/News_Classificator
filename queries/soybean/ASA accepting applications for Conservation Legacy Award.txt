ST. LOUIS — Share the story of how conservation is part of your farm operation and you could be recognized with a Conservation Legacy Award. The awards recognize farm management practices of U.S. soybean farmers that are both environmentally friendly and profitable.
Are you using a reduced tillage practice on your farm? Do you grow cover crops? Have you taken steps to improve energy efficiency or water quality?
These are just a few conservation practices used on some farms today that can help produce sustainable U.S. soybeans. Different regions of the country have their own unique challenges and ways to approach conservation and sustainability.
All U.S. soybean farmers are eligible to enter to win a Conservation Legacy Award. Entries are judged on soil management, water management, input management, conservation, environmental management and sustainability.
The selection process for these awards is divided into four regions — the Midwest, Upper Midwest, the Northeast and the South. One farmer from each of these regions will be recognized at the 2021 Commodity Classic, and one of these farmers will be named the National Conservation Legacy Award recipient.
• An expense paid trip for two to Commodity Classic, March 4-6, 2021, in San Antonio.
• A feature story and video on each award winner’s farm and conservation practices.
The Conservation Legacy Awards are sponsored by the American Soybean Association, BASF, Bayer, the United Soybean Board soybean checkoff and Valent U.S.A.
More information on past winners of the award and how to submit your application is available in the “About” section under “Awards” on the ASA website. All applications must be submitted by Sept. 1.
