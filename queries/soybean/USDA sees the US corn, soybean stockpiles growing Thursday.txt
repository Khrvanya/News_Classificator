Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that the grains have reacted mixed after today’s April USDA Supply/Demand and Crop Production Reports.
“There were many pieces to this puzzle for these reports, for the world to see. Both corn and soybean yields were left unchanged, ending stocks were increased on both corn and soybeans with loss of demand in some areas. Plus, ethanol demand was reduced in corn, increasing ending stocks. But feed demand was increased by 150 million bushels, increasing ending stocks from 1.892 to 2.092 billion,” Roose says.
“For soybeans, the market is reacting positively, with an increase in ending stocks, a reduction on exports, but an increase in crush numbers. Plus, a drop in South America bean production was a minor surprise. The focus will soon shift to weather in the U.S., as very little risk premium is priced into this market,” Roose says.
Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that today’s April WASDE was true to its nature.
“It shed little light on the markets between the March planting report and the much-anticipated May report that will give a glimpse into the coming 2020/2021 crop year. The new coronavirus-related adjustments reflected in today’s report were largely anticipated and provide few incentives for market participants to change their current outlooks at this time,” Gilbertie says.
Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that it was a somewhat lackluster report.
“The most interesting category of this report to me moving forward will be exports and feed usage. The last few weeks have found really nice export numbers for U.S. corn – this could be our saving grace. The rest of the world seems to be noticing that U.S. corn is on clearance and as they say, the cure for low prices is low prices. Feed usage is one that we have been looking for revisions high in, given the high placement numbers that we saw this winter. While the USDA would not make revisions to yield lower for 2019, it may make the needed adjustments on the demand side of the balance sheet,” O’Connell says.
She added, “Soybeans surprisingly showed a growing balance sheet with a reduction in exports that was not fully offset by increased crushings. No surprise in crush numbers being higher. Crush has been one of the bright spots in U.S. ag as of late and that is reflected in the report. Exports were reduced, not necessarily a surprise given our pricing in the global market.  We will continue to monitor this number, however, should some of the turmoil in SA materialize – both word jousting with China and possible port slowdowns due to COVID 19 – the U.S. may find buyers. Particularly if crush margins remain strong. China would not want to miss out on that with any slowdown in shipments,” O’Connell says.
