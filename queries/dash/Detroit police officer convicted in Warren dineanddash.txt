A jury on Tuesday convicted a Detroit police officer for a dine-and-dash incident last year at a Warren restaurant.
Jurors in 37th District Court convicted Rochelle Mayberry, 26, of defrauding an innkeeper. That offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail.
Mayberry was in a group of 10 people who walked out on a $530 bill at Sagano Japanese Bistro & Steakhouse last Mother’s Day, May 12, 2019.
Mayberry said she thought someone else was paying the bill and later returned to pay the tab, according to police and prosecutors. The restaurant manager, however, said the tab was split five ways and there was a bill for Mayberry.
The group of 10 diners was shown on surveillance camera video at the restaurant, located on Dequindre Road, south of 12 Mile Road. After the video was shown by WJBK-TV (Fox 2 Detroit), tips led to the identification of Mayberry as a suspect. She was arraigned in June, pleaded not guilty and was released on a personal bond.
Mayberry was placed on suspension from the Detroit Police Department pending the outcome of the case.
One day after FOX 2's initial story aired, someone came to Sagano Steakhouse and paid the bill, reportedly telling restaurant staff she was a “friend” of the party that left the restaurant on May 12 without paying the bill.
Macomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith said Mayberry was the person who returned to pay the bill. Restaurant management didn’t want to pursue criminal charges, but the Prosecutor's Office issued the warrant for Mayberry.
Mayberry, who testified this week during the 2-day trial before District Judge Mathew Sabaugh, claimed she thought someone else in the Mother’s Day group of 10 had paid the bill.
Mayberry’s attorney, Ellen Michaels, could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon. She previously said the incident was a misunderstanding and that Mayberry bore no responsibility for paying the bill.
Mayberry is scheduled to return to court Jan. 30 for sentencing.
