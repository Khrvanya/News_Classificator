Last night’s NASCAR Xfinity race at Bristol decided the first lot of drivers who qualified for the Dash 4 Cash event. Race winner Noah Gragson and the next three guys i.e, Chase Briscoe, Brandon Jones, and rookie Harrison Burton will race in Atlanta.
The top four finishers from last night’s race will be racing in the first leg of the Dash 4 Cash event in Atlanta. The first race will be held at the EchoPark 250 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on June 6 at 4:30 P.M EST.
The second race will be at Homestead-Miami on June 14 and the third race will be at Tallageda on June 20. The final race of the event will also run at Talladega but the date is still not confirmed.
The driver who wins the first event will automatically advance to the next Dash 4 Cash event. And the top three finishing Xfinity Series drivers will join him for the next Dash 4 Cash event at Homestead-Miami. Only full-time Xfinity drivers are eligible for competing in the event. And drivers running for NASCAR Cup Series points would not be eligible to compete in the Dash 4 Cash races.
