BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) is slated to release its Q4 and full-year 2019 results on Wednesday, January 15. Trefis details earnings expectations from the world’s largest asset management firm in an interactive dashboard, parts of which are highlighted below. We believe that BlackRock is likely to miss revenues and earnings estimates for FY19 . We expect the company to report a slight increase in revenues year-on-year to $14.3 billion primarily due to growth in Fixed Income Investments and Alternative Investments, although our estimate is marginally lower than the consensus estimate of $14.4 billion. While the EPS figure would have improved to $27.38 mainly due to the reduction in the share count even as expenses trended higher, our estimate is well below the consensus figure of $27.78. Further, we believe that weaker-than-expected revenues and earnings for FY 2019 will very likely result in BlackRock’s stock price falling once earnings are announced. In fact, our forecast indicates that BlackRock’s valuation is $501 a share, which is slightly lower than its current price of $512.
(1) BlackRock’s revenues would increase 1% to $14.3 billion in 2019; slightly below the consensus estimates
Trefis estimates BlackRock’s 2019 revenues to be $14.3 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $14.4 billion.
While we expect the growth in assets under management (AuM) for Equity Investments to remain strong, negative economic scenario and government policy uncertainty would more than offset its impact and reduce the Equity Investments’ revenues by 5% y-o-y in 2019.
On the other hand, positive growth in Fixed Income Investments and Alternative Investments segment would more than offset its impact on the top line, enabling the total revenues to cross $14.3 billion by 2019.
Although the Fixed Income Investments division has grown by 15% from $2.7 billion in 2016 to $3.1 billion in 2018, negative bond market conditions are expected to reduce the segment growth rate over the subsequent years, restricting the segment’s revenue to $3.3 billion in 2019.
Further, we expect revenues for the Alternative Investments segment to have grown 9% to cross $1.3 billion by 2019. This would be driven by higher investment advisory fees coupled with improvement in performance fees.
Notably, BlackRock’s revenues have grown by 27% over the last three years (from $11.2 billion in 2016 to $14.2 billion in 2018), however, asset management headwinds are expected to restricting growth and keep revenues at $14.7 billion in 2020
