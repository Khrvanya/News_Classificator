In the dash for cash, investors poured $249.3 billion of cash into government money market funds that hold short-dated Treasury bills for the week ending on March 18, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. The rate for the four-week Treasury bill TMUBMUSD01M,
briefly turned negative on Thursday. Government money market funds have been one of the few assets that have seen inflows in the "everything selloff" that has even taken a toll on long-dated Treasurys and investment-grade corporate debt as investors looked to raise cash. Prime money market funds that invest in a broader range of short-term debt like commercial paper saw $85 billion of outflows this week. The Federal Reserve launched the commercial paper funding facility and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility this week, amid worries that prime money market funds struggling with outflows would "break the buck" - investors actually losing money in what is sometimes viewed as a risk-free investment.
The Dow finished lower Wednesday, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq was vaulted to a fresh record close, giving the yearâ€™s second half a mixed start as investors focused on signs of economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis and a new Fed promise for clarity on the path of rates.
