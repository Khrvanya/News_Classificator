The Denver Broncos have found a couple of gem in the reserve/futures contract realm in recent years, and running back Jeremy Cox could be the latest.
The Denver Broncos are always open to improving their roster by whatever means necessary.
John Elway has managed to find really good players through pretty much every way of acquiring them -- free agency, the draft, trades, undrafted players, practice squad poaches, and even reserve/future signings, which may be the least likely place of all to find guys.
One of the top players the Broncos have unearthed in the reserve/future pool is defensive lineman Shelby Harris, who was a castoff of a number of teams including the Oakland Raiders before he got an opportunity in Denver, shined all offseason, then ultimately made his way to what should be an eight-figure contract (per year) in 2020.
You just never know, which is why we look at every guy who gets signed to the Broncos and pay attention to all 90 players on the roster over the course of the offseason.
That includes the running back position, where players seem to be a dime a dozen these days. Some of the most impactful running backs in NFL history were day three picks or even undrafted. The Broncos have two such cases with former sixth-round pick turned Hall of Famer Terrell Davis and undrafted rookie turned Pro Bowler Phillip Lindsay.
Sometimes for running backs, all it takes is a great opportunity, and the Broncos can provide that with only two depth chart spots presumably locked up in 2020, leaving the door open for reserve/future signing Jeremy Cox to make an impression.
Cox was undrafted out of Old Dominion in 2019 and signed with the Los Angeles Chargers.
Old Dominion is certainly not a football powerhouse and Cox was not even really wildly productive there, though he put some awesome things on tape. He really blew NFL evaluators away with his Pro Day performance, where he checked in at just under 6-feet, 223 pounds.
