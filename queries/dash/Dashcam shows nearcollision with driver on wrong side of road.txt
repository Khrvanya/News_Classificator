Dashcam has caught the terrifying moment a driver narrowly avoided colliding head-on with a car being driven on the wrong side of a busy highway in Adelaide's north-east.
The video shows a truck and car swerve to avoid the on-coming vehicle on the Sturt Highway near Gawler about 4.30am on Friday.
Darryl Brownsey, 62, was on his way to work, when he saw the headlights approaching, forcing him to swerve out of the way.

"I was doing 110km/hr and had to brake really hard down to about 90km/hr. [They] just flashed past really quick," he told 9News.
Mr Brownsey hasÂ survived aggressive cancer and a heart attack, but said this incident made him fear for his life.
His wife Alison is thankful he's alive, and that no one was hurt.
