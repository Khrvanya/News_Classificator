The Green Bay Packers made a pair of minor roster transactions on Monday with an eye on 2020 and beyond. The team announced the signing of two players to reserve/futures contracts , which will bring them to Green Bay for at least the start of the 2020 offseason program.
The first and most notable of the two players is wide receiver Reggie Begelton. A native of Beaumont, Texas, Begelton played college football at Lamar, his hometown university, and ended his career after the 2015 season as the programâ€™s all-time leading receiver with 227 receptions and 2,435 receiving yards.
Instead of breaking into the NFL, however, Begelton has been playing in the Canadian Football League for the past three seasons, catching on with the Calgary Stampeders. After solid but unspectacular campaigns in 2017 and 2018, Begelton broke out in 2019, finishing second in the league in receptions with 102 and third in receiving yards with 1,444. He also tied for third place with ten touchdowns, helping the Stampeders to a 12-6 record, good for second place in the West Division. They were eliminated by the eventual Grey Cup champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the first round of the postseason.
Listed at 6-foot and 200 pounds, Begelton has been scouted by the Packers as far back as his Pro Day in 2015, when the team was among those in attendance in Beaumont. There, he reportedly ran the 40-yard dash in 4.53 seconds and posted a 39.5-inch vertical. He did try out with the Falcons and Raiders at their rookie minicamps in 2016 and he also worked out for the Saints late in 2019, but went unsigned in all instances.
Joining Begelton on a futures contract is fullback Elijah Wellman , a fullback from West Virginia. Wellman finished his college football eligibility after the 2018 season and earned an undrafted free agent contract with Washington as a rookie. However, he landed on injured reserve in training camp and received an injury settlement. He came back with Washington on a futures contract last year, but the team waived him just after the start of training camp and he remained out of football throughout the remainder of 2018.
A versatile H-back who has played fullback and tight end for the Mountaineers, Wellman carried the football 35 times for 137 yards and a touchdown over his college career. He added 16 receptions for 71 yards and three scores.
The Packers still have an open spot on their 53-man roster, as these signings do not count against the active roster limit.
