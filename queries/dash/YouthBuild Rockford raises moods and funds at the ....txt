Have you ever wanted to run a 5k but felt like it was just out of your reach? YouthBuild Rockford took that thought and put a funny spin on the classic on Saturday.
Playing off of the intensity of the tried and true 5K, the Downtown Dawdler Dash is a 0.5K, just a block and half from the parking lot of the Lombardi Club on Olive Street to Prairie Street Brewing Company.
Working in the Rockford region for more than 25 years, the youth empowerment organization gives kids the chance to work the skills to improve their futures.
"When the kids come to us, they're out of school and out of work. So, we help them get them get their high school diploma, we work on leadership skills, workforce readiness skills, as well as lifeskills... interviewing, getting places on time, wearing a uniform, trying to get them ready for the workforce," said Katrina Carlson.
