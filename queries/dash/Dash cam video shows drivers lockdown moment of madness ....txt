A man who drove at more than 60mph through a residential area while being chased by police has avoided jail.
Police dash cam footage captured Ryan Bagnall driving at high speed through red traffic lights and the wrong way around two roundabouts during the chase in Wrexham on April 3.
His car was found abandoned around half an hour later.
The 23-year-old, of Corunna Court, Wrexham, admitted dangerous driving and was sentenced at Mold Crown Court.
Judge Niclas Parry gave him a 10-month sentence suspended for two years, ordered him to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work, and disqualified him from driving for two years.
Bagnall must also take an extended retest before getting back behind the wheel.
