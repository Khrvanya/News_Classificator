A previous version of this report misstated the commission policies for existing members. It has been corrected.
Third-party delivery service DoorDash said Tuesday that it is suspending commissions for new and existing restaurant members as part of a package to help its "partners" manage the coronavirus pandemic. Many restaurants using DoorDash and other meal-order companies are small businesses that are feeling the pinch as customers eat more meals at home. Through the end of April, restaurants that sign up for DoorDash will be able to do so for free and won't have to pay commission for 30 days. Existing members will pay no commissions on pickup orders and could be eligible for other cost reductions. More than 100,000 restaurants will also have free access to DashPass, a subscription service in which customers don't pay for delivery. DoorDash said merchants listed on DashPass typically see increased sales. Restaurant commissions will also be lowered for existing members. DoorDash is "earmarking" $20 million for increased merchant marketing efforts. And the company is switching the default delivery service to the no-contact option. GrubHub Inc. GRUB,
