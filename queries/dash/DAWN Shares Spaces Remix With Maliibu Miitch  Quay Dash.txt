Boundary-pushing r&b singer DAWN today drops her first original music since releasing the critically-acclaimed album new breed earlier this year. Today she shares a remix of album highlight “spaces,” featuring two of New York’s finest new rappers in Quay Dash and Maliibu Miitch.
Produced by Sam Binga (a veteran UK producer who’s collaborated with Paul Wall, Addison Groove and more), the remix takes the original song’s status as a female empowerment anthem to the next level, with Maliibu Miitch and Quay Dash slapping down naysayers with the charisma and lyricism that’s seem them emerge as two of the most respected new talents in hip-hop today.
Hailing from the Bronx, Maliibu Miitch broke through with 2017’s Maliibu Miitch Top 5 mixtape and has since collaborated with Charli XCX, Tommy Genesis, Brooke Candy and more, prompting Pitchfork to ask “is Maliibu Miitch NYC’s best new rapper?” Quay Dash meanwhile was responsible for one of last year’s best underground rap releases in her no holds barred Transphobic EP, picking up acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork and Dazed while collaborating with producers such as Sega Bodega and SOPHIE.
The “spaces” (remix) comes ahead of a series of new singles by DAWN scheduled for later this year – details coming soon.
