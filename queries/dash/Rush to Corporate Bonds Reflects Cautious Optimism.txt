In shifting away from stocks, investors are unfazed by debt loads despite slower earnings growth
Some investors are shifting money from stocks into corporate bonds, a sign that concern about slower earnings growth isnâ€™t leading to worries about the ability of companies to pay back their debts.
In August, investors pulled a net $46.2 billion from stock funds, the biggest monthly outflow this year, and added $13.5 billion to taxable bond portfolios, according to data provider Lipper.
