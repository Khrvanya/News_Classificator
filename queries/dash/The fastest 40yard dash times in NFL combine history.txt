Members of the NFL Draft Class of 2020 will race against the clock this week in Indianapolis at the NFL Scouting Combine, where the fastest draft prospects in the class will attempt to match or break John Rossâ€™ all-time record in the 40-yard dash.
The 40-yard dash has long been the premier event at the combine, and a solid performance by a wide receiver or a defensive back in the 40 can have a significant impact on their draft stock. Ross set a record of 4.22 seconds in 2017 and was selected ninth overall in the first round by the Cincinnati Bengals.
Here are the 14 players with the fastest 40-yard dash times in combine history.
: Former Alabama star Henry Ruggs III ran a 4.27 40-yard dash to join the list in 2020.
3-time Pro Bowler, 2009 Offensive Player of the Year, NFL record for yards from scrimmage in a season (2,509 in 2009)
Played in 20 NFL games, mostly as a kick returner
Played in 5 games total, currently plays for the DC Defenders in the XFL
