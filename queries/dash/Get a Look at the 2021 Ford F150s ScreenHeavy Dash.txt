Spy pics of the next-gen F-150's interior show off big screens and a trick new shift lever.
Despite its old age, the Ford F-150 remains the unchallenged king of the sales charts. And with a redesigned version of the pickup on the horizon, we don't see this reality changing anytime soon.Â Details on the 2021 Ford F-150 are slowly starting to trickle in, and this week there's some rather big news thanks to a forum user who's posted photos of the next-gen F-150's interior in high-spec Lariat trim.
The photos, uploaded by Sequoia Sam to F150Gen14.com , reveal a high-tech cabin. We can see a fully digital instrument cluster, as well as a massive central touchscreen. The new cabin seems to be a big upgrade from the current F-150, which sports a touchscreen that looks quite dated. The center console controls are laid out in a similar fashion as the old model, though.
It appears that Ford has reworked the F-150's shifter design. It's supposedly a stowaway shifter, although it's not exactly clear how this works. The steering wheel also looks different than before.
This truck also sports two-tone upholstery, presumably leather. We hope it is as durable as it is handsome. Another cool detail: A Lariat tag inside the cabin features pop-rivets with a Ford engraving.
Ford said in February that the new F-150 will arrive in the second half of this year. Specs haven't been released, but the next-generation model is expected to include gasoline-electric hybrid and battery-electric variants. A VIN decoder for the 2021 Ford F-150 recently gave us a few clues of what else we might expect for the new truck.
Given how critical the F-150 is to the lineup, Ford is investing around $700 million to make the next-gen pickup at its Dearborn assembly plant. The current-gen pickup, which launched for the 2015 model year, was also a huge deal, as it marked a shift to an aluminum-intensive body structure.
