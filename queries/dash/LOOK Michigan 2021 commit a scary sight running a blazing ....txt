‘Speed in space’ — it’s not just for the offense anymore.
While the 2020 iteration of the Michigan defense may be its fastest yet, with multiple speedy players across the unit, the team is continuing to recruit prospects that can absolutely fly, regardless of size. Such is the case for the Wolverines’ first four-star pledge on the defensive side of the ball in the 2021 class.
The offensive commits already had prowess of their own, but the situation didn’t start looking up for Don Brown’s side of the ball until Ravenwood High School (Brentwood, Tennessee) four-star Junior Colson — an inside linebacker expected to play VIPER in Ann Arbor — pledged to the class. Since, the maize and blue have picked up a bevy of four-stars on defense.
But, how quick is Colson? Well, take a look for yourself, as he runs below a 4.6 40-yard dash, despite being 6 feet, 3 inches and 228 pounds.
Colson is one of two four-star linebackers committed to the Wolverines, along with Fort Lauderdale (FL) St. Thomas Aquinas’ Jaydon Hood.
Michigan has 19 commits in the 2021 class, which is ranked No. 7 nationally.
