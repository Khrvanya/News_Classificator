Wisconsin troopers share dash cam from pileup that killed four, injured seven
Wisconsin troopers shared a trucker’s dash cam video from a serious pileup crash that killed and injured multiple people last week.
The series of crashes occurred on the morning of June 12 near Lodi on I-90/94/39 at WIS 60.
Around 4 a.m., two semi trucks were involved in a rear-end crash on the interstate.
Troopers say that a straight truck struck the previous crash site around 5 a.m., causing serious injury to two state troopers and a highway worker.
At 6:45 a.m., another crash occurred on northbound I-90/94/39 in the traffic backup caused by the previous crashes. Troopers describe this crash as “a major, multi-vehicle crash [that] occurred along the northbound interstate near County K resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. A semi-tractor traveling at highway speeds created a chain-reaction crash involving at least seven vehicles – two semi-tractor trailers, a dump truck and four passenger vehicles.”
Four people lost their lives in the crash, including the truck driver who initiated the crash..
New Hampshire-based truck driver Michael Hayes caught the incident on dash cam and immediately stopped to try to help the crash victims.
Hayes told WKOW , “The truck that was in front of me never touched his brakes. He hit the stopped traffic at 70 miles per hour.”
Wisconsin troopers say that five Good Samaritans were able to pull two people from a burning vehicle.
