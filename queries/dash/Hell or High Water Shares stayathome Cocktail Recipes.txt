While we all #stayathome, the friendly bar team at Louisville’s most creative cocktail venue, Hell or High Water, is sharing cocktail recipes the budding mixologist can make at home. Hell or High Water is led by brother-sister duo and Louisville natives, Stirling and Maud Welch. The menu is divided into “Hell” with stronger, more spirit-driven cocktails and “High Water” sporting refreshing, brighter and lighter beverages.
“While we all do our part to ‘flatten the curve’ the team at Hell or High Water hopes these recipes offer our friends the chance to enjoy cocktails just as they would in our bar,” said Stirling Welch. “We look forward to welcoming our customers #belowwhiskeyrow very soon!”
