A Connecticut State Trooper captured a trucker’s “narrow brush with death” on dash cam.
The dash cam video was shared on June 10 by Connecticut State Police – Troop E Montville.
Troopers detailed the hair-raising incident:
A State Trooper and the operator of this tractor trailer, carrying nearly two dozen 43′ 1,500 pound steel pipes used for gas lines, had a narrow brush with death. While the Trooper was stopped at an accident scene on I-95 northbound in Stonington, an oncoming tractor trailer slammed on its brakes causing two of the pipes to dislodge and travel into the cab of the tractor trailer and out the windshield. No injuries to either the truck driver or State Trooper were sustained.
Whether operating a passenger car or commercial motor vehicle, it is imperative to check and secure your load prior to operating the vehicle. In addition, always be aware of your surroundings, specifically when travel ways become congested.
