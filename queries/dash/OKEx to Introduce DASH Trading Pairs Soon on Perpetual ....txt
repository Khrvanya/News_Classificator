As per an official announcement on the website, the Dash perpetual swap trading will go live on the platform from March 11, 07:00 (UTC). It further stated,
In order to offer a better trading experience and enhance the liquidity in the perpetual swap market, we will offer higher maker rebates for all cryptocurrencies other than 9 major assets (BTC, ETH, EOS, LTC, BCH, XRP, ETC, BSV, TRX) by lowering the maker fee rates of all tiers by 0.020% based on the current fee schedules. We will also increase the taker fee rates of all tiers by 0.030% based on the current fee schedules.
Malta-based OKEx has been aggressively working to increase its userbase, and expanding trading options is one of the prominent ways to attract more and more traditional investors. Also, adding more options boosts liquidity, which is one quality that most crypto companies lack. The giant crypto exchange launched the derivatives based perpetual swap in December 2018.
