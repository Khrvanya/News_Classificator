Because of Covid-19 restrictions, local asphalt stock car speedways in Western New York have been silent to this point and their drivers have been parked as far as competitions go.
That is about to change, albeit a little further south of this core area.
The Race of Champions, in conjunction with Lake Erie Speedway, will showcase two days of asphalt stock car racing Friday and Saturday. Lake Erie Speedway is located in North East, Pa. In Pennsylvania, under that state's Covid-19 regulations, spectators are allowed at race tracks, making these events financially viable.
Many race-starved Buffalo-area competitors and fans are expected to make the trip. Joining in the action will be several other race teams from throughout the northeastern U.S.
Lake Erie Speedway is a little more than an hour drive from the Buffalo area proper.
"We're very fortunate to have a great partner in Lake Erie Speedway," Joe Skotnicki, Race of Champions operator, said. "As the pandemic progressed A.J MooreÂ  (Lake Erie general manager) and I started working and looking at this because we felt there might be an opportunity, but we weren't sure. Now we have that opportunity.
"Obviously, we're excited. You really can't present our style of racing without the fans. The fans make it possible, and we're really looking forward to some great nights this Friday and Saturday because we can have fans at the facility. I'll look forward to seeing the fans as well as the race teams and hoping we can entertain some folks."
