Strong sales of disinfectants and medicines ahead of government lockdowns helped Reckitt Benckiser to post what is thought to be its strongest sales growth since its merger two decades ago.
The FTSE 100 group said that first-quarter like-for-like sales rose 13.3 per cent to Â£3.5 billion in the three months to the end of March, far outpacing the 5.3 per cent consensus forecasts of analysts.
There was demand for its Dettol and Lysol disinfectants, Mucinex cough medicines and Nurofen painkillers.
It is thought to be the biggest quarterly increase since the company was formed in 1999 through the merger of Reckitt & Colman and Benckiser of the Netherlands. Reckitt, based in Slough, operates in more than 60 countries and employs more than 40,000 people.
