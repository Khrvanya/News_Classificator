Red Deerians who have been missing Food Truck Fridays will get a chance to feast at a similar event this week.
The first Food Truck Drive and Dash, presented by Food Truck Fridays, will take place in Westerner Park’s northwest parking lot from 4 to 7 p.m. on Thursday evening.
The event will also run from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Friday in the same location.
“We miss people. All us food truck vendors miss the face-to-face interactions, the joking around,” said organizer Jonathon Strome.
“But we are excited for this new opportunity, and we want to make the most of what we are able to do.”
Diners will enter the parking lot, join a line for a specific food truck and place their order with an attendant while sitting in their vehicle.
Participating trucks and their menus can be seen at www.driveanddash.ca . Attendees can go online before coming, so they have an idea of what they may want to order.
“It’ll help you pick what you want. You’ll see the pricing,” said Strome.
Food Truck Fridays has been running in Red Deer for more than seven years, most recently in the Carnival Cinemas parking lot in the downtown.
But due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the traditional food truck event was cancelled and the new drive-thru version was born.
Strome said the parking lot at Westerner Park was the perfect location because a lot of space is needed.
“We need room for cars to line up,” he said.
“If … there’s more than a few cars waiting, you’ll be able to get into that lineup still.”
Food Truck Fridays hasn’t hosted an event on the south end of the city before, Strome added.
“This gives people who maybe couldn’t have come in the past to come now,” he said.
Food Truck Drive and Dash will run throughout June and will continue through the summer if there is enough support.
Attendees, who must be in a vehicle to buy food from a truck, are encouraged to use debit or credit.
