Ferndale, MI- Photos of a pair of women are making the rounds on social media after Pop’s for Italian owner Brian Kramer asked the public to help identify them after they reportedly walked out without paying their bill Saturday evening. Kramer made a police report about the theft.
Pop’s for Italian is located at 280 W Nine Mile Rd #2, Ferndale, MI 48220.
Anyone with more information can contact the Ferndale Police at 248-541-3650.
UPDATE:  After less than 24 hours after the incident, the women returned to Pop’s for Italian where they paid their bill and left the waitress they had stiffed a $40 tip.
“We called the police and they met with the suspects this AM, updated report with their names, and the legal part is now the hands of our police departments. If I can press charges we will,”  Kramer said.
“I suspect the video and social media pressure is why the suspects returned and paid the bill and tip. Special thanks to our community for help in sharing post. I think that’s real story…..Our community is very special and we help each other.”
