According to one recent NFL mock draft, Texas wide receiver Devin Duvernay’s draft stock has significantly increased.
Duvernay has been projected to be a mid-round selection in the 2020 NFL Draft, often landing in the fifth round.
Although this is an extremely strong wide receiver class, Duvernay is one of the most underrated prospects. He recorded a 40-yard dash time of 4.39 seconds at the NFL combine and arguably has the best hands in the draft.
One of the most jaw-dropping accomplishments of Duvernay’s four-year collegiate career is he did not miss a single game. He’s speedy, consistent, and has high character. Why not take a chance on him?
ESPN’s Todd McShay recently released a two-round mock draft that included Duvernay being selected in the second round.
At No. 60 overall to the Baltimore Ravens, McShay feels the Ravens could use another possession receiver. Duvernay would provide an immediate weapon for quarterback Lamar Jackson.
If Duvernay does, in fact, hear his name called on Day 2 of the 2020 NFL Draft, he would likely be the first player from Texas selected. Safety Brandon Jones and wide receiver Collin Johnson are also projected to be mid-round selections.
