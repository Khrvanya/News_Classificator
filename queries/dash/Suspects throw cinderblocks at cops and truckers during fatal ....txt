Police in New Mexico recently released jarring dash cam video of a police pursuit that killed two suspects earlier this month.
The incident began around midnight on June 5 near Gallup, New Mexico, when police attempted to stop two suspects accused of brandishing a gun, who fled in a white pickup when officers attempted to contact them outside of a motel, according to local news outlet KRQE .
Officers pursued the suspects onto the U.S. Route 66Â and then I-40 while the suspects at times drove on the wrong side of the roadway.
While the pursuit continued on I-40 for about 6 miles, the suspects threw multiple objects from the bed of the pickup at police and truckers on the interstate, including several cinderblocks, bicycles, a tire, and a gas canister.
Shortly after a New Mexico State Police sergeant parked in the median opened fire with a shotgun, the pickup crashed head-on into a semi truck on I-40.
The two suspects, later identified as driver Gerald John, 25, and passenger Ray Lee Jim, 21, died at the scene after they were ejected from the pickup. It is not clear whether the suspects were hit by gunfire.
No one inside the semi truck was hurt.
New Mexico State Police say that John had active felony warrants for attempted murder, armed robbery, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and car theft.
