Breaking down the three MAC representatives’ NFL Combine performances in Indianapolis.
The NFL Combine interviews commenced this weekend for the next class of hopeful future NFL stars. Three former MAC players were among the Combine participants — Western Michigan running back LeVante Bellamy , Ball State right tackle Danny Pinter , and ex-Buffalo wide receiver K.J. Osborn (transferred to Miami (FL)). Here is how the trio performed in Indianapolis in hopes of impressing scouts prior to the NFL Draft on April 23-25 in Las Vegas.
The reigning MAC Offensive Player of the Year took the stage at Indianapolis on Friday evening. As a Bronco, he was renowned for his explosiveness and ability to create breakaway runs with blistering speed. After several injury riddled seasons to start his career in Kalamazoo, Bellamy blitzed to over 1,200 rushing yards as a junior on 6.0 yards per carry. Bellamy then one-upped his 2018 campaign by attaining 1,472 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns as a senior, the second-most rushing scores in the FBS.
At the NFL Combine, Bellamy measured at 5’9” and 192 pounds. The two-time First Team All-MAC selection clocked in at 4.50 seconds in his attempt at the 40-yard dash. While 4.50 seconds is a solid time for a running back (8th out of 28 running backs), Bellamy certainly can improve on that number. In June 2019, the running back sprinted the 40 in 4.28 seconds while laser-timed. Scouts should be well aware of Bellamy’s top-speed, but the Western Michigan product performed extraordinarily in other areas of the Combine.

Bellamy finished with 16 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press. Among running backs, he finished with the third highest vertical jump at 39.5 inches, trailing only Boston College’s A.J. Dillon and Illinois State’s James Robinson. Bellamy’s broad jump of 125 inches was stellar as well, checking in at fifth among competitors at his position.
Pinter is Ball State’s first offensive Combine invite since 2015, and the First Team All-MAC selection also interviewed for his professional career on Friday evening. He only played two seasons on the offensive line for Ball State, starting 24 games at right tackle in 2018 and 2019. Prior to moving to the trenches, Pinter played 19 games and started 11 at tight end, registering nine receptions, 56 yards, and a touchdown before making the transition.
Pinter measured at 6’4” and 306 pounds in Indianapolis. As a former route runner while playing tight end, Pinter’s speed was noticeable at the Combine. He ran a 4.91 second 40-yard dash, second among all offensive linemen behind projected Top 10 pick Tristan Wirfs out of Iowa. As speed and agility are his primary advantages over his peers, Pinter checked in at sixth in the 3-cone drill with a time of 7.76 seconds and third in the 20-yard shuttle with a time of 4.62 seconds.
In the Combine’s primary strength test, the former Cardinal recorded 24 reps on the bench press. Pinter scaled 29.5 inches on the vertical jump and 110 inches on the broad jump (tied for 11th among offensive linemen).
When Osborn is selected on draft day in April, his college will be announced as Miami (FL). But before Osborn took his talents to South Beach as a grad transfer, the wide receiver played three seasons in the colder climate of Buffalo. Osborn was an All-MAC selection in 2018 as the fourth leading receiver in the conference with 892 yards on 53 catches. The wide receiver is also a savvy punt returner, leading the MAC in punt return yards in 2018 and translating his ability to the ACC to lead the conference in the same category in 2019.

Osborn was measured to be 5’11” and 203 pounds at the Combine. He ran a 4.48 yard 40-yard dash, landing just outside the top 15 at the competitive wide receiver position. Osborn’s agility was on full display, finishing 10th at his position in the 20-yard shuttle with a time of 4.35 seconds and fifth in the 3-cone drill with a time of 7.0 seconds. The former Buffalo Bull demonstrated upper-level strength for a wide receiver, managing 18 reps on the bench press (sixth among receivers). Osborn recorded a vertical jump of 37.5 inches and a broad jump of 123 inches.
