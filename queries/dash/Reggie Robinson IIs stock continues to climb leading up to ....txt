After a standout senior season for Tulsa, Cleburne's Reggie Robinson II (9) is expected to be selected in this weekend's NFL Draft, which would make him the first Yellow Jacket to be chosen in the draft since Rodney Norton in 1976. Robinson is projected to be a late day 2 or early day 3 pick.
Cleburne's Reggie Robinson II (9) was a first-team all-conference performer for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in 2019. After strong showings at the Reese's Senior Bowl and NFL Draft Combine, Robinson's name has climbed the 2020 draft prospect rankings.
After a standout senior season for Tulsa, Cleburne's Reggie Robinson II (9) is expected to be selected in this weekend's NFL Draft, which would make him the first Yellow Jacket to be chosen in the draft since Rodney Norton in 1976. Robinson is projected to be a late day 2 or early day 3 pick.
When the 2020 NFL Draft begins Thursday night and continues over the next two days, a 44-year streak is expected to come to an end when Cleburne’s Reggie Robinson II hears his name called.
The last time a player from Cleburne was selected in the NFL Draft was 1976, when former Yellow Jacket and Rice standout Rodney Norton was a fifth-round selection by the Pittsburgh Steelers. And, by most accounts, Robinson is set to end that drought this weekend.
After a strong senior season for the University of Tulsa in 2019, followed by impressive performances at the Reese’s Senior Bowl and NFL Draft Combine, Robinson’s draft stock has steadily improved the past couple months. Once viewed as a sixth- or seventh-round pick at best or an undrafted free agent, Robinson’s name has been climbing up big boards and mock drafts.

In several recent mock drafts from experts, Robinson has been going in the third or fourth round. But Robinson, a 2019 first-team All-American Athletic Conference selection, has been told his draft range varies.
“I’ve heard anything from third round all the way down to undrafted free agent, so it’s a wide range,” Robinson said.
On Wednesday, NFL.com released an article titled “Draft Sleepers: 10 prospects to target after Round 1,” and listed Robinson as the No. 2 draft sleeper behind Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor.
“This Tulsa product has the physical traits you look for in a cornerback, when it comes to size, speed and length,” according to the article. “... His 89 overall draft score was the highest of any cornerback from this year’s class. Robinson offers strong value on Day 2, especially if he makes it to the later part of the third round.”
If a team likes Robinson — a 6-foot-1, 202-pound cornerback with elite speed and athleticism — enough to draft him, the former All-Johnson County selection said he’s unsure what emotions he’ll experience in becoming the first Cleburne player in 44 years to be selected in the NFL Draft.
“It’s going to show all the hard work I put in really paid off,” Robinson said. “I’m kind of anxious. I’m ready for it to happen so I know where I’ll be able to play. I don’t know exactly what emotions will come over me but it will definitely be something. I don’t know how I’m going to react, I just don’t think I’ll be able to hold it all in. [Being the first from Cleburne to be drafted in 44 years] is going to show that it doesn’t matter where you’re from, if you work hard and do your best, you’ll get your opportunity, and if you do your best with that opportunity, you can do anything.”
Robinson combines his impressive frame, athleticism and speed with experience and production. Throughout his four years with Tulsa, Robinson saw extensive playing time and his production increased year by year, culminating in a senior season where he was one of the nation’s top cornerbacks. Robinson led the AAC with 17 passes defensed in 2019 to go along with four interceptions. He only gave up one touchdown during his senior season and finished his career with 38 passes defensed. Even when Tulsa played against Power Five teams such as Michigan State or Oklahoma State, Robinson held his own.
“He’s big-time,” one scout told The Athletic’s Bob McGinn. “He’s the entire package. They played Oklahoma State, and Tylan Wallace will be a first-rounder next year. This guy covered him. I saw him play Memphis, which could have a first-rounder next year in (Damonte) Coxie and SMU, which had (good) receivers. He always is in the right spot at the right time, in zone and man. To me, this is what you want in a corner. He comes up and he hits people.”
To go along with the frame, athleticism, experience and production, Robinson also has the smarts NFL teams look for. Robinson will graduate from the University of Tulsa with degrees in organizational studies and media, and he reportedly had the highest score out of all defensive prospects in this year’s draft class with a 32 on the Wonderlic Test.
Cleburne Defensive Coordinator Jason Payne, who coached Robinson in high school, said he’s happy to see that 44-year drought end and he’s proud Robinson is the one to do it.
“I did not know it was that long ago,” Payne said. “It’s a streak that needs to be broken more often. Any kid that’s ever played any sport, most of them aspire to make it to the professional level. To see that record broken, it’s incredible. For people that have never heard of Cleburne, they’re going to see that roll across their screen with Reggie.”
The last Cleburne player drafted said having an NFL team choose you is a surreal feeling. Norton lives in Houston and has been a high school and college football official for the past 35 years. He said he was shocked to find out he was the last Cleburne player selected in the draft. A couple other Cleburnites have played in the NFL since then, including Nakia Codie in 2000, but no Yellow Jacket has had his name called in the NFL Draft since Norton.
“I’m excited for him,” Norton said of Robinson. “I can tell you the day I got the phone call, I couldn’t believe it. They didn’t have all the combines and things they’ve got going on today. But I did run a 40-yard dash. Back in the day that’s the only thing to hang your hat on. I ran the 40-yard dash for a couple of teams at the stadium in Cleburne. It’s exciting to get that call. It’s unbelievable. I was reading on the Internet where he got selected for the Senior Bowl earlier. It’s all coming to fruition for him. Somebody’s gonna get him.”
Norton said when the back-to-back Super Bowl champion Steelers drafted him, he couldn’t believe it.
“At the time I got drafted, that was ‘76 and that was the second year the Steelers had won the Super Bowl, so that was the glory years,” Norton said. “I thought I was in hog heaven to go from a school like Rice to go to the Super Bowl champions; I just couldn’t believe it. It’s thrilling to be drafted. It has your adrenaline going. It’s an unbelievable event, especially for somebody that’s 20 years old.”
Cleburne's Reggie Robinson II (9) was a first-team all-conference performer for the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in 2019. After strong showings at the Reese's Senior Bowl and NFL Draft Combine, Robinson's name has climbed the 2020 draft prospect rankings.
Robinson said he’s spoken to a number of teams over the past few weeks.
“It’s been teams popping up here and there,” he said. “I had a Zoom call with the Chicago Bears recently. Just a minute ago [on Tuesday], I got off a video call with the Saints. There’s been a lot of teams who have reached out. It’s been pretty great. If I can compare it to anything, it’s like when you’re being recruited for college, but it’s the NFL. It’s along the same lines as that. It’s definitely something to be excited about.”
In addition to the Bears and Saints, Robinson has reportedly held pre-draft meetings over FaceTime with the New York Giants, Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans.
Football has long been a family affair for the Robinsons. Robinson’s father, Reginald Robinson, played collegiately at Grambling State University from 1988-91, and he said it’s been an exciting experience getting to follow his son’s journey to this moment.
“Emotions go up and down,” Reginald Robinson said. “It’s been real cool and exciting and fun. It’s a proud moment to see your son accomplish all this stuff. I had two teams call me, which I thought was cool. The Buffalo Bills called me the other day to make sure they had the right number. The Chargers called me looking for him.”
Reginald Robinson said he’s proud of how his son, who shares his name, has been able to go out and make a name for himself.
“I know he’s not gonna like this, but before he started playing peewee football I put in one of my football tapes and he heard, ‘Reggie Robinson on the tackle,’ and he asked, ‘Why is he saying my name?’” Reginald Robinson shared. “I said, ‘That’s not your name,’ but I told him you have to go make your own tackles and make your own name. So ever since peewee he’s been going out there making his own tackles and own plays, and now he’s here.”
Reggie Robinson II said the support he’s received from his family, including mother Celeta and sister Torameshia, throughout his football journey has meant a lot.
“They went to most of my home games and they’ve traveled for some of my road games,” Reggie Robinson II said. “I have a really supportive family. From the day I put pads on to now, they’ve been there for me every step of the way.”
Torameshia Robinson, a 2013 Cleburne High School graduate, considers herself as her brother’s biggest fan.
“It’s awesome and it’s a huge blessing,” Torameshia Robinson said. “It’s good to see my brother’s dreams coming true. That’s all that I wanted for him. I want for him to excel and succeed. He’s worked hard his whole life for this and I believe he 100% deserves this. I’ve been telling all of my classmates and all of my friends to keep him in their prayers and hoping this dream does happen for him. I brag about my brother to anybody who will listen so I’m really excited for him.”
No matter what round Reggie Robinson II is selected or what team picks him, his father just wants it to be the right fit, ideally somewhere he can get playing time.
“I want him to go somewhere he can actually play,” Reginald Robinson said. “That’s the same thing I told him about picking a college. A lot of kids want to go to big schools and sit on the bench for three years and play for one year. ... I want him to go to a team and have an opportunity to play. I’m pretty sure that will be the team that drafts him anyway.
“But I don’t care who it is. My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers, but we’ve talked already how they don’t need a starting cornerback unless it’s for the future. But whoever drafts him will become my new favorite team so it really don’t matter. It’s hard to say where to expect him to go. It’s a lot going on for him to undertake all this stuff for the last two to three months but it’s part of the process. And the COVID-19’s been making it worse because he couldn’t visit teams, so it’s a little hard to tell because it’s all on the phone and computers.”
Payne said no matter where Reggie Robinson II lands, he’s going to support that team.
“I kind of look back at his recruitment process, when he decided to go to Tulsa, and it’s the same now, it’s whatever is the best fit for him,” Payne said. “It would be awesome for him to be with the Cowboys because think of the support that could go see him on a regular basis. But I want what’s best for Reggie and his career. If he’s playing for Buffalo, I will try like heck to be at that first game. Wherever it is, and I know a lot of people are the same way, we just want what’s best for him. I don’t know that it matters where as long as it’s a good fit for him.”

A couple of NFL teams have even reached out to Payne throughout this process, a look at just how far NFL franchises go when it comes to the investigating players they want to invest in.
“A person called me from a team and his actual title was ‘national cross checker,’” Payne said. “He called me and wanted to check with me about Reggie’s character. I thought that was incredible. It’s not every day you get to have a conversation with a professional football team. Their background check is very extensive and I knew that it was, but to get to go through it made you really understand how deep it goes. Not only to be able to vouch for Reggie and his character and his athletic ability, but to get the behind-the-doors look, that was pretty cool. He’s an incredible young man. And it shows it’s more than just athletic ability, believe it or not.”
As for Reggie Robinson II’s plans for the draft, he said it will be just another day — that is, until his name gets called.
“Just a regular day,” Reggie Robinson II said. “I’m going to be sitting here chilling. I’ll probably be watching TV. I’ll watch some of the draft but depending on how anxious I get, I’ll probably turn it off and distract myself until I get a phone call from my agent or my team.”
Reginald Robinson said he can’t wait to play the new Madden video game or buy that first “ROBINSON II” NFL jersey.
“This will be the first time I buy a Madden game since me and him stopped playing when he was a freshman,” Reginald Robinson said. “I don’t even have a game console. But once he’s on a team and the new game comes out, I’ll be at GameStop or Walmart buying it and I’ll be able to play the actual game with my son on it. That will be pretty cool. And I don’t know how quick his jersey will be made or when it will be on the website, but as soon as that happens we’ll get our order in.”
The NFL Draft — which will be a virtual draft due to COVID-19 — will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN and the NFL Network. The first round is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday, the second and third rounds will begin at 6 p.m. Friday, and the fourth through seventh rounds will start at 11 a.m. Saturday.
