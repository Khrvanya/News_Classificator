Dog the Bounty Hunter sparked concern when he was checked into hospital this month struggling with chest pains.
The TV personality, real name Duane Chapman, has opened up about his diagnosis for the very first time in a bombshell interview.
The much-loved star is set to reveal he suffered a pulmonary embolism in the heart.
The condition blocks blood flow and causes major organs in the body to lose some or all of their function.

After spending two weeks in hospital, 66-year-old Duane will open up about his health scare on The Dr Oz Show on Monday.
In a preview for the show, the medical expert tells Duane: "You're a ticking time bomb. "You're not going to be here with the heart the way it is right now. Fear of death is normal.
"I'm surprised you don’t fear death when you’re chasing after convicts. But when you run away from a doctor, that means you have to do your own doctoring."
