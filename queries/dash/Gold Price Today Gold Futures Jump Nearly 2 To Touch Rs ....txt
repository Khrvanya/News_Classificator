Gold jewellery prices vary in different parts of India - the second largest consumer of the precious metal - due to factors such as excise duty, state taxes and making charges.
In the international market, gold prices inched lower as a stronger dollar and dash for cash following a historic rout in U.S. crude oil futures curbed demand for the safe-haven asset.
Spot gold was last seen trading 0.2 per cent lower at $1,683.08 per ounce, a day after touching a near two-week low as the oil rout triggered a panic sell-off in wider markets, fuelling a rush for liquidity.
