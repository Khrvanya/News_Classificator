In a blog post on Medium, GokuMarket stated that integration would provide the global DASH Community with as many real-world utilities as possible.
DASH, one of the top crypto projects globally, focuses on creating a robust digital payment system based on blockchain. Due to the variety of options that it brings, GokuMarket is a great bet for DASH as it allows it to expand its reach in the Asian markets, which happens to be the crypto hotspot at the moment.
While the integration on the mobile wallet and desktop website is a great way to rope in conventional crypto users, the starter kit will allow DASH to interact with new and potential crypto users. Starter Kits allows people to step in the world of digital currencies, as it includes several vouchers for arbitrage autobots, debit cards, e-commerce, telecom, and travel memberships.
