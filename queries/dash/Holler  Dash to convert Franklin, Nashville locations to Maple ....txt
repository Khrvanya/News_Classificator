Holler & Dash, a breakfast and lunch eatery operated by Cracker Barrel, temporarily closed all locations in January, including the restaurants at 2407 8th Ave. S., Nashville, and 203 Franklin Road, Ste. 120, Brentwood, according to signs posted on the doors at both locations. The company plans to transition all locations into Maple Street Biscuit Company.
“Holler & Dash is becoming Maple Street Biscuit Company, well-known for serving comfort food with a modern twist, gracious service, and a strong sense of community,” the company said on its website.
