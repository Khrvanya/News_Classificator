Dash Water has lined up a new flavour for its namesake sparkling water range in the UK.
Dash Peach is the latest variant to join the UK company's portfolio since last year. The beverage will be available in the off-premiseÂ channel as well as online.
The peach version is the fifth to join Dash Water's sugar- and calorie-free range, which includes: Blackcurrant, Cucumber, Lemon and Raspberry flavours.
"Across Europe, 9% of all peaches produced are lost due to overproduction or spoilage at farm level." said co-founder Jack Scott. "At Dash Water, we are delighted to purchase these surplus peaches at fair market price and to put these peaches to good, reducing waste and in turn producing the refreshing new Dash Peach flavour, just in time for summer."
