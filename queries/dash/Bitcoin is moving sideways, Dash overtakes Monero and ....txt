The Relatve Strength Index (RSI) can be an indicator to identify a bull or bear market. If the RSI is above 55, it indicates a bull market, while a value below 55 indicates a bear market. The experienced crypto trader Yadox points out that the RSI on the weekly chart is currently just below 55, meaning that Bitcoin has not yet entered the bull market at the macro level.
On the weekly, Bull market are where RSI>55, and Bear Market when RSI<55.
Right now, we are exactly at this crucial line.

Multiple billionaire and Bitcoin cop Mike Novogratz describes on Twitter that he does not yet fully understand the real reasons for the recent Altcoin Rally. One reason could be the January effect or a newly kindled euphoria about rising prices in the new year, Novogratz says.
Iâ€™m not sure I understand the altcoin rally.   Happy for those making money on it.   But not sure what changed.  Maybe new year, new money, new enthusiasm.  Dinner in NYC for best explanation.
