ALEXANDRIA, VA – Alexandria’s DASH bus system is eliminating fares on all buses until further notice, and switching to rear-door boarding, in response to the COVID-19 scare.
“Eliminating fares and moving to rear-door boarding will reduce passenger touch points, prevent potential crowding at fare boxes and promote social distancing between passengers and bus operators,” says DASH.
Individuals with disabilities or strollers can board through the front doors if a ramp is needed.
“During this time of increased public health awareness, we ask passengers to avoid using public transit if they believe they are ill,” added DASH.
DASH is operating on an Enhanced Saturday Operating Plan until further notice. For schedules and information about how specific routes will be impacted, visit dashbus.com/covidmods .
