A car phone mount is designed to hold your device in the optimum position for safe viewing of the screen while driving. They often attach onto your air conditioning vent, or have a rubber suction pad for attaching to the windscreen.
A clip-on mount will be easy to take on and off and blends in with your dashboard quite well whereas a suction pad might annoy those who don’t like getting marks on their windscreen, or who don’t like the idea of leaving a mount visible when their car is unattended.
When purchasing a car phone holder, don’t just go for the cheapest option as these can often be flimsy and insecure which could end up damaging your phone. You may also find some cheap universal phone holders don’t quite fit the shape and size of your phone, which can make it tricky to set up to begin with.
We’ve picked out some of the best car phone holders that make using your phone in the car safe and legal. Some are compatible with charging cables for keeping your phone powered up on the go, and some allow you to change the orientation of your phone depending on your preference. Most of the phone mounts we’ve chosen are compatible with all smartphones, and they aren’t all that expensive, either.
