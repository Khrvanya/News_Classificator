CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Each year the NFL descends on Indianapolis to evaluate the upcoming draft prospects through measurements, mental and physical exams, and drills.
College players who people may have never heard of can become a household name with one press of the stopwatch. One vertical leap or one 40-yard dash can put a player in the spotlight. One poor performance can destroy a player’s draft hopes.
But is too much emphasis put on the combine? Does it mean anything?
Twenty years ago, Tom Brady put together an unimpressive combine performance. Most know how his story played out. He went in the sixth round as the 199th player chosen, and seventh quarterback taken in 2000.
Good luck trying to remember the six quarterbacks taken before him.
Much emphasis is put on the 40-yard dash. So here’s a look back at fastest men at the combine over the past decade and where they are now.

Ford was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft with the 108th pick. That year he was voted as the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week in Week 9 for his spectacular play against the Kansas City Chiefs. Ford also holds the Raiders’ record for the most kickoff returns for a touchdown in a season (3).

In the offseason of 2014, the Raiders decided to not offer Ford a new contract. He was signed and released by the Jets in 2014 and then signed to a futures contract by the Titans in 2015 only to be waived in the final cuts in September. He went on to play briefly for several teams in the Canadian Football League.
