"Many of us start our day with coffee at home, so why not make it a little special? Here are a few ways to spice up your morning cup using pantry staples," the chain wrote, along with simple suggestions.
For a special brew, the chain suggests adding "a dash of cinnamon to your coffee grounds," trying honey instead of sugar as a sweetener or using ⁣condensed milk instead of creamer.
If those not-so-subtle extras aren't enough to whet your Starbucks whistle, the chain also shared recipes for three different beverages that are part of its at-home recipe box, which is an ongoing collection of recipes that's been added to over the years. You don't need Starbucks coffee grounds to make these drinks, but the chain obviously suggests them.
