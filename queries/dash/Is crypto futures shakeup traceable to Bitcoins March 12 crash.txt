In the meantime, the number of active bitcoin addresses is hiking.

The stablecoins market is doing well almost two months after the market collapsed. Stablecoins have accumulated $1 billion in total market capitalization since the start of April. The rise in market cap was significantly contributed by Tether issued on the Ethereum blockchain, which rose from $4.43 billion to $5.14 billion within the first 19 days of this month.
