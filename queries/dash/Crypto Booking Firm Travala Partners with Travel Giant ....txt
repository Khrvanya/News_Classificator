Crypto-friendly travel service Travala will now let its customers reserve any hotel that available through bookings giant Booking.com.
Travala, a service that allows its users to pay for hotel stays with cryptocurrency, will now let its customers reserve any hotel that is bookable through Booking.com.
Travala announced in a press release on Nov. 25 that it has already integrated Booking’s accommodations to its platform. The new feature will purportedly allow users to book 90,000 different destinations using cryptocurrencies.
Travala’s customers can pay with its proprietary AVA token and 20 major crypto assets including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Dash ( DASH ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Litecoin ( LTC ), EOS , Stellar ( XLM ), Cardano ( ADA ), Binance Chain ( BNB ), Monero ( XMR ), Tron ( TRX ), XRP and Dai ( DAI ). The firm’s CEO Matt Luczynski commented:
“This partnership allows our users to access Booking.com’s accommodation listings, as well as the listings from several other leading travel suppliers, which is a fantastic use case for our own AVA token and another huge step towards mass cryptocurrency adoption.”
Also on Nov. 25, Travala announced that its proprietary token was listed on the decentralized exchange Binance DEX and is currently trading against Binance Coin on the platform.
Different travel and tourism companies worldwide have begun adding support for cryptocurrencies as payment options. Earlier this month, Alternative Airlines, a travel company based in the United Kingdom, partnered with cryptocurrency service Utrust to facilitate payments with crypto.
Earlier this summer, the co-founders of Scandinavian air carrier Norwegian Air announced plans to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange, which will subsequently facilitate the airline’s acceptance of cryptocurrency payments.
