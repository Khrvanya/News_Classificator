The super simple turkey chili recipe featured fresh ingredients, her homemade spices, and used ground turkey instead of ground beef to keep it light and healthy.
Pulliam even invited two lucky audience members on stage to try her chili for themselves, and it was a hit!
Even her young daughter Ella Grace came on to support her superstar mom and tell everyone that she loved her mom’s chili too. According to the fab mom, her baby girl is one reason she focuses on her health and using the freshest ingredients in her cooking and her products.
“In my home we buy organic. People complain that it’s too expensive, but I always say you can pay on the front end or the back end,” she said. “You can pay a little more for great food or you can pay some doctors’ bills. It’s all about health.”
