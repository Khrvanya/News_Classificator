WYOMING, MI — When encountering a vehicle on the freeway heading the wrong way, most motorists would try to get as far away as possible.
Two Wyoming police officers bucked that instinct and risked their lives to protect others.
In July 2018, Wyoming Police sergeants Rob Meredith and Chris DeBoer literally putting their lives in the path of a truck traveling at 80 mph in the wrong direction.
They positioned their police cruiser in the middle of U.S. 131 in hopes of stopping the wrong-way driver at about 2 a.m.
Dash-cam video captured the tense situation. MLive included the footage, along with a video interview of Meredith, in the video above.
Despite the high-speed collision, the wrong-way driver and the two police officers escaped serious injury.
“You just know that that’s what you’re, what’s coming, and really don’t have any other choice,” Meredith said. “I mean, you could, you could pull off and let him hit a citizen, you know, but that’s not why we’re here.
"The goal is that he wakes up if he’s asleep or he sees the headlights and stops the car. We can put ourselves there, but it’s up to him to not hit us."
DeBoer, who was driving the cruiser, turned into the impact and gave it a glancing blow that prevented a head-on collision. The impact caused one of the wheels to be ripped off the truck, which continued two miles further south in the northbound lane before the vehicle was completely disabled and stopped by other officers.
An MLive review of police reports from 2014 to 2018 showed that 17 people were killed in 26 head-on crashes involving wrong-way drivers on West Michigan freeways during that five-year period.
Another 36 people were injured, 15 of them critically.
The counties in the review are Allegan, Berrien, Calhoun, Ionia, Kalamazoo, Kent, Mecosta, Muskegon, Osceola and Ottawa.
