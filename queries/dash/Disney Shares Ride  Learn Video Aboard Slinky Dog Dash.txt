Ready for a virtual ride? Then strap in and hang on:
Opened in June of 2018 along with Toy Story Land, this family coaster is perfect for kids who are ready to graduate to some bigger thrills.
Like everything at Disney, Slinky Dog Dash is full of theming inspired by the Toy Story films and its human Andy.
Andy created this coaster in his backyard from his Dash & Dodge Mega Coaster kit, and placed Slinky Dog on the track for some added fun!
Riders are considered “honorary toys” when they experience this attraction. How cool is that?
Slinky Dog Dash is the first multi-launch coaster in Disney history.
