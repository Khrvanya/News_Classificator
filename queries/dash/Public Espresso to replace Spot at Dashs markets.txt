Dash's Market customers will have a new brew to enjoy beginning Jan. 21.
Buffalo-born company Public Espresso announced it will replace Spot Coffee as the house option at the four Dash's locations. Public's full drink menu, including coffee, espresso and specialty beverages, will be available.
"Dash's continues to innovate and differentiate themselves in the marketplace and we found our principles and vision aligned," said Public partner James Rayburg.
The grocer will continue to employ baristas who serve the coffee; Public will train the existing employees as needed. Dash's will continue to serve its own food from the Marketside Cafe, too.
Both local companies have experienced growth in the past year, with Dash's opening a gargantuan store at 1770 Hertel Ave. and Public unveiling its second location , in Shea's Seneca, at 2178 Seneca St. Public has another location in the works in the former Northtown Plaza.
Dash's locations , in addition to the new Hertel store, are at 1210 Colvin Blvd. in Tonawanda, 8845 Main St. in Clarence and 499 W. Klein Road in East Amherst.
Other media reports have noted that Public would take over in Dash's "early next year," which is inaccurate.
