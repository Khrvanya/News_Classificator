The clear leadership in this market coming off the March low has been technology stocks.
The strength in that sector continues Tuesday after the third-quarter beat from Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU ), the PreMarket Prep Stock of the Day.
Micron On Sale In March: As high as Micron was earlier in the year, it was nowhere near where it was in the tech bubble, when it topped out at $97.50 in July 2000.
Of course, during that period, price to earnings ratios and valuations were meaningless.
The issue peaked in February just above its January high ($60.56) at $61.19. During the March massacre, the issue bottomed at $31.13. That low came in just under the pair of monthly lows from May ($32.18) and April ($32.14) of 2019 and just above its January low ($30.75).
Rebound Off The Low: Just as the issue overperformed on the downside— falling 50% compared with the broad market decline of 35% — it outperformed on the rebound as well.
While the S&P 500 index increased 32% at its peak earlier in the month, Micron was higher by 75% when it reached $54.82 on June 5.
Retreat Into The Print: Ahead of today’s report, the Street was leaning to the sell side.
Coming off its early June high, Micron made a quick dash to $47.10 and rebounded. That level was revisited Wednesday of last week, when it bottomed out at $47.28, and Monday, when it reached $47.58.
Q3 Beat: After the close on Monday, the company announced a third-quarter EPS beat of a nickel along with a slight sales beat.
Micron did not offer any forward guidance, but said it anticipates long-term NAND industry bit demand in the 30% range.
After-Hours Price Action: When Micron was being discussed on PreMarket Prep, it was trading at the $52.50 area, with the after-hours high standing at $52.85. Since that high coincided with its June 19 high of $52.75, the author of this article identified that as a major resistance level and speculated whether it would be reached during the regular session.
After a higher open, Micron had a brief dip Tuesday to $51.15 and attempted to take out the after-hours high, but as of noon, it had only hit $52.47.
The stock ended Tuesday's session up 4.83% at $51.52.
