June 26 marks the expiration of that largest batch of Bitcoin options, and the big question is what next for BTC/USD
Around 114,000 options contracts will expire today across several derivatives platforms, with a combined value of $1.06 billion. The expiration also comes as Bitcoin’s price finds resistance at $9,300, with a reversal taking it to lows of $9,100 at press.

Most of the expiring futures and options contracts are on crypto derivatives platform Deribit with open interest currently at $1.2 billion. Regulated exchange CME accounts for about $439 million worth of open interest.
The market expects low volatility in the hours to expiry, but from there, it would depend on what traders do. A bearish scenario is likely if the current price tanks to levels below $8,500.
Only a handful of the contracts (8,500 on Deribit) are in the money as of writing ($8,500-$12,000). As can be seen on the market data site Skew , most of the open interest (calls and puts) are at strike prices above $10,000 deeming these worthless to traders.
The imminent expiration of the Bitcoin options contracts is an event most traders are keeping tabs on today. The notable thing is that BTC/USD has traded in a range below $10k for much of June, and today’s downturn continues that trend.
A brief peek at $10,500 earlier this month was met with a violent rejection that sent the crypto to a 10% plunge. The bearish scenario has reared its head twice with the price dropping below $9,000 before recovering into a range above $9,400.
Since touching a new local high at $10,500, Bitcoin has traded between $8,900 and $9,966. The price zone near the top of the trendline has been touched multiple times and remains the target price for bulls.
For traders, a close above $9,500 on the daily charts, marked by the 20-day moving averages, could signal a breakout from the descending trendline is within reach. If Bitcoin pushes from this close to breach resistance at $9,800, bulls can aim for $10k again.
On the 4 hour charts, buyers will aim for a close above $9,300, to open up upside towards the 20-MA.
A volatile dash on the downtrend coupled with reduced volume could, however, see sellers push BTC/USD to lows of $8,900, $8,600, and $8,300 (marked by the 200-MA).
