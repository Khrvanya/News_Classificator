Kim Kardashian may have been fighting with Kourtney on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. At one point she even called her the least interesting to look at.
But all seems well between the daughters of Kris Jenner who are only one year apart in age.
And the 30-year-old Kim even managed to get her 40-year-old sister to model SKIMS which makes not only lingerie but also shapewear and pajamas under the umbrella. Two new images appeared on social media on Thursday. 'So cute,' said Kim in her caption.
Kim shared a photo of the ex of Scott Disick in a black satiny number that made the most of her curves.
The star was at home on her white bed as she posed away looking every inch the pinup.
