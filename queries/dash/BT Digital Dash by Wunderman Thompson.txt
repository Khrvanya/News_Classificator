BT's latest campaign and game "Digital Dash" aims to get kids fit for a digital future and fill an education gap created by the pandemic's disruption to school life.
Digital Dash is a new app-based game in which children can race a virtual athlete in a series of mini games that boost their strength, agility and stamina. It follows a recent study by UCL Institute of Education revealing that over two million children have done little to no homework during the pandemic lockdown period.
Children top of the leader board will be invited to participate in a live final on 23 July, hosted by double Olympic champion athlete Kelly Holmes and TV presenter Reggie Yates, who are also part of a host of influencers who will promote the campaign as part of activity across YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and video on demand.
