SINGAPORE Telecommunications (Singtel) has launched an insurance savings plan on its Dash app. The plan has no lock-in period and no penalties for withdrawals.
In a statement on Monday, the listed telco announced that the insurance savings plan, called Dash EasyEarn, accepts a minimum of S$2,000 and a maximum of S$20,000 in initial premium.
Policyholders get a guaranteed return of 1.5 per cent per annum for the first policy year, with an additional return of 0.5 per cent per annum if they sign up within an unspecified limited period. But, interest is earned only if the minimum policy amount of S$2,000 is maintained at all times.
The savings insurance plan does not have any lock-in period; unlimited withdrawals are allowed, with no penalties imposed. But a charge of S$0.70 is applicable each time a withdrawal is made to a bank account. Withdrawals to Singtel's Dash are free of charge.
Dash is an e-wallet by Singtel which offers lifestyle services such as restaurant bookings and travel insurance. With over a million registered users, it is available to everyone regardless of telco or banking relationship, and can be downloaded on any mobile platform.
