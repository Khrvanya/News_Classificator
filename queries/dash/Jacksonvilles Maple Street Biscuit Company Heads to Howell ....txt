Holler and Dash , Cracker Barrel’s fast-casual offspring, closed after only two years at the Ironworks complex on Howell Mill Road, What Now Atlanta first reported. This was the lone Georgia outpost for the Southern biscuit-centric chain.
However, Atlantans won’t have to wait long for more biscuits in the space. Jacksonville-based Maple Street Biscuit Company , which Cracker Barrel acquired last October , replaces Holler and Dash this spring.
“We loved doing business at our Howell Mill Road location and were very successful,” Holler and Dash COO Mike Chissler tells Eater Atlanta. “We built a great guest base and had a wonderful group of managers and staff.”
Chissler says both restaurants are “very similar” and merging the two biscuit brands is the “best option” for future growth. As of publication, all six Holler and Dash locations in Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia are closed and being converted to Maple Street Biscuit restaurants.
As for the Atlanta Holler and Dash staff, Chissler tells Eater Maple Street plans to retain the current employees and pay them while the restaurant undergoes renovations.
“[Maple Street] felt it was very important that they [Atlanta staff] had no gap in pay,” he adds. “The teams will begin training in a few weeks. During that time, we will add additional staff in preparation for the re-opening.”
Holler and Dash was meant to target a Southern millennial clientele when it entered the market four years ago in the Birmingham suburb of Homewood, Alabama. The Atlanta location opened in 2017, replacing the short-lived grilled cheese spot Tom + Chee at the Ironworks.
Maple Street Biscuits has locations in Alpharetta, Woodstock, and Duluth, in addition to restaurants throughout Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
