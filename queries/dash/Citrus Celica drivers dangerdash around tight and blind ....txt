A drug-addled driver fled police in a stolen yellow car then crashed into a parked taxi.
Aidan Luft, 24, sped away from a PC who spotted him driving the citrus-coloured Toyota Celica on Marton Road, Middlesbrough , sparking a six-minute pursuit.
He drove at up to 60mph on numerous residential streets just after 1.15am on May 14 last year, Teesside Crown Court heard.
He travelled on the wrong side of North Ormesby Road around a tight bend and did the same around a blind bend on Clairville Road, said prosecutor Jenny Haigh.
He drove across a pavement on Elstone Road, ran red lights and failed to give way at junctions until crashing with a parked taxi on Abingdon Road, central Middlesbrough.
Luft and a passenger got out while the Celica was still moving and he was arrested smelling of cannabis after a short chase.
