Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: ETH, XTZ, LINK, BNB, DASH
Investor sentiment in the crypto market is gradually turning bullish and a few altcoins look ready to outperform Bitcoin in the short-term.
With Bitcoinâ€™s ( BTC ) halving less than 23 days away, traders would like to go into the event with strong bullish sentiment but this is yet to be determined. If Bitcoin is able to breakout and sustain above its overhead resistance, it is likely to pull the crypto markets higher. The first sign of strength would be if the total market capitalization can sustain above the $211 billion mark.

Although Bitcoin is the leader, there are a few altcoins that are showing promise and could outperform the largest cryptocurrency next week. Here are the top 5 cryptocurrencies that could offer short-term trading opportunities in the next few days.
After repeatedly facing resistance at $176.103 (shown via ellipses on the chart), Ether ( ETH ) broke out of the overhead resistance on April 18 with strength. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are keen to buy at every higher level.
Both the 10-day EMA ($169) and the 20-day SMA ($158) are sloping up and the RSI has been trading in positive territory for the past few days. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.
The previous resistance of $176.103 is now likely to act as a strong support. If this level holds, the ETH/USD pair is likely to scale above $189.402, which is just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $251.781-$87.131.
Currently, the ETH/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the 20-SMA. If successful, the bulls will again attempt to push the price above $189.402. Traders can buy on a 4-hourly close (UTC time) above $189.402 and keep the stop loss below the 20-SMA.
On the upside, the first target objective is a rally to $208.665. As the price nears the target objective, traders can either book partial profits or trail the stop loss below the 10-EMA. The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the critical support zone of $176-$168.
Tezos ( XTZ ) rallied on April 18 and scaled above the minor resistance at $2.1819. This is a positive sign as it shows demand at higher levels. The bears are attempting to stall the pullback close to $2.4072688, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent fall.
However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. The previous resistance of $2.1819 is now likely to act as a strong support. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has been trading in the positive territory for the past few days, which shows that the bulls are in command.
The XTZ/USD pair has repeatedly taken support on the 20-day SMA ($1.92) in the past few days (marked via ellipse on the chart), which shows that the bulls are keen to buy on dips. The short-term uptrend is likely to pick up momentum above $2.40726880.
Currently, the bulls are attempting to provide support at the 20-SMA. If the altcoin bounces off this support and scales above $2.40726880, a rally to $2.55 and above it to $2.70 will be on the cards.
Therefore, traders can buy at $2.41 and trail the stop loss below the 20-SMA. As the price nears the first target, partial profits can be booked and the stops on the rest of the position can be trailed just below the 10-EMA.
If the bears sink the price below the immediate support at $2.1819, it will indicate profit booking and shorting at higher levels.
Chainlink ( LINK ) scaled above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.5948 on April 18, which is a bullish sign. Usually, when the relief rally climbs above the 61.8% retracement, it is an indication that the downtrend is over.
However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They are currently attempting to sink the LINK/USD pair back below $3.5948. If successful, the pair might dip to the 10-day EMA ($3.36), which is likely to act as a support.
Since March 31, the bears have not been able to sustain the price below the 10-day EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are keen to buy on dips to this level. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI trading in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls.
The altcoin has dipped below the breakout level of $3.6412, which shows selling at higher levels. However, the bulls are attempting to defend the critical support at $3.48, which had previously acted as a stiff resistance (marked as ellipse on the chart).
If the pair bounces off this level and breaks above $3.83, a rally to $4.20 and above it to $4.40 is possible.
Traders can initiate long positions above $3.83 with stops placed below the 20-SMA. Partial profits can be booked near the first resistance and the stops on the rest can be trailed to just below the 10-EMA. Traders can either book complete profits at $4.40 or tighten the stops further.
The bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the $3.48-$3.30 support zone. Below this level, a drop to $3 is possible.
Binance Coin ( BNB ) broke above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement but the bears are offering stiff resistance at $16.60, which is the intraday high made on March 12.
However, if the BNB/USD pair rebounds off $15.8866 and sustains above $16.60, it is likely to pick up momentum. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls.
Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below $15.8866, a drop to the 10-day EMA ($15.36) and below it to the 20-day SMA ($14.51) is possible. So far the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-day SMA since March 31. Hence, it is expected that this level will act as a strong support.
If the pair rebounds off $15.8866, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move and propel the price above $16.8183. Above this level, the momentum is likely to pick up and a rally to $18.50 will be on the cards.
Traders can buy above $16.85 and keep a stop loss of $15.85. After the price scales above $17.50, the stops can be trailed just below the 10-EMA. If the momentum carries the price above $18.50, a rally to $20 is also possible.
However, if the price dips and sustains below $15.8866, a drop to the trendline is possible. This has previously acted as strong support, hence, a bounce off the trendline can also offer a buying opportunity with the stops kept just below the trendline. A break below the trendline will be a bearish sign and can result in a deeper fall.
Dash ( DASH ) broke above the overhead resistance of $77.7166, which completed the ascending triangle pattern. However, the bears are aggressively defending $84.2556, which is the intraday high made on April 9.
If the bears sink and sustain the DASH/USD pair below $77.7166, a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle is possible. A break below this level will invalidate the bullish setup.
Conversely, if the pair turns around from the current levels and scales above $84.2556, it is likely to pick up momentum. The moving averages are gradually sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have a slight edge.
If the pair bounces off the support at $77.7166, the bulls will attempt to propel the price above $84.2556. Traders can buy 50% of the desired position at $82 and the rest at $85. The stops can be kept below the 20-SMA. After the price sustains above $85, a rally to $94 followed by a move to $100 is possible.
On the other hand, if the price dips below $77.7166, a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle is possible. If the pair bounces off this level, this can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity with the stops placed just below the trendline. The bullish view will be invalidated if the altcoin dips below the trendline.
