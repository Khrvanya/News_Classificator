One of the most popular metrics in the NFL combine, the 40 time has become fodder for football fans and even the players the coaches.
Whether it’s fast or slow, what happens in those 40 seconds sometimes becomes the benchmark for an athlete, adding intrigue and an interesting career note.
On the heels of this year’s combine, let’s take a look back at the 10 fastest 40-yard dash times since 2006.
The University of Washington speedster set the turf ablaze back in 2017, running a 4.22.
The ECU running back turned heads in 2008 with a 4.24.
Kent St. running back, Dri Archer, helped build his draft stock back in 2014, clocking a 4.26.
Goodwin was a talented WR coming out of Texas and demonstrated his incredible ability at the 2013 combine by taking the top 40 time with a 4.27.
Minnesota CB Jaylen Myrick was a top performer in the vertical jump at the 2017 combine and also torched the turf with a 4.28 in the 40.
UAB wideout J.J. Nelson was a Combine All-Star in 2015, taking top marks in the broad jump, the 20-yard shuttle, plus he added an impressive 4.28 in the 40.
Adding to the tradition of fast-footed athletes to come out of Miami, Van Dyke was tops in the 40-yard dash at the 2011 combine with a 4.28.
The Ole Miss standout missed tying the “4.28” pack by the slimmest of margins, ripping off a 4.29 in the 2019 combine.

The Kansas St. wide receiver was tops in the 40 in 2007, crossing the tape in 4.30.
Maryland speedster, Darrius Heyward-Bey, made it clear he could be a deep-threat option when he ran a 4.30 during the 2009 combine.
