MADISON, Wis. — Former Wisconsin tailback Jonathan Taylor ran a ridiculous 40-yard dash at the NFL Combine on Friday night.
Taylor ran the 40-yard dash in an unofficial time of 4.41 seconds.
Taylor finished his college career as the No. 6 all-time rusher in NCAA history and the first player to rush for more than 6,000 yards in any three-year span.
He won the Doak Walker Award for the top running back in college football during both the 2018 and ’19 seasons.
