RACHEL Riley has shared a touching tribute to her husband Pasha Kovalev on his 40th birthday.
The 33-year-old shared an adorable picture of the Strictly dancer cuddling up to his new daughter Maven.
She wrote alongside it: "Celebrating 40 years of this wonderful human today. We couldn’t love him more."
Rachel and Pasha welcomed their first child in December – two weeks after her due date.
The Countdown star says she's now in "newborn bliss" but the start of Maven's life wasn't quite so calm.
The baby arrived so fast the shocked first-time parents couldn't get to hospital on time.

She added: "Miss Maven (one who understands) Aria (lioness) Riley Kovaleva arrived on Sunday morning weighing in at 7lbs 4.
"After keeping us waiting she came so fast we didn’t get to hospital & was born in our bathroom with our amazing doula & wonderful St Mary’s midwives rushing over to be with us just in time!
"She’s absolutely perfect & Pasha & I are in newborn bliss. Couldn’t be more in love."
