Insomniac Shares More Information on PS5's Spider-Man: Miles Morales
Spider-Man: Miles Morales was one of the biggest surprises to come out PlayStation 5 reveal presentation last week, and now Insomniac Games has shed a little more light on the forthcoming game in a post on the PlayStation Blog .
“We’ve loved the character of Miles Morales for a long time,” says Insomniac Games creative director Brian Horton. “We knew that Miles’s origin story as Spider-Man was something that needed its own game.”
A stand-alone title that has been compared to Uncharted: Lost Legacy in scope, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is, according to Horton, “an important, heartfelt and essential experience to expanding the Marvel’s Spider-Man universe.” Furthermore, it has also been confirmed that Miles’ story will take place after the events of the first game. As seen in the trailer, the game will also take place in a snow-covered New York “just before Christmas break”.
Horton also sheds some light on the game’s story, saying “a war between an energy corporation and a high-tech criminal army has broken out.” He also appears to confirm a new location of Miles’ “new home” in Harlem, saying that the neighbourhood is “at the heart of the battle”. He also wanted to let us know that “Peter Parker is OK,” just in case you were worried.
A launch title for the PlayStation 5 at the end of this year, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is also being shaped to be a technical powerhouse with “near-instant loading” being touted alongside the enhanced features of the DualSense controller, ray-tracing and 3D audio — all of which are staples of Sony’s campaign for the PS5.
Spider-Man: Miles Morales has been announced for a “Holiday 2020” launch on PlayStation 5.
