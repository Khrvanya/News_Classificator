Coinbase Pro will offer Dash trading pairs to customers starting next week, according to an official announcement .
Deposits will open on September 16 and trading will begin 12 hours later if liquidity conditions are met.
Coinbase’s listing will be available to all jurisdictions excluding the United Kingdom and New York State due to regulatory circumstances.
The cryptocurrency, designed for fast payments, will not be available on Coinbase.com or the exchange’s app, although the company did confirm that a separate announcement would be made if and when it is added.
Coinbase has taken a rather gung-ho approach to token and coin listings over the past year, announcing more than 50 active trading markets since its inception.
Dash is one of the longest-running cryptocurrencies and remains in the top 25 in terms of market cap. It was created in 2014 and has a market cap of $766 million at the time of writing.
The digital coin’s COO Robert Wiecko spoke exclusively to Coin Rivet during Paris Blockchain Week in April. He admitted that while he doesn’t “expect the payments market to disappear”, he does expect Dash to find its place in the industry.
