No one was happier with this news than the victim, Dash's fourth husband Jeffrey Marty
'She was arrested over my objection at the time, but due to the pending investigation, I waited to comment until now,' wrote Marty on Twitter
He also deleted a tweet from that read: 'Anyone who would falsely use law enforcement to destroy another person's life deserves exactly what they get.'
It was Dash who called police to her home at about 7.45pm, claiming that her husband Jeffrey Marty had placed her in a chokehold
That allegedly occurred after Dash and her stepdaughter, 15, got into a fight, and the actress pushed the teenager
