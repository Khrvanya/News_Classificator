The NBA 2K League has announced a partnership with digital radio company Dash Radio and its Nothin’ But Net channel to live stream and extensively cover league games.
The alliance will begin on June 30th and include live coverage of NBA 2K League games throughout the regular season, league tournaments, and playoffs.

Lindsay Ullman, Head of Business Development for NBA 2K League, commented in a release: “We are thrilled to partner with Dash Radio’s Nothin’ But Net channel to launch the first-ever digital radio livestream of NBA 2K League games. Through this partnership we look forward to bringing the excitement of the NBA 2K League and the personalities of our amazing players to Dash Radio’s 12 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada.”
In addition to live games, the Nothin’ But Net channel will also host live post-game shows, as well as a twice-weekly hour-long show, “The NBA 2K League Show,” hosted by Aaron Groshong. All of the coverage will feature interviews with players, officials, and personalities.
This digital radio partnership follows other recently-announced broadcast deals for the league. In May, the league announced North American deals with ESPN and Sportsnet platforms , with eGG Network announcing last week that it would also broadcast games in Southeast Asia .
DJ Skee, Founder of Dash Radio, added: “We are excited to announce this partnership and think the synergies between Dash Radio and the NBA 2K League create an extremely compelling and original way for consumers to place themselves at the intersection of sports, gaming culture, and music.”
Esports Insider says: With millions of listeners across the Dash Radio network, this seems like an ideal way to put the NBA 2K League in front of more potential fans – especially while the real NBA is on hiatus due to COVID-19.
