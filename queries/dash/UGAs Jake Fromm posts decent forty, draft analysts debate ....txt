Georgia’s Jake Fromm came into the 2020 NFL Combine wanting to run a 4.89 second forty yard dash. He wanted a 4.89 to highlight his athleticism and to be able to say he could run a 4.8.
Fromm is up and down on NFL Draft boards, much like his 2019 season at the University of Georgia. His 5.01 second forty yard dash isn’t going to boost or hurt his draft stock. Here’s what his forty yard dash looked like:
Fromm has athleticism, but it definitely isn’t in the top tier for the NFL Draft’s quarterback class of 2020. According to ESPN NFL analyst Louis Riddick, Jake Fromm has ‘flashes’ of brilliance and can throw the back-shoulder fade as well as anybody, but Riddick is concerned about Fromm’s consistency:
Fromm wasn’t as consistent in 2019, as Georgia fans know, but he kept the Dawgs where they needed to be in most games. His supporting cast changed almost completely from 2018. He projects as a mid-round pick, but could got as high as the second round.
Fromm helped Georgia win lots of big games over the years. Including a 2019 win against the Florida Gators.
Fromm finished his career 3-0 against the Gators. He’s capable of helping a team win games in the NFL, but teams will want consistency out of him. Fromm’s mental talent will insure him of a back-up role where he can fine-tune his game.
