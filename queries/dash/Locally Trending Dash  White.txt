Dash & White celebrates the concept of self-pampering and encourages its customers to live a little. Rather than cracking open a can after a long day, concoct yourself a craft cocktail from your home. Dash & White carries the brand Viski , a line coming in various metals and designed for the upscale bartender in all of us. Shake and strain your beverage in their gold shaker and matching Hawthorne strainer, also available in gunmetal and rose gold. For a simpler process, but just as upscale of an outcome, pour a glass of wine in these ombre wine glasses and drop in some rose quartz wine gems to make it the perfect temperature.
