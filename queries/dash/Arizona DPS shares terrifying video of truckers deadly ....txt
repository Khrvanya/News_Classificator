The Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) has released dash cam video of a wrong way crash involving a motorist and a trucker last month.
The fatal crash occurred around 2:45 a.m. on January 4 in Phoenix, Arizona.
In the video, 31 year old motorist Josafath Rubio-Hernandez can be seen traveling north in the southbound lanes of Loop 202.
The truck driver spots the wrong way vehicle and can be heard yelling “Wrong-way driver! Oh my God!” as he tries to take evasive action to avoid the car. But as he swerves left, so does the car, resulting in a violent head-on crash.
Rubio-Hernandez did not survive the collision.
The truck driver wasn’t physically injured but was seriously shaken up.
Police are still working to determine whether drugs or alcohol factored into the crash.
