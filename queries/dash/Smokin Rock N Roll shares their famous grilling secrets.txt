CLEVELAND â€” It's been a long winter, but we've finally reached the start to grilling season!
We spoke to Billy Morris, owner of the Smokin' Rock N' Roll food truck about how to elevate our at-home grilling skills.

"Make sure you know your hot spots," Morris says. "Make sure you know where you place your food. Some of the edges get hot and it could burn your food. You don't want that."
Next, if you have a smoker, know your fire.
"Know what wood you want to smoke with, and know what a good smoke looks like. If you see a lot of grey smoke coming out of your smoker, you don't want that. It won't taste good."
