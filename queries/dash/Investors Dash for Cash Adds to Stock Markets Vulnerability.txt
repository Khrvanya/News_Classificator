Cash holdings in investment portfolios are rising quickly, raising doubts about recent rebound
Investors are increasing their cash holdings at the fastest pace in a decade, highlighting doubts about the durability of the stock marketâ€™s early 2019 rebound.
Assets in money-market funds, which are generally used as a proxy for net new cash flows, have grown by more than $2 billion this month, according to Lipper data through Thursday. That comes on top of the $190 billion investors added to the funds in the final three months of last year, their biggest deposit since 2008.
