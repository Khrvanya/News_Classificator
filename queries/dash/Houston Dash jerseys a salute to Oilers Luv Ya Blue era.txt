The Houston Dash's secondary jersey this season will feature a retro-inspired design that gives a nod to the Columbia Blue days of the Houston Oilers.
"One of our core values as a club is to take pride in the city we represent, so we wanted to honor the rich legacy of Houston sports," Houston Dynamo and Dash creative director Juan Loya said. "Growing up in Houston, there's nothing more iconic than the Astrodome and the passion Houstonians have for the history made there by the Oilers and others through the years."
The white jersey, nicknamed Luv Ya Dash after the Oilers' Luv Ya Blue Era, features a thick Space City Blue band across the chest that is flanked on top and bottom by a thin line in the Dash's traditional orange hue, which is similar to the stripes found on the Oilers' pants and helmets between 1966 and 1998. The underarm area of the jersey also will showcase the Space City Blue hue, while the Club crest will be in the traditional orange.
In the center of the thick chest band is a white MD Anderson Cancer Center logo, with the iconic "Cancer strike-through" mark, as the world's premier cancer research center embarks on its first year as the Dash's official jersey partner.
