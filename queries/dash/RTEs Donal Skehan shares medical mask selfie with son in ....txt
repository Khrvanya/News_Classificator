However, Donal took to his Instagram today and shared a snap of himself and his son in the hospital both with medical masks on due to the coronavirus.
The RTE star explained in his story: "Had a scary rush to ER with Noah over the weekend after a pretty bad fall on a concrete step.
"Got to the hospital and got handed masks for coronavirus which only added to the panic.
Following this, he shared a video of himself and his son out for a walk as he says: "He's back to himself as ya can see!"
Donal's wife was very emotional as she spoke about the accident on her Instagram stories on Monday.
She said: "What a day we've had Noah fell this morning, he was playing outside and tripped and banged his head pretty bad on the steps.
"Which meant that we had to rush to the emergency room cause it looked and sounded really really bad.
"Thankfully we got there he was OK, they monitored him and we could leave but it was so heartbreaking seeing him being so upset and scared and in pain obviously."
Sofie explained that because of the coronavirus she had to stay outside the hospital with baby Oliver.
"Also running into the E.R and seeing everyone with the surgical masks and all the coronavirus signs and everything so that was a pretty traumatic morning.
"We all went to the hospital together because Donal had to carry Noah to the car seat and put pressure and ice on the bump.
"It meant that I had to drive and we had to bring Oliver and then when we came to the hospital and saw all the signs for the coronavirus, I decided to stay outside with Oliver.
"I have to say that for me that was the hardest part of the entire process, not to be able to be there to comfort him.
I won't take any maternity leave... Spencer will stay at home with baby No2
"I know that Donal obviously did an amazing job and everything he could.
Sofie then began to cry as she explained she just wanted to be with Noah at that time.
