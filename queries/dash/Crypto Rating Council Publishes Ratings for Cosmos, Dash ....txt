Crypto Rating Council Publishes Ratings for Cosmos, Dash, and Ethereum Classic
The CRC says its purpose is "to assess whether any given crypto asset, or whether the development, issuance, and use of such asset have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws." Its founding members established the CRC to "create a compliance tool which, in partnership with securities law experts, allows the members to have a consistent framework to review assets supported in the ordinary course of their respective businesses."
On 30 September 2019, the Crypto Rating Council (CRC), which is comprised of a number of leading crypto financial services firms (such as Coinbase and Kraken), released its Securities Framework Asset Ratings , which is a set of ratings for various popular cryptoassets that says whether the CRC thinks a particular digit asset is a security or not. The values go from 1.0 to 5.0; Bitcoin is rated 1.0, and anything that does not get rated 5.0 is considered not to be a security.
Well, late last week, the CRC published a blog post that detailed some additions to its list of members and to its Securities Framework Asset Ratings.
As for the new digital assets that have been added to CRC's coverage, here they are along with their ratings:
This means that, as of today, the CRC provides ratings for 25 cryptoassets: Algorand (ALGO); Augur (REP); Bitcoin (BTC); Chainlink (LINK); Cosmos (ATOM); Dai (DAI); Dash (DASH); Decentraland (MANA); EOS (EOS); Ethereum (ETH); Ethereuim Classic (ETC); FOAM (FOAM); Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR); Horizen (ZEN); Litecoin (LTC); Livepeer (LPT); Loom Network (LOOM); Maker (MKR); Monero (XMR); Numeraire (NMR); Polymath (POLY); Stellar (XLM); Tezos (XTZ); XRP (XRP); and Zcash (ZEC).
