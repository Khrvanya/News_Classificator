Itâ€™s Episode 98 of the Utah Royals FC Show! Cindy, Lucas, and Wirtjo preview the game between URFC and the Houston Dash as Utah get ready to begin their Challenge Cup journey.
The trio also give their thoughts on the two first games of the NWSL Challenge Cup played this past weekend and on the controversy of the league choosing to play the national anthem as players chose to protest by kneeling or remain standing.
We tried to keep it short, around the half hour mark, but Wirtjo, of course, had a tangent or two, which tangents by Wirtjo are always good.
Please take care and be safe friends!
