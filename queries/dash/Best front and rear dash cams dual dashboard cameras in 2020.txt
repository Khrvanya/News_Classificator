Record what's on the road ahead, as well as coming up behind – by using one of the best front and rear dash cams
Looking for the best front and rear dash cams? Then you have come to the right place! Most driver by now are well aware of the benefits of having a dashboard camera, or dash cam, fitted to their vehicle. These forward-facing cameras record a driver’s eye view of the road ahead, then save a section of footage when a collision is detected.
But, while they are ideally positioned to capture incidents in front of the car, what if someone t-bones your vehicle at a junction, or crashes into you from behind?
This is where dual dash cam systems come into play. These offer a way to connect a rear-facing camera to the dashboard on your windscreen, thus capturing footage facing both forwards and backwards at the same time. These are usually both saved to the same SD card in the front camera, and the two are connected with a long cable fed through your vehicle.
Some front and rear dash cam systems even take things a step further, letting you wirelessly connect up to four cameras, giving you a near-360 degree view around your car at all times. This can be particularly useful when someone hits your car while parking, or vandalizes the side of your car at night.
Naturally, a wireless option like Garmin’s Dash Cam Auto Sync system is much easier to install, as all each camera needs it access to power.
If you plan to install a wireless camera in the front and back of your car then you’ll want to get them both professionally installed, so that their cables are completely hidden behind the interior panels. That way, you will only see a couple of inches of exposed cable between each camera and the headliner of your car.
