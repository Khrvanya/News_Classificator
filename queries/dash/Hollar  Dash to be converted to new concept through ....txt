Changes are coming to Holler & Dash.
The fast casual breakfast chain - which has locations in Homewood and Tuscaloosa - will be rebranding following an acquisition over the weekend by parent company Cracker Barrel.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store has acquired Florida-based Maple Street Biscuit Co. for $36 million in an all-cash transaction. That includes 28 company-owned and five franchise locations in seven states.
As a result, all seven locations of Holler & Dash will convert into the Maple Street Biscuit Co. concept in the coming months, though there is no timetable for the change.
Cracker Barrel CEO and President Sandra B. Cochran said the company’s experience with Holler & Dash reinforced its belief that the breakfast and lunch-focused fast casual category is an attractive segment.
“We have long admired Maple Street Biscuit Company with its emphasis on made-from-scratch food and hospitality,” Cochran said. “It is a proven brand with attractive unit economics and strong growth potential, and it is positioned to become a leader in this category.”
