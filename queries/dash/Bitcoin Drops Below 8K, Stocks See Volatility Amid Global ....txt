According to data released by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission yesterday, the number of open contracts for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s ( CME ) bitcoin ( BTC ) futures ostensibly hit at an all-time high for the week from May 27 to June 3.
Analytics firm Delphi Digital has meanwhile argued that bitcoin has been outperforming weaker traditional risk assets, with the latter seeing selling pressure amid waning sentiment for economic growth in 2019 and United States-China trade tensions.
In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures opened slightly higher this morning, with Dow futures rising 9 points — indicating a positive open of more than 52 points — as of 01.45 a.m. ET, CNBC reported. Futures on the S&P and Nasdaq reported similarly slight gains.
Yesterday, St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard revealed that a U.S. interest rate cut “ may be warranted soon ” in light of the risks to economic growth presented by international trade feuds as well as weak domestic inflation.
