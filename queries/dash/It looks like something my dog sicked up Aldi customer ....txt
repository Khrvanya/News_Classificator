An Aldi customer has posted pictures of his hilariously bad 'sausage and egg' sandwich - showing it contained the most minuscule sliver of meat.
Liam Jordan's snap shows tiny fragments of egg, tomato sauce and an inch-long chunk of sausage.
Sharing the picture online, he pointed out that the egg seemed to be avoiding what was left of the meat despite the All Day Breakfast sandwich showing huge chunks of sausage in the advert.
The Leicester University student complained to the retailer online, writing: 'Aldi UK Sausage and Egg... Really? Egg scared with sausage more like.'

The dismal sandwich appears to be part of the Â£1.89 All Day Breakfast Triple Pack. Aldi's glossy picture of the snack shows three sausages nestled between slices of white bread.
But Liam suggested in his post this is not the first time he has been disappointed by the snack.
