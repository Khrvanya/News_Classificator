Coinbase opens up Dash trading for all retail customers, except NY and U.K.
Dash is now available on Coinbase , the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange announced in a blog post today. Dash, currently among the top-20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, is available everywhere Coinbase operates, apart from New York and the United Kingdom.
Today’s news follows the launch of Dash on Coinbase Pro last week . Coinbase Pro is designed for institutional clients—an exchange where users can trade crypto between each other. On Coinbase.com, retail customers can buy crypto instantly, directly from Coinbase itself.
“Dash’s listing on Coinbase represents a significant expansion in access for users, as tens of millions of people have accounts with the exchange,” Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, told Decrypt.
Dash’s main priority is payments and e-commerce. It offers lower transaction fees than credit cards, and, unlike its slower brethren Bitcoin , settles transactions quickly.
And it turns out people actually use the thing: Dash’s volume hit over $350 million in the past 24 hours, and thousands of merchants across the world accept it, including Overstock.com. It’s also recently signed deals with a bunch of ATM operators, who operate around 1,000 Dash-friendly ATMs worldwide.
Dash is “proof that crypto can be a more viable alternative to fiat,” Joël Valenzuela, director of community outreach at Dash, told Decrypt earlier this month.
