Earlier today, the Jackson County Board of Supervisors unveiled a new challenge course and 40-yard dash at the West Jackson County Soccer Complex.
Both the 40-yard dash and the challenge course which includes seven elements have timing systems to allow individuals to race one another or strive for a personal best.
The challenge course was designed by Compton Engineering and constructed by Greater Gulf Development.
Jackson County Recreation Director Darcie Crew said, “We really since we started here with soccer, and it’s based in athletics, this complex is, that we really wanted to showcase, you know, do more for healthy Mississippi. And so the long term plan has several physical elements in it and this was the first phase. So this challenge course was just sort of, you know, we wanted to do something new and different, not just your standard fitness equipment, not just your standard playground equipment, but we wanted to give the kids and adults alike something that they can come and enjoy and have a great workout at any time they wanted to.”
The West Jackson County Soccer Complex also unveiled its new concession and restroom facility today.
