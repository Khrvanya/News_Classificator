CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (CLARKSVILLENOW) – Rossview girl’s basketball senior guard Ever Walker received a one of a kind graduation gift on Wednesday.
Former WNBA champion and Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie sent a personal message, congratulating Walker on all of her accomplishments.
“This was an awesome gift,” Walker said. “It’s something that I will never forget besides no graduation or no prom. I thought the video was fake at first. I kept pausing it and crying. I felt blessed that she wanted to do this for a 2020 senior…This was God saying that he hasn’t forgot about me.”
CeCe Carson, the owner of Cakes & Sweets by CeCe, was the gift giver responsible for making Walker’s day unforgettable.
