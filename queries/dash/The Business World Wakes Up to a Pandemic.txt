A cascade of announcements marked a turning point in the coronavirus crisis, with ordinary life for many disrupted for the foreseeable future. Businesses and investors are adjusting to this new reality, in which everyday social interactions are altered, travel is restricted and general economic activity is limited — in some cases severely.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic , and said it was “deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.”
• In sounding this alarm “loud and clear,” the agency noted that it hasn’t changed its assessment of the threat, nor did it want to cause “unreasonable fear.”
• It reiterated that countries should be taking “urgent and aggressive” action to contain the virus, noting that it is possible to control it, albeit while “taking a heavy toll on societies and economies.”
President Trump announced a travel ban and stimulus measures.
• Foreigners who have been in the 26 countries of Europe’s Schengen Area in the previous 14 days cannot travel to the U.S. for 30 days. The move will have profound economic consequences .
• The president also pledged aid for workers who are ill or quarantined, an expansion of low-interest loans for small businesses, and tax deferrals.
He mischaracterized some of these policies during his speech: It had to be clarified shortly afterward that the travel ban applied only to people, not goods, as he’d said. This spooked investors, according to Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a research note this morning:
“Markets reacted negatively to what was perceived as a solemn but confused speech that placed blame on other nations, omitted to focus on immediate actions to relieve the most affected individuals, and lacked in concrete fiscal and health measures to address the economic and financial impact of the virus.”
Schools, sporting events and offices shut down.
• The N.B.A. suspension came after a player tested positive , and the N.C.A.A. said that its end-of-season tournament would take place in empty arenas . The fate of other sports leagues , and the Tokyo Olympics , remains up in the air.
• Many companies (including the New York Times) have asked employees to start working remotely.
• In Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by the virus, all shops except pharmacies and grocery stores were ordered closed .
The NYT is providing free access to our most important updates and most useful guidance on the global coronavirus crisis.
After an all-time high just a month ago, a precipitous fall in stocks pushed the Dow into the common definition of a bear market — a 20 percent fall from a recent peak — in record time . The S&P 500 will almost certainly follow today, according to futures , ending the longest bull market in history. It ran just over 11 years.
The volatility has been dizzying, with much sharper swings up and down (mostly down) than usual. A lack of leadership from world governments, the NYT’s Mark Landler writes , is at least partly to blame.
Goldman Sachs thinks things will get worse before they get better. The bank’s chief strategist, David Kostin, forecasts a nearly 30 percent decline in the S&P 500 from its February peak. A counterpoint from Duncan Lamont of Schroders: “Every dollar, euro or pound invested today buys more shares than it would have done a few weeks ago.”
• Ignoring the advice either way, investors are loading up on gold .
The bond market also looks shaky. The huge rally in U.S. government debt during the stock-market swoon has stopped, which some take as a sign that banks are selling bonds to raise cash to offset deteriorating positions in other assets.

Leaders from many of America’s top financial institutions met with President Trump yesterday — though their mission ultimately seemed to be to reassure the president and the markets, rather than talk policy.
Executives projected confidence. Mike Corbat, the C.E.O. of Citigroup, said, “This is not a financial crisis,” according to the WSJ , while Brian Moynihan of Bank of America said that banks were in “a great position.” Several chiefs told Mr. Trump that the economy was the strongest they’d seen in years, according to CNBC’s Kayla Tausche .
Wall Street’s actions in the real world tell another story. Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman appeared in good spirits at the White House meeting, but his firm has advised some of its portfolio companies to pre-emptively draw down their credit lines , according to Bloomberg. In fact, more and more of corporate America is hoarding cash and tapping credit lines just in case .
• U.S. banks had $2.5 trillion in corporate credit lines that hadn’t been drawn down by the end of 2019, according to the F.D.I.C.
Credit drawdowns show how defensive boardrooms are becoming. And while the big banks should be able to tolerate the dash for cash for now, some people are worried: “No one can model this, no one knows where this will end,” Jim Bianco of Bianco Research told Bloomberg.
The other big issue that corporate boards may soon have to confront: If your C.E.O. tests positive for the coronavirus, when do you tell investors?
At the end of last year, nonfinancial companies had borrowed $13.5 trillion, double their debt a decade earlier. According to a recent report from the O.E.C.D. , this debt “has lower overall rating quality, higher payback requirements, longer maturities and inferior investor protection.”
What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for. Most people fall ill five to seven days after exposure, but symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days.
What’s the best material for a mask?
Scientists around the country have tried to identify everyday materials that do a good job of filtering microscopic particles. In recent tests, HEPA furnace filters scored high, as did vacuum cleaner bags, fabric similar to flannel pajamas and those of 600-count pillowcases. Other materials tested included layered coffee filters and scarves and bandannas. These scored lower, but still captured a small percentage of particles.
Is it harder to exercise while wearing a mask?
A commentary published this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine points out that covering your face during exercise “comes with issues of potential breathing restriction and discomfort” and requires “balancing benefits versus possible adverse events.” Masks do alter exercise , says Cedric X. Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise, a nonprofit organization that funds exercise research and certifies fitness professionals. “In my personal experience,” he says, “heart rates are higher at the same relative intensity when you wear a mask.” Some people also could experience lightheadedness during familiar workouts while masked, says Len Kravitz, a professor of exercise science at the University of New Mexico.
I’ve heard about a treatment called dexamethasone. Does it work?
The steroid, dexamethasone, is the first treatment shown to reduce mortality in severely ill patients, according to scientists in Britain. The drug appears to reduce inflammation caused by the immune system, protecting the tissues. In the study, dexamethasone reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third, and deaths of patients on oxygen by one-fifth.
What is pandemic paid leave?
The coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the virus. It gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus. It is the first time the United States has had widespread federally mandated paid leave, and includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But the measure excludes at least half of private-sector workers, including those at the country’s largest employers, and gives small employers significant leeway to deny leave.
Does asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happen?
So far, the evidence seems to show it does. A widely cited paper published in April suggests that people are most infectious about two days before the onset of coronavirus symptoms and estimated that 44 percent of new infections were a result of transmission from people who were not yet showing symptoms. Recently, a top expert at the World Health Organization stated that transmission of the coronavirus by people who did not have symptoms was “very rare,” but she later walked back that statement.
What’s the risk of catching coronavirus from a surface?
Touching contaminated objects and then infecting ourselves with the germs is not typically how the virus spreads. But it can happen. A number of studies of flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus and other microbes have shown that respiratory illnesses, including the new coronavirus, can spread by touching contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like day care centers, offices and hospitals . But a long chain of events has to happen for the disease to spread that way. The best way to protect yourself from coronavirus — whether it’s surface transmission or close human contact — is still social distancing, washing your hands, not touching your face and wearing masks.
How does blood type influence coronavirus?
A study by European scientists is the first to document a strong statistical link between genetic variations and Covid-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus. Having Type A blood was linked to a 50 percent increase in the likelihood that a patient would need to get oxygen or to go on a ventilator, according to the new study.
How many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?
The unemployment rate fell to 13.3 percent in May, the Labor Department said on June 5, an unexpected improvement in the nation’s job market as hiring rebounded faster than economists expected. Economists had forecast the unemployment rate to increase to as much as 20 percent, after it hit 14.7 percent in April, which was the highest since the government began keeping official statistics after World War II. But the unemployment rate dipped instead, with employers adding 2.5 million jobs, after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April.
How can I protect myself while flying?
If air travel is unavoidable, there are some steps you can take to protect yourself. Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people. Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)
What should I do if I feel sick?
If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.
What could go wrong? Energy companies are big issuers of so-called junk bonds, and the plunge in oil prices could make it harder for them to repay these debts, as the NYT’s Peter Goodman explains . Historically low interest rates have also given a wide variety of borrowers a false sense of security — “zombie” companies that have gorged on cheap debt may face a reckoning if lenders refuse refinancings during a virus-induced downturn, writes the FT .
How bad could it get? Moody’s expects defaults on junk bonds to rise, but even its worst-case scenario envisions a smaller spike in the share of bad debt than during the 2008 financial crisis. That said, given the recent borrowing binge, even a lower rate of defaults than during the global financial crisis could mean a similar absolute number of junk-rated companies reneging on debts.
