The driver of the transport truck didn't seem to notice the other vehicle in the lane he was entering.
If you spend anytime behind the wheel you will likely have seen your fair share of close-calls and questionable decisions by your fellow drivers.
A Kamloops Twitter user got a bit of both in Salmon Arm when a transport truck made a lane change in an intersection and nearly sideswiped their vehicle.
The incident was caught by their dash cam and the video was shared on Twitter.
You can see the transport truck switch lanes in the middle of an intersection, which ICBC recommends against doing .
Luckily, the driver with the dash cam quickly assessed the situation and slowed down to avoid an accident.
In Kamloops, there’s a YouTube account dedicated to the bad drivers in Kamloops and maybe this one will make the cut for the next instalment.
