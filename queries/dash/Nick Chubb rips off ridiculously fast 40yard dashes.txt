Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb may be in the best shape of his life heading into the 2020 NFL season. Rusty Mansell, 247Sports and Dawgs247 recruiting analyst, reported that Chubb ripped off multiple 40-yard dash times in the 4.3-second range Tuesday morning .
“In his last testing session before the season was told that [Chubb] ran a pair of 4.3 40s on multiple watches this morning,” Mansell tweeted. “This is the fastest he has been timed. Fantasy owners you can thank me later.”
Zach Chubb, Nick’s brother, responded to Mansell’s tweet by posting two pictures of stopwatches indicating that Nick ran 4.31 seconds and 4.32 seconds.

Chubb has always had rare speed for his size. He set a school record in the 100-meter dash in high school, then — after rushing for 1,000 or more yards in three seasons at Georgia despite suffering a gruesome injury — ran 4.52 seconds in the 40-yard dash at 227 pounds. But his vertical jump (38.5 inches) showed his probably had more explosiveness in the tank, and it has shown up on the field at the NFL level.
Cleveland took Chubb early in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft, making him the 35th overall pick. He played in all 16 games, starting nine of them and just missing the 1,000-yard mark with 996 yards and eight touchdowns, including one from 92 yards out.
And while the Browns were a mess as a team in 2019, Chubb was terrific. He rushed for 1,494 yards and eight touchdowns while averaging 5.0 yards per carry. That number is especially impressive given that more than 75 percent of those yards came after first contact. Chubb also ranked second in the NFL in broken tackles, only behind Carolina's Christian McCaffrey .
That led to Chubb's first Pro Bowl, and led CBS Sports writer Patrik Walker to name Chubb as the NFL's fifth-best running back .
“Like Gurley, Chubb is a former Georgia Bulldog who has proven he can dominate at the NFL level as a runner and a receiver -- landing honors as a Pro Bowler in his first season as a full-time starter,” Walker wrote.
The only running backs ahead of him, in order, were McCaffrey, Ezekiel Elliott , Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry.
The No. 5 running back and No. 33 overall player in the 247Sports Composite, Chubb earned first-team All-SEC honors at Georgia when he rushed for 1,547 yards and 14 touchdowns as a true freshman. His sophomore year saw him on pace for another big year with 747 yards and seven touchdowns through six games before he was injured against Tennessee. But Chubb showed his fight in returning in a major way, rushing for 1,130 yards and eight touchdowns in his junior year, then hitting 1,345 yards and 15 scores as Georgia reached the national championship game his senior season.
