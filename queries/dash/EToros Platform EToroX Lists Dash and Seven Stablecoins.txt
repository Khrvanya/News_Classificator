EToroX, the digital asset platform of social trading platform eToro, announced the listing of privacy coin Dash and seven stablecoins in a press release published on Nov. 12.
Per the release, eToroX users can now also trade stablecoins backed by the Turkish Lira (TRYX), Polish Zloty (PLNX), South African Rand (ZARX) and Hong Kong Dollar (HKDX) alongside U.S. dollar-backed tokens USDC and Tether ( USDT ).  The addition brings the number of assets tradeable on the cryptocurrency exchange up to 26. Doron Rosenblum, managing director at eToroX, commented:
“We see the addition of USDC and USDT as a way for eToroX to further meet the needs of professional and institutional algo traders, particularly in the Asian markets. Adding five new stablecoins, plus the addition of the Dash cryptoasset, demonstrates our ongoing commitment to bridge the gap between the world of blockchain and traditional financial markets.”
The exchange also listed a new pair allowing its users to trade tokenized gold (GOLDX) against Bitcoin ( BTC ). The firm cites that gold is seen by many as a safe-haven asset, while Bitcoin is seen as its digital counterpart. Rosenblum explained:
“Our Gold/Bitcoin pair provides a means to trade between the old and the new stores of value, making Gold/BTC an extremely special and interesting combination.”
As Cointelegraph reported in mid-October, eToro has partnered with analytics and finance management startup The Tie to launch a sentiment-based analytical tool to track people’s perception of cryptocurrencies.
