The Rotary Club of Arlington’s Board of Directors made the determination to cancel its Great Stilly Dusk Dash event on the Fourth of July for 2020.
“Each Fourth, the Duck Dash brings crowds of people to Haller Park,” said Duck Dash Chairperson Devin Brossard. “Following the cancellation of the Fourth of July Parade and other activities in Arlington, we felt that the best decision for the health and safety of our community this year was to forego this year’s annual fundraiser.”
The Rotary Club of Arlington has many business partners that sponsor the event each summer. Last year, the Club dedicated half of all sponsorship funds raised to go to scholarships to graduating students from Arlington, Darrington and Lakewood - $60,000 was just awarded to graduates. This year, several local business partners that had committed sponsorships to the event have agreed to put all of those funds towards scholarships for 2021 graduates – totaling $46,000 so far. These donors are:νDwayne Lanes - $10,000
