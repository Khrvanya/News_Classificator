'So I used my best judgement and decided that I was not going to be able to put up with these passengers for the 45-plus-minute trip and proceeded to drop them back off to their house and they didn't seem to happy about that, as you will see in the video.'
His decision is made final when he suspects the male passenger in the seat behind him of using a weed pen in his car.
But the woman in the front seat denies this.
The driver says 'I know what a weed pen is, okay', to which the woman hits back: 'Normally, like, Ubers are pretty cool with that.'
After an attempted negotiation from the woman, the man explains that unlike some drivers he is willing to drop them back off at their house, rather than on the side of the road.
Another in the back-middle seat adds as she gets out the car: 'Maybe if you hadn't been speeding you wouldn't be pulled over and you wouldn't be such a f***ing bulls*** [inaudible].'
The driver pulls away and appears to turn his radio back on to his preferred channel.

He speaks to the camera: 'You see this guys, this is the kind of sh** we have to deal with as Uber drivers.'
'There's no respect, no respect whatsoever, why should I take them, why should I take them, you know?'
He adds: 'This is another reason I have a dashcam, to record everything because if I didn't have this dashcam they're going to report me to Uber and Uber might deactivate me.
