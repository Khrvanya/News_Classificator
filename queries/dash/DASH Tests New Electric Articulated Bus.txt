Alexandria's bus service is slowly working toward a zero-emissions fleet.
A number of residents have reported seeing a big, blue articulated ("accordion") bus on a few DASH bus routes in the past week.
As part of the continued commitment to move toward a zero-emissions fleet, DASH is testing and demonstrating the Xcelsior CHARGE XE60 bus through this Wednesday, Feb. 12.
The bus is being loaned to Alexandria free of charge and is running on select DASH bus routes.
DASH is inviting the community to ask questions and take a ride on the bus on Feb. 12 from 4 - 6 p.m. at Market Square in front of City Hall, 301 King Street.
This 60-foot bus is manufactured and furnished by New Flyer of America. It is the first battery electric articulated bus DASH has demonstrated, and it has the highest battery storage capacity of any zero-emissions bus ever demonstrated in Alexandria.
Special turning technology allows the bus to navigate all future and current routes in Alexandria, as the bus has a tighter turn radius than current DASH buses. The buses hold 120 to 130 people each.
DASH has a small set of older-model articulated buses, but buses are scheduled to be retired from active service soon.
