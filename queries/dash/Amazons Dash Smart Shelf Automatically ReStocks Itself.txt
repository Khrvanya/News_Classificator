Never run out of printer paper or coffee cups at the office again.
As TechCrunch reports , Amazon is set to offer business customers the choice of a small (7-by-7 inches), medium (12-by-10 inches), or large (18-by-13 inches) smart shelf. You plug it in (or use four AAA batteries), connect it to the Amazon app over Wi-Fi, and then select a product type and quantity to store on it. The shelf has a built-in scale so it can track how much of a product is left and automatically order a new supply when necessary, or at the very least inform a member of staff stock is running low.
It's a very simple idea, but an effective one for consumables businesses are always running out of because someone forgets to go out and buy some more. For Amazon, it works because it ties smart scale owners in to re-purchasing directly and without any human interaction required beyond setting up the re-ordering process.
While it is very simple and easy to setup, the Dash Smart Shelf is also quite limited. It looks as though you can only place one type of product on it at a time, meaning you'll require multiple shelves for all regularly consumed products. Amazon has a lot of intelligent hardware it can call upon to solve this problem, so why use a simple scale when it could instead create a Dash Smart Camera to monitor a location for lots of products at once? Maybe that's going to appear in the future...
For now, the Dash Smart Shelf is yet to be released and Amazon is running a pilot trial this month. Business customers in the US can sign up to receive an email when Amazon decides on a launch date, which is expected to be at some point next year.
