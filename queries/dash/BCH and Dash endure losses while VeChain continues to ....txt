The start of May did not go as planned for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin halving’s pre-effect was supposed to result in the coins’ bull run, however, things turned out differently. While Bitcoin Cash and Dash are struggling amid losses, VeChain surprisingly is maintaining an upward trend at the moment.
Bitcoin Cash , following the significant gains at the beginning of April, recorded a 17% rise on April 23 and trended upwards throughout the month, but met with a sudden drop on May 1 and saw another drop on May 10 by 12%. Since then the coin has been trying to rise back to its key resistance level [$265]. The coin saw a negligible uptrend on May 24, however, the CMF indicator which rests below the zero line hints at a continued downward breakout.
On the development end, the Bitcoin Cash network recently completed another upgrade adding a few new features to the blockchain. The new upgrade is told to bring opcode support, a chain limit extension, and the improved counting of signature operations using the new “Sigchecks” implementation.
