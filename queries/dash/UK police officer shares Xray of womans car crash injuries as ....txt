A UK police officer has shared an image of a woman’s dramatic injury after a car crash, as a warning to passengers to stop putting their feet on a car’s dashboard.
The image, posted by Sergeant Ian Price, is an X-ray of a woman’s lower body, showing her crushed hips and thighs after a crash.
“Here is an X-ray of horrific injuries sustained to the front seat passenger who had their feet on the dashboard at the time of a collision,” Price wrote.
“If you see your passenger doing it, stop driving and show them this.”
The unidentified woman suffered a broken hip, while the other was completely dislocated.
Social media users were quick to share their horror at the post.
“I am 60 and have put feet on dash many times in my life,” one person said.
