The Winston-Salem Dash (High A; Carolina League) has unveiled a new primary logo, marking a major change to the club’s look ahead of the 2020 season.
The new logo features an intertwined and curved “W” and “S”, with the letters outlined in Dash purple and filled in with white. The new-look reflects Winston-Salem and the team’s ties to the Chicago White Sox, the Dash’s parent club. The new logo will be featured on all jerseys and the hats for the Dash.
“We are excited to share our new logo with the community,” said Dash Team President C.J. Johnson. “We feel like this new look ties in the great history of professional baseball in Winston-Salem, while having a fresh look for the future.”
“The new Dash logo is the perfect addition to our community’s identity. Winston-Salem is a city that’s reinventing itself, but still staying true to its history, and the Dash logo reflects that with its modern classic design. I think it’s a home run!” said Mark Owens, the President and CEO of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce.
Merchandise with the Dash’s new logo is now available at wsdash.com or by calling the Dash office and lining up a time to visit the Hanes Team Store.
