Videon has worked with NexPlayer, AWS Elemental MediaStore, and Amazon CloudFront to produce two workflow reports that simplify user’s low latency live streaming experience. When these workflows are implemented, the user can expect to achieve <3 second worldwide latency in scale. Plus, device synchronization can be achieved to ensure everyone is seeing content at the same time.
The company produced a report that focuses on creating low cost, low latency, HTTP streaming workflows using AWS, and NexPlayer with their EdgeCaster encoder. In this report, Videon validates and measures the latency using the NexPlayer player application on different platforms (phones, tablets, and browsers) when video is encoded by Videon’s EdgeCaster, ingested by AWS MediaStore, delivered by AWS CloudFront, and played back via NexPlayer player technology.
The goal of the report is to clearly identify end to end workflow compatibility along with measuring the expected latency for different workflows.
The next report that Videon produced focused on validating and documenting the process of setting up and configuring a workflow for HTTP Streaming using AWS services as well as identifying the expected results. The company also laid out configuration instructions so users can follow step-by-step instructions and have success when setting up an HTTP streaming workflow using EdgeCaster, MediaStore, CloudFront, open source players along with NexPlayer.
