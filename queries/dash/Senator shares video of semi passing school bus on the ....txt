"It's a miracle a kid hasn't been killed," the senator remarked.
A Minnesota senator recently shared “jaw dropping” dash cam video as a reminder for drivers to pay extra attention around school buses.
On February 25, Senator Scott Newman shared a dash cam of an incident that occurred near Paynesville, Minnesota in 2014. The same video clip was aired during a recent Minnesota Senate Transportation Finance and Policy Committee meeting on school bus safety.
“It’s a miracle a kid hasn’t been killed,” Newman remarked.
During the meeting, Senator Rich Draheim presented a bill to increase public awareness about the dangers of passing a stopped school bus.
According to Senate Republicans, in the past three years, between 1,000 and 1,100 citations were issued annually to drivers who illegally passed a stopped school bus in Minnesota.
