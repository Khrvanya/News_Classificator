Katie Price has shared an update on her eldest son Harvey after he was rushed to hospital on Monday.
In a devastating video of her ''shattered'' son, the former glamour model admitted she "feared the absolute worst" when her 18-year-old son was rushed to hospital after experiencing worrying symptoms when he was struck down with a mystery bug.
Harvey, who suffers from Prader-Willi syndrome, fell ill at his sister Princess' 13th birthday celebrations and Katie, 42, took no chances and called for an ambulance.
The Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins star was deeply concerned for her son who was unable to detail exactly how he was feeling at the time.
Taking to her YouTube channel last night, Katie shared a health update while explaining the ordeal as her shattered son dozed off on the sofa beside her, reports the Mirror .
A sleepy Harvey reassured concerned fans by insisting he now feels good following the dash to hospital.
Laying down in a relaxed position alongside his beloved mum, the teen said: "I feel good, and of course, I am so happy to be home."
