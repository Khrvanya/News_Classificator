Valleyview RCMP are investigating an attempted child luring that occurred at Williamson Park near the boat launch area on Thursday.
At about 8 p.m. that day, a male suspect driving a white ford pick-up truck with black fender flares approached a five-year-old child walking with a 14-year-old teen.
The male then allegedly attempted to lure the five-year-old child into the truck, but the 14-year-old interrupted by taking the five-year-old and fleeing the area and contacting police.
Police are now asking anyone who may have dash cam footage in the Williamson Park Road boat launch area or Williamson Park area between 4 p.m. until dark on Thursday to contact the Valleyview RCMP at 780-524-3345.
Those with information regarding this incident are also encouraged to contact this number.
