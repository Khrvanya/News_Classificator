As The Nest get closer to its finale, things take a dramatic turn in episode three with a dramatic dash to the hospital.
Last week saw Kaya (Mirren Mack) get closer to Jack (Samuel Small) and their newfound romance looks set to continue.
Pictures from the upcoming episode show Kaya all dressed up and meeting Jack what could be their first date.
She looks happy to see him, so maybe her feelings towards him are serious and now out of boredom, but you never know with Kaya.
But while it looks to be going well between the pair, a shock incident is set to take place which leads Emily (Sophie Rundle) and Dan (Martin Compston) to make a mad dash to the hospital.
Kaya is seen being carted into hospital on a stretcher as Jack looks on worried stood next to the ambulance.

His dad Callum (Bailey Patrick) is also there to comfort his son as they wait for news from whoever has been wheeled inside.
There may be a bit of a showdown at the hospital too, as James (James Harkness) arrives and has to be held back by a police officer.
It was also revealed in the previous episode that Kaya had in fact murdered a pregnant woman when she was a child.

Dan had discovered her secret after some digging (by some not-exactly-above-board means) and told his sister-in-law Hilary (Fiona Bell) and what he learned.
Ominously, Hilary suggested that it wasn’t too late for Dan to get Kaya and the baby out of their lives – but what did she mean?
The Nest continues tonight at 9pm on BBC One.
