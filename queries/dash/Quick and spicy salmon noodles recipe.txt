Measure your onion into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the ginger and garlic, and pour over the coconut milk. Crumble in the stock cube and add the curry powder, chilli and pepper.
Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer. Drain the salmon and tip into the saucepan, or stir in the salmon paste. Stir well to combine, then cover and cook on a vigorous simmer for 4 minutes.
Add the noodles and the edamame or peas and replace the lid. Continue to cook for 6 minutes at a slightly less vigorous simmer, then turn off the heat. Allow to stand for a few minutes for the sauce to thicken as it cools and the noodles continue to cook in the residual steam.
Serve with a dash of lemon or lime juice and extra black pepper, to taste.
