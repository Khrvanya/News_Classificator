Google is offering users a fun way to commemorate the anniversary of a cinematic classic. August 25 is the 80th anniversary of The Wizard of Oz.
The Wizard of Oz landed on the big screen in 1939. Judy Garland starred as Dorothy Gale, a girl from Kansas with dreams of traveling “somewhere over the rainbow”. After a run in between Dorothy’s dog Toto and a cruel neighbor, Dorothy finds herself transported to a magical world by way of a tornado.
To see the Google activity, open a Google window and search “The Wizard of Oz”. Results seem typical at first. Until you see the sparkling red slippers.
Click on the slippers and you’re tossed into the black and white world of a search page far, far away. To return to technicolor on the other side of the rainbow, just click on the twister. Whoosh, you’re back.
The Wizard of Oz was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning two for Best Original Song, “Over the Rainbow”, and Best Original Score by Herbert Stothart. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, but lost to Gone with the Wind.
