Cardinia Highway Patrol officers are appealing for dash-cam footage following a multi-vehicle collision in Bunyip yesterday.
Police have been told a Ford tray ute was travelling west along the Princes Freeway between Hope Street and Martin Road about 6.25pm.
It is believed the ute hit a tyre on the road and became airborne before spinning around.
Two other vehicles, a grey station wagon and a black Toyota Prado, tried to avoid the vehicle when they collided.
Three people inside the ute were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Investigators are keen to speak to any witnesses or anyone who may have seen a vehicle lose a wheel.
