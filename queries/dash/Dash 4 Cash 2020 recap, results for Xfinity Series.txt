The Dash 4 Cash initiative for NASCAR Xfinity Series wrapped up on June 28 at Pocono Raceway with the final installment in the four-race series for the 2020 season. Ross Chastain nabbed the prize for his second $100,000 bonus in the 2020 campaign.
The program opened with a qualifying race June 1 at Bristol Motor Speedway and then the first money race June 6 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Noah Gragson took home the $100,000 at Atlanta. AJ Allmendinger took home the $100,000 at Miami. Chastain took the $100,000 prize home at Talladega.
How it works is the first of the four Dash 4 Cash competitors to finish in a race in the program will win the $100,000 bonus. The winner and the next three highest finishing Xfinity Series drivers (who have declared for points in that series) will qualify for the next event.
In addition to the payout to drivers, Xfinity plans to make donations in each Dash 4 Cash race market that reaffirms its companywide commitment of connecting families, veterans and seniors to the digital tools necessary for navigating these challenging times.
