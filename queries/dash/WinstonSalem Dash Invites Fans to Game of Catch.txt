WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- Coronavirus may have forced the Winston-Salem Dash off the field but there was still a lot of action this weekend.
On Saturday, the team invited young fans and their parents to play catch.
Pairs signed up for one-hour time slots to toss the ball around at the newly renamed Truist Stadium.
All baseballs were sanitized in between sessions to keep everyone safe.
The team's vice president says it's a way for families to experience the camaraderie of baseball, even while the season is on hold.
"Baseball brings us together in tough times like we're in and certainly to have an opportunity to just come out and throw the ball is something that people can enjoy, so it's a way to have some fun and enjoy the ball park in tough times. Hopefully, we'll have some baseball soon," says Vice President Corey Bugno.
The Dash is holding other events for the community too.
The next four Mondays they'll serve free hot dogs in a drive-thru at the stadium.
