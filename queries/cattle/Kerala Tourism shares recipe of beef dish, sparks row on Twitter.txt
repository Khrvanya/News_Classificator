Many people claimed that the Kerala Tourism tweet was aimed at hurting religious sentiments since it contained a photo of beef.
Social activist Rahul Easwar asked Kerala Tourism to be culturally sensitive and avoid courting controversy. He questioned the timing of the tweet and pointed out people on Wednesday in other states were celebrating Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Pihu.
“Dear Kerala Tourism, please avoid posting about Pork on Eid & Beef on Makara Sankranthi days. Please be culturally sensitive about special holy days of all faiths. Please showcase our food diversity without offending sensitivities,” he tweeted.
Pls show case our Food diversity without offending sensitivities. https://t.co/MSEiVU2t7z

Cows are considered sacred by Hindus. There are different laws for cow and cattle slaughter in different states. While some states have completely banned it, some haven’t. Kerala is a state where beef consumption is not banned and is among few states that have no law in place on the slaughter of cattle including cow and its progeny.
