Consider it a summer slump when it comes to feeder cattle as volume declines week over week.

Feeder cattle numbers continued their normal seasonal decline with 29,500 head at the test auctions, which was about 6,000 lower than the previous week. Yearling prices were steady to $3 higher on steers, but steady to $3 lower on the heifers. Calf prices were also lower with very small volume at most sales.
There was a bigger run of cows with 7,300 head at the test auctions, but several of these were replacement cows, so there was actually smaller numbers in slaughter cows. The slaughter cow prices were $1-2 higher even though the cow meat prices dropped lower.
