Operation Cow Thief is putting up some big numbers for information leading to the arrest or indictment of those responsible for taking 262 head of cattle from the Bill Merydith Ranch, February 18, 2020. The ranch is based in Lipscomb County in Perryton, Texas.
Rancher Bob Adcock put up $10,000 of his own money, to go with the $1,000 offered through the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association (TSCRA). The animals, both steers and heifers, were between 500 and 550 pounds each. Most are black, some are red. All are branded with the Lazy 11 on their left shoulder.
Special Ranger Ben Eggleston with the TSCRA says while any theft is hard on the victim, a crime of this magnitude can be devastating. He is asking anyone who knows anything about the theft, or the location of the animals, to come forward and do the right thing.
