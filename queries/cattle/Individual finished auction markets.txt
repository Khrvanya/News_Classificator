Auction markets across Great Britain report their cattle and sheep sales to AHDB throughout the day.
The latest prices and throughputs for finished sales from individual auction markets are updated on this page and are shown under each market’s day of sale.
For additional information please see here.
Finished cattle are sold individually and auction markets provide the breed, sex category, date of birth, price, weight and farm assured information for each beast sold liveweight.
Prime cattle are classed as heifers or steers under 30 months and bulls under 24 months of age.
Finished sheep are normally sold in batches and the auction markets provide the age category, price, weight and farm assured information for every lot sold liveweight.
Prime sheep are reported as new season lambs (clean sheep from this year’s crop) or old season lambs (clean sheep from last year’s crop) sometimes referred to as hoggs or hoggets. The Standard Quality Quotation is an industry standard weight band for prime live sheep between 25.5kg and 45.5kg.
