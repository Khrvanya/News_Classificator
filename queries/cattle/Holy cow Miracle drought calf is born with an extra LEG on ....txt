A grazier has shared a photo of a cow she called her 'miracle drought calf' after it was born with a deformed head and an extra leg.
A picture of the male calf posted to the One Day Closer to Rain Facebook page showed leg hanging from the cow's back.
'Wow how interesting! Hopefully he is healthy! What an amazing thing to happen,' one Facebook user wrote.
'I saw a similar one a few years ago during a stock truck rollover. It was full grown and came running out. Everyone stopped to check it out,' another added.
Mrs Culverson said the calf was about a month old and also has a 'bit of a lump' on his head.
One grazier suggested the calf was born with a genetic defect called Development Duplication (DD), also known to as polymelia.
