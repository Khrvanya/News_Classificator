Mississippi Rises to the Top of U.S. Aquaculture
Mississippi leads the country in catfish production.
Agriculture continues to be Mississippi’s top industry for revenue generated in the Magnolia State. Poultry is Mississippi’s largest agricultural commodity, leading as the most valuable livestock product including eggs-layers with sales valued at $3.1 billion. The 2017 Census of Agriculture showed that producers raised and sold $6.2 billion in crops and livestock.
Aquaculture is an important commodity for the state. Mississippi’s aquaculture has risen back to the top, ranking first in the U.S. with $230.7 million in sales. Known for farm-raised catfish, Mississippi boasts 205 catfish farms with sales valued at $219.7 million.
Mississippi’s most valuable crops are cotton and soybean, ranked fourth and sixteenth respectively, in the nation in 2017. The state also grows substantial quantities of corn for grain, rice, and sweet potatoes. Most of the cropland can be found in the Mississippi Delta area of the state.
The 2017 Census of Agriculture showed that Mississippi had almost 10.4 million acres of farmland, down 5 percent from 2012. The average size of farm increased to 298 acres, up 4 percent from 2012. Our farmers generated a significant amount in market value of agricultural products sold in 2017.
From cattle to catfish, poultry to peanuts, agriculture continues to help Mississippi maintain a leading economy. Our state will continue to rise to the top as long as we keep producing those valuable agriculture products.
