Feeder cattle enthusiasts, pour your coffee strong this week! With two of the nation's largest auctions hosting their early summer specialty sales, the feeder cattle market is about to be set.
Northern Livestock Video Auction out of Billings, Montana, will host its early summer special sale of 16,600 head on June 25, and Superior Livestock Auction out of Fort Worth, Texas, is scheduled to host its Big Sky Round-Up sale also on June 25, with 44,900 head available.
There are plenty of burdensome factors on producers' minds this week while trying to pinpoint where prices will land. Throughout much of the country, the need for a good rain is vital to the longevity of summer pastures. Fat cattle prices have weakened over the last two weeks and are bound to continue to erode as boxed beef prices scale lower. Last Friday's Cattle on Feed report sorely reminded us just how many cattle weren't moved and marketed throughout May, which continues to pressure today's market. All of these factors weigh heavily on the feeder cattle market, putting immense stress on producers throughout the country.
Regardless of where this week's market lands, knowing the benchmark for this year's early sales and what may be expected for autumn sales is comforting. As the saying goes, "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know."
