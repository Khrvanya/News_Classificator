It was a similar message coming out of Ruralco (ASX:RHL), saying it expects to deliver an underlying full-year profit of up to $29 million.
In May the company warned investors that the dry conditions could potentially shape profit in the second half.
Similar to Elders, it said a buoyant wool and sheep market had helped to offset the impact from decreases in cattle prices.
“Our focus in the fourth quarter is supporting our customers through this challenging cycle,” chief Travis Dillon said.
The severity of the drought varied across the country “and hence its impact will vary depending upon location, animal type and weight”, Wellard said in its annual report out last month
“In general, drought conditions result in a herd liquidation during which prices reduce and are then followed by a herd rebuild as growing conditions improve, during which prices increase.”
The current “liquidation” phase had helped increase live export volumes in recent months. Heavier, “ready-for-processing” cattle had a higher value during this phase.
If the drought worsened, the price of lighter cattle “may reduce and become more attractive for customers in Indonesia who prefer feeder cattle”, Wellard said.
But “customers in countries which import heavy “ready for processing” cattle, such as in Vietnam and China, may be forced to pay higher prices.
