US livestock futures rose on Friday as the market tried to recover from its steep discount to the cash market.
According to reporting from Reuters , strong demand from consumers at grocery stores due to coronavirus fears underpinned the gains.
"They want to have as much meat on hand right now," said Craig VanDyke, senior risk manager at Top Third Ag Marketing . "They are going to try to keep up with this situation."
Futures sold off sharply early in the week on concerns about a slowdown in demand from restaurants. But the cash market remained strong as consumers emptied shelves at grocery stores.
CME May feeder cattle futures contract, trading with expanded limits of 6.75 cents, settled up 5.225 cents at 118.250 cents per lb.
CME June live cattle futures were 0.6 cent higher at 89.525 cents per lb.
After the market closed on Friday, the USDAâ€™s monthly report stated that the amount of cattle on feed as of 1 March was 100 percent of a year earlier. Placements during February were 92 percent of February 2019 placements and marketings were 105 percent of a year earlier.
The figures were in line with market expectations.
