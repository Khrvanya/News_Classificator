In what police are calling an act of "udder"Â mischief, 71 cows worth about $100,000 are on the loose from a farm in Hagar and are still missing.
Sometime between Sept. 6 and Sept. 16, an unknown culprit or culprits disassembled the gate of a cattle farm on North Central Road in Hagar. It's not known if the mischief was over a prior beef or simply an act of vandalism.
