A TRIP overseas earlier this month certainly came with some challenges, due to the coronavirus outbreak, yet the experience is one Helen De Costa values. Helen De Costa, who works for H Francis and Co in Wagga, represented Australia at the World Hereford Conference in New Zealand. She was a member of the Australian "white team" in the young breeders competition.  This team earned the champion module team, reserve champion in clipping and reserve champion in the quiz.  In addition Helen was third overall in the paraders competition.  Helen, was in self-isolation this week to meet the government's COVID-19 requirements, however, she spoke to The Rural over the phone and corresponded on email.  She said in New Zealand the teams were assessed on judging and parading skills, animal health, agribusiness scenarios, heifer selection, practical farm components and there was also a requirement to do a 10 minute presentation.  The presentation put the participant in "a position of influence" and they had to close the gap between urban and rural communities. "Making global connections and friendships, that will be life long, was valuable," she said.  "I (have) certainly come home more knowledgeable about some of the new technologies that are coming out and evolving within the industry," she said.  "I would definitely recommend this opportunity to any (Hereford) youth member," she said.  Helen said the people and connections made were amazing.  "There's not many opportunities that you get to meet such great and knowledgeable people in that same place at the same time," she said.
