* Feilding saleyards closure puts pressure on stressed, isolated farmers
Sweeney said the livestream format would open up trading to all farmers and complement traditional saleyard and on-farm auctions.
"We have been working on this for some time but the urgency ramped up when we went into the Covid-19 lockdown.
"We have literally worked night and day to bring this to the market as soon as a date for level 3 was announced," he said.
NZ Farmers Livestock will reopen its saleyards when the country moves to Covid-19 alert level 3.
Sweeney said farmers were "under the pump" to move stock, with many coming through a tough drought with lingering impacts.
"Feed and grass is tight on many farms. Winter and dairy changeovers are approaching and this, combined with long processor wait times and recent schedule movements, means there is plenty of demand to get trade moving," he said.
In the leadup to Monday's announcement of the change in alert levels, Federated Farmers sharemilkers chairman Richard McIntyre said lockdown had increased the pressure on meat processing facilities already struggling with additional livestock.
"A lot of farmers don't have enough feed for all their stock and the freezing works would be they usual avenue," McIntyre said.
While there other, mostly digital, ways of trading stock, a lot of farmers preferred more traditional methods and liked seeing the animals in the flesh.
"Also, the sale yards help set the prices for paddock sales, they're a good way to gauge the market and what you're animals are worth."
