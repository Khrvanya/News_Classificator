As the winter is approaching, the Ayodhya Municipal Corporation is all set to provide jute coats to cows staying in different shelters in the city.
“We are in the process of getting the cow coats made. This scheme will be implemented in three-four phases. First, we are starting with Baishingpur cow shelter, which houses around 1,200 cattle, including 700 bulls and the rest being cows and calves. We have initially placed an order for 100 cow coats for the calves,” Hindustan Times quoted Niraj Shukla, Nagar Nigam Commissioner of Ayodhya, as saying. The first delivery of the coats that costs ₹250-300 each will arrive in November, added Shukla.
“Three-layer coats for the calves are being prepared. We have asked for the use of soft clothes for the calves in the innermost layer apart from the jute which provides warmth to the body,” he said.
The coats for bulls and cows will have separate designs. While the cows will have two layers, the bulls will have coats made only of jute.
“The cow shelter will also have a bonfire to save the cows from extreme cold. Paddy straw will be put on the floor to provide warmth to the cattle if they choose to sit,” he added.
Talking about the initiative, Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay said, “Our focus is on the service of cows. We are developing other cow shelters also and will make them the best in the state.”
While the cows are being protected from cold, no such initiative is on the table for human beings. In 2018, as many as 143 people died due to a severe cold wave in Uttar Pradesh. Deaths were reported from Kanpur, Fatehpur, Kannauj, Pilibhit, Moradabad, Sambhal, Amroha, Rampur, Hamirpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur and Ballia, reported Deccan Chronicle .
In Delhi, the biting cold claimed 103 lives by January 2019. In 2018, nearly 1,400 people died due to extreme weather events, including heavy rains and subsequent flooding, dust storms, thunderstorms and lightning.
