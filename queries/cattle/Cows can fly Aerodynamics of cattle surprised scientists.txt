Scientists in the study decided to calculate the aerodynamics of cattle. Also, experts have found, can the cow fly.
The author of the study physicist Robin Bornhoff. In the process they have used 3D CAD model of a cow, as well as a special program FloEFD. Recently created in order to help with the solution of problems affecting the question of heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Using were able to establish a lifting force, as well as the average resistance of the specified animal, taking into account the different wind intensity and direction. In the end it turned out that potentially a cow could fly. However, this wind speed must reach about 1.2 thousand km/h. In the event of a hurricane in such “bursts” the animal would have just blew. If it fasten in a fixed position, there is a risk that cattle will be torn apart.
A physicist has calculated that the take-off speed characteristic of the cow is several times the speed of sound. If we assume that an animal will movement with hypersonic speed, there would be the opportunity to observe the “interesting” effects on aerodynamics.
