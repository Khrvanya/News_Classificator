This survey aims to provide a weekly overview of the prices paid for deadweight cattle for the most common classifications on the EUROP grid, collected from a sample of abattoirs across Great Britain.
For additional information please see here.
All abattoirs in Great Britain slaughtering more than 20,000 adult cattle each year contribute to this survey. The data is collected weekly and published by Wednesday for the previous week (Sunday to Saturday). Each plant provides the price and weight as well as the fat class and conformation of each individual steer, heifer, young bull or cow procured deadweight.
The prices shown are in pence per kilogram and based on a UK dressing specification. They include all animals slaughtered regardless of scheme, breed or organic status and represent the average payable for the animal upon delivery to the abattoir, before deductions (e.g. procurement, transport, insurance, inspection, levy).
The ‘Overall Price‘ and ‘Numbers‘ shown include all classifications on the EUROP grid, with the red and green figures referring to the price and throughput change on the week.
