Invest in cattle and 'earn between 13% and 15%'. Got R500? No farming required
"A genius idea! You just invest; they raise the cattle for you," says personal finance journalist Maya Fisher-French.
If the current coronavirus crisis has taught us anything it is to make sure our investments are diversified.
In other words, never have all your eggs in one basket.
“Diversification” usually refers to investing in funds that hold South African and offshore shares, property, bonds, cash or gold.
To achieve proper diversification, many investors may choose to also invest in “non-financial assets” or actual, physical assets.
Popular examples include things such as beehives, blueberries and solar energy through Fedgroup Impact Farming (some people may remember its TV ads featuring a comically self-aware David Hasselhoff ).
One more example is SV Capital which allows South Africans to invest in cattle for as little as R500 a month.
The fund has delivered a return of 15.58% per annum - net of fees - since its start in 2017.
