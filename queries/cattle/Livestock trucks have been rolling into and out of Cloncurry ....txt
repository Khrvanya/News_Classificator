It has been full steam ahead over the past few months for brothers Dustin and Nathan Keyes who manage the Cloncurry Cattle Clearing and Transit Facility, on behalf of the Cloncurry Shire Council.
The north west Queensland town is ideally situated for the transportation of livestock and it is one of the major cattle processing hubs in the state.
Following widespread rainfall to the south and in NSW, northern and Gulf producers have been taking advantage of good market opportunities.
Producers who were hard hit by the 2019 flood event had restocked and are now offloading cattle, which has been advantageous in producing cash flow.
There has also been significant movement of backgrounders and feedlotters, and also company cattle returning to their other properties in north west Queensland and the Northern Territory.
Since the season stated in early April, the brothers have processed 125,000 head, including 55,000 head in May alone.
Nathan Keyes said that since the good rains arrived earlier this year, the trucks have been rolling into and out of the complex almost non-stop - and in all directions.
"We have had cattle from Western Australia and the Northern Territory, heading into south west Queensland and into NSW," Mr Keyes said.
"The cattle heading north are bound for the live export market, or returning home to the Barkly Tableland after being away on agistment during the drought."
Mr Keyes said the condition and quality of cattle was both pleasing and surprising given that breeders had been coming out of extremes of weather in the past 12 months.
The Cloncurry facility processes 250,000 cattle annually on average.
"The month of June has been a pretty big month for us as well, and we haven't done a tally yet, but are certainly on track to break that record," Mr Keyes said.
