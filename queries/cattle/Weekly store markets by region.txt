This survey is a key indicator of store auction market sales across Great Britain.  Price and throughput information of store cattle and sheep, as well as dairy cattle and rearing calves are available regionally.
For additional information please see here.
These reports are normally updated every Monday afternoon for the previous week.
Store cattle and rearing calves are sold either individually or in batches and auction markets provide the breed, sex category, date of birth, and price information for every animal sold in the store ring.
Sold sheep are normally sold in batches and the auction markets provide the age category and price information for every lot sold.
Store sheep are reported as new season lambs (clean sheep from this year’s crop) or old season lambs (clean sheep from last year’s crop) sometimes referred to as hoggs or hoggets.
