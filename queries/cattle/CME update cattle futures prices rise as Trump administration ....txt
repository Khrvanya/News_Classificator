US live cattle futures rose on 8 May along with cash prices as the US government probed the beef market.
Cash prices rose to $115 and $116 for cattle from $110 on Thursday and $95 earlier in the week, helping support futures, said Rich Nelson, chief strategist for commodity broker Allendale .
Cash prices had previously suffered as the coronavirus pandemic slowed operations at some slaughterhouses and temporarily closed others, leaving ranchers nowhere to ship their cattle .
Retailers like Kroger and Costco have limited sales of some meat items as a result, and wholesale boxed beef prices and margins for beef processors have climbed.
"I think packers are saying, 'We have to give back a little bit of this margin,'" Nelson said.
Beef processor Cargill said allegations of price-fixing lack merit.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) June live cattle futures rose 0.675 cents to 94.650 cents per pound. The market's daily limit will revert to its standard of 3 cents on Monday after temporarily expanding to 4.5 cents on Friday, the exchange said.
August feeder cattle futures fell 1.2 cents to 136.950 cents per pound.
