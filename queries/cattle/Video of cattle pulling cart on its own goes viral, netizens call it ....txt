A video of a cattle pulling a cart on its own has gone viral on social media. The video was shared by MP Parvesh Sahib Singh on Twitter.
In the video, the cattle can be seen pulling the cart without the guidance of its owner. It bends down to wear the handle of the cart on its neck and then begins to pull it. It seems familiar with the work as it smoothly carries out the steps and walks ahead.
"Mesmerising," the video is captioned.

Last year, a video of a cow playing gully football had gone viral. In the video, a group of boys were seen playing football in a field. When the ball landed near the cow, it decided to join the game.
The animal walked around the field while kicking the ball and pushing it with its nose. Soon after, the boys managed to get the ball back. The cow then tracked their passes and got the ball back.
