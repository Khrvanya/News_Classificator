SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) will host junior livestock and horse shows providing Illinois’ youth with an opportunity to show their animals during an unprecedented show season.
The Junior Livestock Expo will take place in Springfield over the course of two weekends in September. Beef, sheep, dairy goats, pygmy goats and rabbits will all show September 11-13. Swine, dairy cattle and meat goats will have their turn in the show ring on September 18-20.
A Junior Horse Show will take place on the Du Quoin State Fairgrounds. The show will run for two weekends on the Du Quoin State Fairgrounds, with English showing August 29-30 and Western September 5-6.
“After the cancellations of the Illinois and Du Quoin State Fairs we knew there was a need to recognize our junior exhibitors who work year round preparing for the fairs,” said Jerry Costello II, Acting IDOA Director. “We are excited to provide modified shows that will provide an opportunity for young adults to exhibit their animals safely following the Restore Illinois plan.”
Shows are limited to Illinois residents between the ages of 8-21. The entry fee for those participating in the Junior Horse Show is $10. Junior Livestock Entry Fees are as follows:
