The heart-breaking scene was filmed by one of the workers, who then uploaded the clip onto Chinese messaging app WeChat.
According to Guangdong TV , it is likely that the cow had got pregnant, prompting it to have a stronger desire to live.
After the video was widely shared, many animal lovers called the boss of the slaughterhouse in a bid to save the cow.
Good Samaritans donated 24,950 yuan (£2,732) to buy the animal alive and then released it to a local Buddhist temple, Mr Lin added.

A separate clip shows some of the kind strangers driving a truck to pick up the cow after the slaughterhouse agreed to sell it to them.
The cow knelt again in an apparent gesture to thank its saviours. According to Sina.com , it kept the posture for as long as one minute in front of the driver after arriving at the temple.
The animal has been adopted by the Golden Lion Temple in Jieyang. Donors have given the temple 4,000 yuan (£438) to cover its expenses.
