This survey aims to provide a weekly reference price for deadweight prime sheep on the EUROP classification grid that fall within the SQQ weight band.  The prices are collected from a sample of abattoirs across Great Britain.
The table below shows the latest new season lamb prices from week ending 23 May onwards.
The AHDB deadweight sheep price series is collected from a voluntary sample of abattoirs in Great Britain. The data is collected weekly and published every Wednesday for the previous week (Sunday to Saturday). Abattoirs submit the price, weight, fat class and conformation of all their prime sheep procured deadweight, regardless of scheme, breed or organic status. The prices shown are in pence per kilogram and represent the average payable for the animal upon delivery to the abattoir, before deductions (eg procurement, transport, insurance, inspection, levy).
Prime sheep are reported as new season lambs (male and female clean sheep from this year’s crop) or old season lambs (male and female clean sheep from last year’s crop) sometimes referred to as hoggs or hoggets. This price series shows old season lambs from 1st January to the third Monday in May and new season lambs thereafter.
The Standard Quality Quotation is a UK industry standard weight band for the carcase of dressed prime sheep weighing between 12kg and 21.5kg.
Please note that there was a change in sample size from week ending 1st September 2018.
