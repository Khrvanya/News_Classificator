As he stood on stage, the Joker star – who has been vegan for most of his life – made a plea for humans to stop fighting each other and to stop using the world’s only natural resources.
The actor ranted: ‘We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and when she gives birth, we steal her baby. Even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable.
‘And then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal.
‘And I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something to give something up but human beings, at our best, are so inventive and creative and ingenious, and I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop, and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment.’

Joaquin’s speech on the cruelty involved in industrial dairy farming divided many at home, with some praising him for speaking out.
‘I am so very proud of Joaquin Phoenix and especially for what he said in his speech,’ one user tweeted.  ‘I have wanted to say those exact words for years, but could never articulate them the way he did tonight.  I hope and pray that all humans heard that message and act on it.’
However, some thought the Walk The Line actor’s speech was a little strange.
‘Sure, Parasite was the upset of the night. But five years from now, the only thing I am going to remember from this Oscars is Joaquin Phoenix standing on stage and saying the words “artificially inseminate a cow”,’ said another.
Ah, don’t you love it when you get to the 92nd Academy Awards and get to listen to five minutes of cow insemination talk?
