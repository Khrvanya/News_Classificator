A horrified wife has spoken out about her experience at University Hospital Limerick when her husband was brought in by ambulance.
Emily Kearns, who is in her 50s, was appalled by the conditions, describing the facility as “worse than a cattle market”.

Mrs Kearns said: “The conditions are horrendous, not only for patients but also staff.
