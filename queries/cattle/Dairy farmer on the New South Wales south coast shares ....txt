A dairy farmer on the south coast of New South Wales has shared shocking before and after pictures of his farm after it was razed by fire in just 10 minutes.
Robert Miller from the town of Milton, about an hour north of Bateman's Bay, raced to save his herd of 1,000 cattle as fire closed in on his farm on New Year's Day.
'It hit the farm at 1pm and was all over by 1.10pm, it came through very fast. It was ferocious, it was catastrophic.' Mr Miller told The Land .

'We had done all the preparation we could have, we had the equipment and water in place but we lost power, so we had to use generators to power everything.'
He led his cattle onto a concrete area where they stood under sprinklers for the duration of the fire passing through.
About half of Mr Millers 322 hectare farm was destroyed in the blaze.
The town of Milton is at the middle of the Currowan bushfire which has merged with two other smaller fires to stretch 100km from Bateman's Bay to Nowra on the NSW south coast.
