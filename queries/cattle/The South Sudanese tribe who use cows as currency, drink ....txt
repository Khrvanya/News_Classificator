A boy squirts milk into his mouth straight from a cow's udder and another lovingly caresses a bull's horn - meet the cattle-revering Mundari tribe of South Sudan.
Photographer Mario Gerth, 42, captured their daily lives in this spectacular set of images after spending three months living among them.
The nomadic tribe wander the plains of the Sahel region of the country along the Nile river and use cattle as currency.
Their lives are so intimately entwined with their cattle they even shower under the animals' urine because they believe it protects them against infections.
In one photograph, a boy can be seen blowing air up a cow's bottom to stimulate milk production.
But incredibly, they never eat their flesh and their diet consists mainly of milk and yoghurt.
Mario, from Germany, said: 'The Mundari do not see the difference between man and cow. They eat, sleep, and walk together.  The cows are everything to them - currency, food, and pride.'
