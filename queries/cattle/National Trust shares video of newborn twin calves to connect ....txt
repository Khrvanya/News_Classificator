Dinefwr is a National Trust site home to the historic Newton House and surrounded by a nature reserve and 18th century landscape.
Ranger Carol Bailey, who captured the calves' first steps, said: â€œIt really is a privilege to care for the White Park cattle at Dinefwr and to see the twin calves taking their first steps.

The first recorded evidence in Wales can be traced back to the Laws of Hywel Dda, King of the old Welsh Kingdom of Deheubarth who lived between 880 and 950.
Hywel Dda had all the old laws of Wales collated to produce the first codified work of laws to govern Wales as one nation.
The old laws revealed that White Park cattle were often used to pay fines and indicated a long-established tradition of this distinctive breed being used as currency.
