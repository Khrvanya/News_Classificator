The Bahamas flagged vessel named Bader III, which specializes in transporting live cattle, docked last weekend at Estaleiro Rio Grande Pier, Brazil, to handle the largest ever shipment of such cargo at the port.
The vessel`s infrastructure for such cargo is of the highest standard, even by international comparison. It has a 26,000-ton capacity, and is 204 meters long and 26.5 meters wide.
According to Sagres, the operator responsible for loading the vessel, before docking, the vessel went through a series of inspection protocols and compliance with pre-operational conditions. Within this protocol is strict compliance with the regulations determined by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, the Federal Revenue Service and the Rio Grande Port Authority.
It is worth remembering that no crew member is allowed onto Brazilian soil to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
The cattle shipped were sourced from various parts of the Rio Grande do Sul state . Most of the animals are of European breeds like Hereford and Angus, as well as crossbreeds such as Braford and Brangus, among others, which are highly appreciated in several consumer markets in the Middle East for their quality and flavor.
