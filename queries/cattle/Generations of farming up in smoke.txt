"Our farming enterprise has been totally decimated by this, the structure of the enterprise and workings of the enterprise that we've built up," Mr Jarvis said.
"Me personally over 40 years, but my father and grandfather before that and great-grandfather before that."
Of the 600 cattle on the farm, 62 died or were put down immediately after the fires.
Mr Jarvis has decided to keep just 40 of the surviving herd.

"It's very sad to lose the generationality (sic) of the animals that have been running around this farm, but unfortunately, we've got to be hard-hearted because we can't feed them," he said.
"The cost both financially and physically and mentally of trying to look after that many animals through that amount of time, I thought was beyond me and our family to do that."
It could take months for burnt-out paddocks to regrow, even with a decent amount of rain.
Farmers like Mr Jarvis believe it will take five to 10 years to get back to where they were before the disaster.
"It takes a lot to get through that and to sort of try to figure out what to do first, and what to do straight after that, and after and after and after," he said.
In the Nariel Valley, the Klippel family had two properties and nearly all of their 600 hectares of farmland destroyed, with 20 kilometres separating the two farms.

"These fires weren't just little fires, these were fire storms," Sarah Klippel said.
"We've had bushfires around before, we've had fires flanking us on both sides on the mountains, no impact at all.
"I don't think we would have ever expected to be devastated in such that, you know, to have whole livelihoods in two places demolished at one time."
