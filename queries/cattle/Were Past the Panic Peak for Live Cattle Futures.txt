August Feeder Cattle futures ripped higher at the end of last week but finished the session near unchanged after failing against our 3-star resistance pocket, 130.30-131.225. If the bulls can achieve consecutive closes above this pocket, we believe that would open the door for a retest of the March 25 highs, 139.00. On the support side of things, 123.475-124.30 is the first pocket the bulls need to defend. A close below here could lead to a bigger pullback. We believe the bull camp has a slight advantage on the chart, so we would be looking to buy a pullback to first support.
June Lean Hogs have been on fire since bottoming out in the middle of April, rallying over $20! Our significant resistance pocket comes in from 63.25-64.25. This pocket represents the gap from March 27and the 50-day moving average. We continue to believe we will see the market start to develop a range in the coming week or two. We would be waiting for that to happen before getting aggressive in trading this mustang.
