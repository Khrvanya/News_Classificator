These figures provide a summary of average sales prices for commercial dairy cattle at GB auction markets. Prices and sales numbers are reported for calves, heifers and cows by breed.
Figures are based on statistical months to account for five-week months. Any month-on-month comparisons for numbers sold should be treated with caution.
Figures are changed retrospectively as reports from dispersal sales come in.
Figures from January 2017 no longer include pedigree prices. Pedigree sales prices can be accessed from the Holstein UK sales reports (see below).
