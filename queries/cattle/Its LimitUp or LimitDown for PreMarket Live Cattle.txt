Feeder Cattle futures remain range-bound but feel poised for a bigger directional move — we are leaning on that being higher —  as that range continues to tighten up. Resistance comes in from 130.30-131.225. These are wider ranges than we typically like to rely on, but that’s the environment we are in. If the bulls can achieve consecutive closes above this pocket, we believe that would open the door for a retest of the March 25 highs, 139.00. On the support side of things, 123.475-124.30 is the first pocket the Bulls need to defend. A close below here could lead to a bigger pullback. We believe the bull camp has a slight advantage on the chart, but they need to see a move above resistance soon. A failure will show a lack of conviction and the bears could pounce.
Good exports and strong technical momentum helped lean hogs regain some of the lost ground from the previous session, taking us to the highest close since March 31. First resistance comes in at 60.775, the next and more significant resistance pocket comes in from 63.25-64.25. This pocket represents the gap from March 27 and the 50-day moving average. We continue to believe we'll see the market start to develop a range in the coming week or two. Wait for that to happen before getting aggressive in trading this mustang.
