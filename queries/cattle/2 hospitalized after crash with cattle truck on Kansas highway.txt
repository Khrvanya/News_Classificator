BARTON COUNTY  —Two people were injured in an accident just after noon Wednesday in Barton County.
Investigation at the scene indicates a 2020 Ford F250 pickup truck operated by Kayden M Calloway age 24, Hoisington, was northbound on NE. 50th Avenue, according to Sheriff Brian Bellendir.
Calloway failed to yield right-of-way while attempting to make a turn onto Kansas 96.  A westbound 2010 Peterbilt truck tractor operated by Francis E Mastel age 71, Rantoul, Kansas, struck the F250.
A third vehicle, a 2017 Ford F 150 operated by Craig Fischer, 66 of Ellinwood was eastbound and went into the south ditch in an attempt to avoid the collision of the other two vehicles.
The F250 struck Fischer's vehicle  when it overturned and rolled into the ditch, according to Bellendir.
Mastel and Calloway were transported to the hospital in Great Bend with non-life-threatening injuries. Fischer was treated at the scene and released.
The semi-trailer was loaded with 58 head of cattle and overturned during the collision. Men and equipment were brought to the scene to assist in removing the cattle from the truck. K96 was closed for approximately 2 ½ hours, according to Bellendir.
The Sheriff’s Office was assisted at the scene by the Great Bend Fire Department and EMS service and Kansas Department of Transportation.
