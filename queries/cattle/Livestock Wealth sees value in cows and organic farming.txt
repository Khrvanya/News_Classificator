An age-old practice of keeping livestock as a source of wealth still exists in modern times. Livestock Wealth extended an invitation to those interested in learning more about investing in livestock at a launch held in Houghton.
CEO of Livestock Wealth, Ntuthuko Shezi said he grew up in a rural area where cows were the ‘bedrock’ of his family’s finances and that aroused his interest in doing things that have never been done.
“Livestock Wealth is a crowd-farming platform that enables one to be a farmer,” Shezi explained.

“We launched in 2015 with 26 cows and today we have 2 000 cattle. In 2018 we started supplying retails giants with free-range beef.”
He added that their initiative offers investors the opportunity to invest in a sustainable farm through buying their own cow, watching it grow and reaping rewards from careful management by experienced cattle farmers.
“Our main job is to connect investors to farmers as investors want to own real, high-value growing assets but may lack time or skills to be a farmer whereas the farmer needs an investor because he owns high-value growing assets with time and skills to farm but may lack capital; therefore both need each other.”
