There’s no magic formula to the Peterson & Shaner success, but there is a formula. It begins with the Hoffman family.
President Chad Hoffman is a boots-in-the field leader, chief strategizer and head truck driver.
His mother, Linda Hoffman, is majority owner of the business, does the books and pays the bills.
Brian, Chad’s brother, is key to keeping the computers computing and the machinery running.
Tyler is Chad’s oldest son and a big help at whatever needs to be done around the farm.
Husband and father Rick Hoffman is an accountant who works off the farm and is available for financial planning and decisions.
Carl Gill has been the farm’s butcher for the past 15 years and came into the business after a 25-year career as the meat manager for a large supermarket chain in southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.
Abby Wynings wraps the meat, helps keep the butcher shop organized and, like everyone else in the tightly knit enterprise, goes above and beyond when the need arises.
Chad Hoffman said Gill and Wynings are more like family than employees.
He also expressed his profound appreciation for the Peterson family, which owns the farmland on which the Hoffmans graze their cattle and grow their hay.
In the 1950s, Edward C. Peterson bought five different farms in the Douglassvile area. About 1960, he hired Robert E. Shaner — Linda Hoffman’s father, Chad and Brian’s grandfather — to help manage the farms. In 1965, Peterson and Shaner incorporated the business that still bears their names.
The Petersons have never farmed the land, but the family is determined to keep their properties in agriculture.
“I can’t say enough about the Peterson family, and about how much I and my family appreciate the fact that they’ve made it possible for us to farm this land for three generations — 60 years — and to do the kind of work we love to do,” Hoffman said.
