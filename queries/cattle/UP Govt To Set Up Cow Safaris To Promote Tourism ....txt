For upkeep and better safety of cattle, and to deal with stray cattle menace, the Uttar Pradesh government has planned to set up “cow safaris”.
UP Animal and Husbandry minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary came up with the innovative idea in line with the Yogi government’s aim to protect cows.
“Having so many cows at one place and with better upkeep facilities, we are also thinking of developing it for tourism. Like people go to see safaris of other animals we can make arrangements for tourists to come and see cow safaris,” he said.
This is one of the several steps taken by the Yogi government towards cow protection.
“The Yogi government is vigilant towards cow protection and it is our duty to save and secure them,” NDTV quoted Chaudhary as saying.
“Wherever we have large farms like in Barabanki and Maharajganj, we on an experimental basis, want to set up a safari where 15,000 to 25,000 cows can be put up,” he added.
He expressed his desire to make such safaris viable by setting up units to make objects from cow waste and biogas plants for power generation.
“There are complaints about stray cattle moving about in villages and I have brought it to the notice of the chief minister,” he said.
Initially, cow safaris will launch on a pilot basis.
