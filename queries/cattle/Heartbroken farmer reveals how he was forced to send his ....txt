The farmer added that the cows' deaths represented an 'epic failure of government', adding that aid for his cattle still hadn't arrived.
'[It's] too late now and frankly I'm yet to see how we are helped on the ground,' he added.
He said he could not afford hay and that water restrictions meant that he could not produce food for his cows either.
The man said the cows would have starved to death as he couldn't source or afford food for them, and assistance from the Government hadn't arrived (stock)
Earlier this year the Morrison Government announced changes to a financial assistance program designed to help farmers who are struggling.
In October it was announced that couplesÂ who are reaching the end of the four-year limit on Farm Household Allowance, will get $13,000.
Singles who are coming off the Farm Household Allowance will get $7,500.
Farmers will also be allowed to earn $100,000 a year outside of farming.
The bill will allow farmers to receive the FHA payment four years in every decade.
