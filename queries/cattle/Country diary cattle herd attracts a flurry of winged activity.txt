A herd of brown cattle walk slowly across the softly undulating field on the summit, stopping to munch on the green, rippling grass. At their feet is a flock of chattering starlings, wearing brown-grey feathers – this year’s fledglings have paler heads – while they moult into their winter plumage. The starlings strut, jump and run between the feet of the cows, feeding on the insects, worms and grubs being churned up with the ground. When the cattle surge forward, the birds splutter into the air, and fly in a tight diamond around the field before settling down. They edge back towards the animals’ feet and feed again.
Then I hear high-pitched, repeated “seep, see-eep” calls – three slender birds with long tails take off from the ground, bounce in the air four times, before landing. I watch the grass with my binoculars, looking through the legs of the cattle. I finally find the little birds bobbing up and down in the grass – yellow wagtails . They have greyish heads and backs, with pale eye-stripes and slender, pointed bills. Only as they move around and fly up do I see the pale yellowish underparts. They are an adult and two young birds, again feeding before they fly south.
