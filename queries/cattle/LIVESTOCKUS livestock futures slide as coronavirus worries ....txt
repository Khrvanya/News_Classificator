CHICAGO, April 9 (Reuters) - U.S. livestock futures slumped again on Thursday, volatility roiling the market as it faced resistance over surging stocks and growing concerns that meat packers will close plants in the coronavirus pandemic.
Lean hog future prices slipped for a second session on concerns about the domestic glut of hog supplies and mounting worries about processors being shuttered - even temporarily.
That, in turn, is increasing concerns about packers ability to process livestock and poultry in a timely manner.
Smithfield Foods Inc, the world’s biggest pork processor, said on Thursday it is temporarily closing a plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, because of the new coronavirus, the latest disruption to the U.S. food supply chain from the outbreak.
“The market keeps trying to carve out a bottom, and we don’t seem to be there yet,” said Ted Seifried, chief market strategist for Zaner Ag Hedge.
Cattle future prices also slid on Thursday, as traders said that meat processing is starting to slow, causing back-ups in the meat supply chain which has already been struggling with stockpiles due to the shuttering of the global food service sector - a significant buyer of meat.
That, in turn, is causing livestock producers economic woe, as cow-calf operators and feedlot owners are still bearing the cost of feeding their animals.
