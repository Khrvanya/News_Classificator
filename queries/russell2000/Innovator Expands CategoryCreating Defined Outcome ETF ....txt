CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2020 / Innovator Capital Management, LLC (Innovator) announced today the April series Innovator Nasdaq-100 Power Buffer ETF™ ( NAPR ) and Innovator Russell 2000 Power Buffer ETF™ ( KAPR ) are scheduled to begin trading, expanding its category-creating Defined Outcome ETF™ suite to forty-three Buffer ETFs in total.
Additionally, the April series of Innovator S&P 500 Buffer ETFs successfully completed their initial outcome period and was reset yesterday, based on the current level of the S&P 500 Price Return Index, receiving new upside caps and downside buffers for the next one-year outcome period ahead, which concludes on March 31, 2021.
"Our April Buffer ETF™ series features some the highest upside cap rates we have seen since our Defined Outcome ETF suite launched in 2018," said Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator ETFs. "Defined Outcome ETFs are particularly well suited for the current market environment - allowing advisors to increase equity exposure with a greater degree of confidence after this big market pullback, knowing they have specific downside buffer levels against loss.
"With the significant upside caps now available, the April series of Innovator S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Russell 2000 Buffer ETFs can be an ideal solution for advisors positioning client portfolios for a potential market rebound."

Unlike structured notes, which offer limited liquidity, Innovator Defined Outcome ETFs trade throughout the day on an exchange, like a stock. As a result, investors purchasing shares of a Fund after its launch date may achieve a different payoff profile than those who entered the Fund on day one. Innovator recognizes this as a benefit of the Funds and provides a web-based tool that allows investors to know, in real-time throughout the trading day, their potential defined outcome return profile before they invest, based on the current ETF price and the Outcome Period remaining. Innovator's web tool can be accessed at http://www.innovatoretfs.com/define .
Each Innovator Defined Outcome ETF seeks to provide a defined exposure to a broad market index (such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, and MSCI EM) where the downside buffer level, upside growth potential to a Cap, and Outcome Period are all known, prior to investing. Innovator recently began expanding its suite of S&P 500 Buffer ETFs into a monthly series to provide investors more opportunities to purchase shares as close to the beginning of their respective Outcome Periods as possible.
Investors can purchase shares of a previously listed Defined Outcome ETF throughout the entire Outcome Period, obtaining a current set of defined outcome parameters, which are disclosed daily through a web tool available at: http://innovatoretfs.com/define/ .
Innovator is focused on delivering defined outcome based solutions inside the benefit-rich ETF wrapper, retaining many of the features that have contributed to the success of structured products3 (e.g., downside buffer levels, upside participation, defined outcome parameters), but with the added benefits of transparency, liquidity and lower costs afforded by the ETF structure.
Each Fund will hold a portfolio of custom exchange-traded FLEX Options that have varying strike prices (the price at which the option purchaser may buy or sell the security, at the expiration date), and the same expiration date (approximately one year). The layering of these FLEX Options with varying strike prices provides the mechanism for producing a Fund's desired outcome (i.e. Cap or buffer). Each Fund intends to roll options components annually, on the last business day of the month associated with each Fund.
The ETFs are subadvised by Milliman Financial Risk Management LLC (Milliman FRM), a global leader in financial risk management and one of the largest ETF sub advisors. Milliman FRM was also instrumental in the design of the Cboe S&P 500 Target Outcome Indexes, which the Innovator Defined Outcome S&P 500 Buffer ETFs are benchmarked against.
Although each Fund seeks to achieve the defined outcomes stated in its investment objective, there is no guarantee that it will do so. The returns that the Funds seek to provide do not include the costs associated with purchasing shares of the Fund and certain expenses incurred by the Fund.
