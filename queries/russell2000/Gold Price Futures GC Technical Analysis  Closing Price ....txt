Gold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis – Closing Price Reversal Top, First Sign of Weak Buying
A trade through $1747.10 will confirm the closing price reversal top. If this creates enough downside momentum then look over the next 2 to 3 days into $1682.40 to $1657.30. Since the main trend is up, buyers are likely to come in on a test of this area.
Gold futures hit a 7-year high early in the session on Tuesday, but then the profit-takers and short-sellers took over, sending the market lower for the session. The pattern formed was a potentially bearish closing price reversal top. This doesn’t mean the trend is getting ready to change to down, but if confirmed, we could see the start of a 2 to 3 day sell-off.
Another interpretation of the chart pattern suggests that due to the prolonged move up in terms of price and time ($212.80 in 8 days), the selling may be greater than the buying at current price levels. Others may also interpret the pattern to mean that the buying dried up and the sellers stepped in.
