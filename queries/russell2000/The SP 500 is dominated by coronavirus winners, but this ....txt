The S&P 500 is dominated by coronavirus ‘winners,’ but this could mean the index is destined to lag these benchmarks, analyst says
Even as U.S. stocks have pulled back in recent days, many investors and analysts remained puzzled by just how vigorously the major indexes have rebounded since late March, even as the coronavirus epidemic has ground the U.S. economy to a halt.
But a close look at the composition of the S&P 500 index SPX,
illustrates why the stock market has been remarkably resilient in the face of accumulating evidence of widespread economic dislocation, according to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research.

In such an environment, the equal-weighted S&P 500 SP500EW,
