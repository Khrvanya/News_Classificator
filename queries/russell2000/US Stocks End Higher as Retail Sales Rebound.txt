U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday on fresh data showing consumer spending rebounded in May, the latest sign that the worst of the economic shock from the pandemic may have passed.
Retail sales rose 17.7% in May, according to data from the Commerce Department, marking a sharp bounceback from a record slump in March and April during the depths of the pandemic. Mayâ€™s jump was the biggest monthly increase in retail spending in records dating back to 1992.
