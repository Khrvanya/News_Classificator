Gold futures climbed Thursday for a second consecutive session. "Unemployment numbers continue piling up, we're almost 100% guaranteed a recession in the near-term, and given how unprecedented this all is, I think many investors have lost confidence in the ability for anything outside of borderline risk-free assets to 'save them' from a potential next-leg-down in stocks," said Adam Koos, president of Libertas Wealth Management Group. June gold gcm20 rose $7.10, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,745.40 an ounce. That was the highest most-active contract finish since April 14, according to FactSet data.
