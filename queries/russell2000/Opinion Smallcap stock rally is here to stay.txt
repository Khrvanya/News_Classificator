Let’s break down those questions.
For question No. 1: Yes for the long term. Still, a lower entry price is possible in the short term.
Based on my composite of indicators, there is little reason to doubt the long-term validity of the signal.
The daily chart of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM,
, below, shows why a short-term pullback is possible:
Price has not yet broken out and is at double resistance.
RSI-2, a measure of short-term momentum, is over-bought (short-term risk is elevated).
RSI-35, a measure of longer-term momentum, has not yet broken out.
A retest of the 150-151 zone would be normal. A close below 150 would postpone the rally and allow for a deeper pullback.
For question No. 2: It’s often said that small-caps are more economically sensitive and therefore a leading indicator. In theory this sounds good, but in reality that’s not really the case.
Readers may remember my mid-term bearish projection published here , and the Russell 2000 breadth thrust certainly does not support this forecast.
In fact, starting in mid-August, I noticed a number of bullish “under the hood” developments likely to cause a bounce and warned that: “We’ve seen bounces catch fire before, and aggressive investors afraid of missing out may grab some long exposure.”
The Russell 2000 sure caught fire, and history suggests it will continue to burn higher over the next year. The over-bought condition and bearish September/October seasonality should, however, provide a lower buy point.
