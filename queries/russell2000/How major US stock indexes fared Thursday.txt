Stocks capped a choppy day of trading on Wall Street with gains Thursday as turnaround by banks and energy companies helped end a two-day losing streak.
The S&P 500 managed a gain of 1.2%, but it’s still on pace to finish lower for the week. Technology and financial stocks accounted for a big slice of the gains. Energy stocks did well after the price of crude oil bounced up 9% on hopes that demand could pick up after collapsing amid the coronavirus shutdowns.
