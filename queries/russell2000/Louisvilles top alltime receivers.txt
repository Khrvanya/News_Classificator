Louisville has been home to a number of elite wide receivers through the years and that trend continues through today. A program that has produced greats such as Deion Branch, Mark Clayton, Harry Douglas, DeVante Parker, and a host of others, is currently home to a pair that have already placed their names in the record books.
Senior Dez Fitzpatrick and junior Tutu Atwell give the Cardinals two of the more experienced receivers in the country. In the first year of the Scott Satterfield era, the pair were the team's top leading receivers, combining for 1,907 yards and 18 touchdowns. Atwell topped the ACC in receiving yards (1,276) and touchdown receptions (12), while establishing a new school mark for yards and equal the record for touchdown catches.
Atwell and Fitzpatrick are already present or nearing top 10 lists for multiple school career receiving records, which would push them into a group that includes a Super Bowl MVP in Branch and a number of others that went on to enjoy professional careers.
Here's a look at the top wide receivers in program history:
The program's career reception list is topped by the first receiver to reach 300 career catches in the history of the NCAA. Arnold Jackson set the mark that no one in UofL history has even flirted with nearing.
9. Jamie Asher : 153 : 1991-9410.
** With 106 career receptions, senior Dez Fitzpatrick needs 46 this season to reach the top 10.
** Junior Tutu Atwell has 94 career catches and needs 58 to crack the top 10 list.
Tutu Atwel's 70 catches in 2019 ranks as the program's eighth best single-season total. Arnold Jackson, the only UofL receiver to record more than 80 receptions in a season, holds the top two spots.
