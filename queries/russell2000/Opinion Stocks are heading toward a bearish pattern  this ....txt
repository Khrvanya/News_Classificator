, allow for a pullback.
The odds of a broader stock market pullback increase if: 1. Apple fails to move above resistance around 360; and: 2. Amazon falls below support around 2,620.
On June 10, the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the CBOE Equity Put/Call Ratio fell below 0.50. This means that option traders bought more calls (bullish strategy) than puts (bearish strategy) for 20 days. This rarely happens.
If we relax the parameters, we find seven other periods when the ratio dropped below 0.51. The various graphs below show the forward performance for the S&P 500 (starting when the ratio dropped below 0.51 for the first time).
This is just one of over 300 studies I analyzed over the past six months. Many of the more recent studies suggest short-term weakness. (Additional studies along with the Risk/Reward Heat Map are available here .)
In summary: As long as the S&P 500 stays below 3,235 and 3,180, the bearish “1, 2” pattern should not be ignored.
The Nasdaq Composite just broke through record levels. Tesla hammered out a new high. So did Netflix. And Amazon reached $3,000 for the first time. Happy days, indeed, in the stock market. But will it last?
