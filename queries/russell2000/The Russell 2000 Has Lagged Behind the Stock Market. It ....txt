The Russell 2000 index hasn’t performed as well as the broader market.
In the past five years, expecting the Russell 2000 index to outperform the broad market has been like rooting for a sports team with a continuous losing record. Are the Russell’s fortunes about to improve?
Searching for patterns when the Russell has outperformed the stock market, we found that it has fairly closely tracked the performance of the Dow Jones Transportation Average .
      When the Dow Transports outperforms the market, so does the Russell 2000. And when the transports index underperforms the market, the Russell 2000 lags behind also.
What are they doing now? For the past four years, both have lagged behind the broad market by a wide margin. However both have retreated to strong long-term support levels versus the S&P 500 index. And momentum for both the Transports and the Russell indexes has reached oversold levels.
Price-wise, the Russell hurdled “1-2-3” resistance. After three thrusts into resistance followed by pullbacks, the Russell hurdled the 1600 barrier two weeks ago. That generated upside projections to the 1700 area in my work.
But more importantly, is the Russell preparing finally to outperform the S&P 500? From the chart below, notice that relative strength returned to 30-year trendline support. And momentum is the most oversold since the 1999 secular bear market low. If relative strength can stabilize here, then the Russell could be preparing to reward investors in 2020.
