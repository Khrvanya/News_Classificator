CME said that successful options contracts require a robust, liquid underlying futures market. Since launching one year ago, Micro E-mini Equity futures have rapidly developed round-the-clock liquidity and become the most successful new product in CME Group’s history.
243 million cumulative contracts traded across all four indices – S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average – including 120 million Micro E-mini S&P 500 and 87 million Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures contracts,
913,000 contracts traded across all four products on average each day,
27% of trading volume originated outside of the U.S., and
155,000+ unique accounts have traded these contracts.
Options on the Micro E-mini S&P 500 and Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures will be 1/10th the size of their E-mini options counterparts, according to CME. The listing cycle for the new options will consist of five Friday weekly options, three end-of-month options, and two quarterly options contracts.
Micro E-mini Equity options will be listed by and subject to the rules of CME.
