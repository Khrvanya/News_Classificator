The world’s faltering effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak led to a rout in stocks and crude oil on Monday, as new cases surfacing across the globe amplified fears of a downturn. Each of the three major indices dropped more than 7% by market close, with the Dow shedding more than 2,000 points.
The decline marked the largest one-day point loss for the Dow on record, and the largest single-session percentage hit since 2008. The S&P 500’s more than 7% drop was also the most since December 2008, led by stunning declines in the Energy and Financial sectors.
Worldwide cases of COVID-19 have topped 109,000 — with Italy emerging as the worst-hit country outside of China and the biggest in Europe, as new infections rise in the U.S. The Italian government’s move to quarantine its entire northern region raised new fears about the pathogen becoming a global pandemic, sending markets into a free-fall.
A grim offshore trading session turned into a full-fledged rout as equities sold off — which even a brief “circuit-breaker” trading halt couldn’t staunch. In the bond market, the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury interest rate fell to a new all-time low, with the entire yield curve falling below 1% during Monday’s session.
Brent crude ( BZ=F ) prices collapsed, falling by more than 30% on Sunday evening in what was the largest single-day drop since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 1991. Prices for Brent and West Texas intermediate crude oil each settled lower by more than 20% Monday.
OPEC’s failure last week to strike a deal to cut production prompted Saudi Arabia to lean in aggressively on cheaper oil prices, which fanned concerns about a full-fledged price war that sent oil into free-fall . Investors appeared to price in the likelihood that Saudi Arabia’s fight with Russia over market share will worsen the dramatic spiral lower in prices, taking place against a backdrop of falling demand and plentiful supply.
The coronavirus epidemic has stoked fears of a sharp global downturn, which have in turn weighed heavily on major benchmarks and crude ( CL=F ).
Most economists estimate that cheaper oil translates into lower gasoline prices, which act as a de-facto tax cut for consumers.
Yet with the COVID-19 epidemic creating supply shocks and forcing business activity to grind to a halt, analysts don’t see much to cheer about in the current price action.
“There's always winners and losers in any market, but right now the idea that lower gasoline prices is going to put more cash in workers' pockets and give consumer spending and the economy a boost doesn't seem to cushion the blow for stock market investors,” wrote Chris Rupkey, MUFG’s chief financial economist, in an email on Sunday evening.
“They want out. Big time. The sky is falling,” he said.

Other analysts agreed that lower oil prices ultimately represent a downside risk to the domestic economy.
“Lower oil prices used to be an unambiguous positive for the U.S. economy as a significant net oil importer with energy consumption dominating over any domestic production,” Morgan Stanley economist Robert Rosener said in a note Monday. “But with gains in the domestic energy industry over this cycle, that relationship has grown to be increasingly balanced.”
While declining oil prices might add billions in disposable income to consumers’ wallets, the simultaneous concerns stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak will ultimately leave consumers hesitant to spend, Rosener said.
“A more cautious consumer in the current environment is likely to pare down the upside effect from lower oil prices in the near-term,” he added.
Analysts are also nervously eyeing U.S. shale producers, which are expected to suffer as cheap oil makes it unprofitable to churn out more supply. Most have financed expansion via debt, fueled by cheap credit.
“U.S. shale production is capital intensive, and debt servicing made for high fixed costs,” noted Marc Chandler, managing director at Bannockburn Global Forex. “Even before the latest shocks, shale producers were struggling.”
The three major indices each tumbled more than 7% by the end of Monday’s session, with the Dow off more than 2,000 points.
In the S&P 500, the energy sector remained the laggard, shedding 20% during Monday’s session.

A rising number of U.S. colleges canceled in-class instruction as the coronavirus outbreak escalates.
On Monday, Fordham University said it would be suspending face-to-face instruction at all of the college’s New York-area campuses, effective as of Monday afternoon. Meanwhile, Princeton University said it would be requiring all lectures and seminars be held virtually beginning March 23, after the school’s spring break.
Columbia University, which had one individual in the community quarantined due to exposure to the virus, said Sunday it would not hold classes Monday or Tuesday and would shift to virtual courses for the rest of the week. In New York, Hofstra University on Long Island and Yeshiva University in Manhattan each announced that classes would be canceled the rest of this week.
Stanford University in California nixed in-person courses for the last two weeks of its winter quarter, after one faculty member tested positive for COVID-19. In Texas, Rice University on Sunday canceled all in-person classes this week.
1:53 p.m. ET: White House to invite Wall Street leaders to discuss coronavirus concerns, CNBC reports

The state of Florida issued an announcement Monday encouraging all individuals who traveled internationally to self-quarantine for 14 days following their return to the U.S., regardless of where they traveled.

European shares slid Monday, with Europe’s benchmark STOXX 600 and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 each sinking into bear market territory.
The FTSE 100 fell 7.3% during the session to 5,994.04, sending it 22% below its recent closing high from July 2019. The Stoxx 600 fell 7.4% in its largest one-day decline since October 2008, also entering a bear market at 21.5% below its recent closing high on February 19 this year.
Bear markets are considered a 20% decline from a recent closing high.
The U.S. Justice Department said Monday that companies or individuals participating in price-fixing or bid-rigging for personal health protection products like face masks and sterile gloves could face prosecution. These items have become highly in demand amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
“The Department of Justice stands ready to make sure that bad actors do not take advantage of emergency response efforts, healthcare providers, or the American people during this crucial time,” Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement.
The announcement comes as individual companies have taken actions to try and stem price gouging on their platforms and beyond. Facebook banned ads for medical face masks, along with ads that implied limited supply for medical products, to help quell elevated consumer concerns surrounding the outbreak. Amazon last week removed hundreds of thousands of high-priced offers for personal medical items on its site.
Energy names are tanking amid a broader decline in crude oil prices. The Energy sector lagged in the S&P 500, dropping more than 17%.
