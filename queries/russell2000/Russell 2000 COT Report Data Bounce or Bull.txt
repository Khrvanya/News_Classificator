With stocks trading higher, volatility has tapered off again, giving life to higher beta stocks like tech and small caps. Will the small caps make a run higher this week? Let’s look at the COT data and technicals to see what’s next.
Leave this field empty if you're human:
The rally in 2019 has seen the Russell 2000 make new highs in late February 2019 before correcting and making lower highs since. This past Monday, the Russell 2000 made lower lows. Not what bulls want to see.
However, bulls did step up and buy that low creating a declining channel.  Upside resistance sits at 1550, which may be the path of least resistance near term. Should the Russell 2000 breakout above that level, then we may see a test of the 200-day moving average (then 1600, if bulls are really strong).
Flows were stronger this week. For the week ending Wednesday, the iShares core S&P small-cap ETF (IJR) attracted $20 million and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) $358 million – data courtesy of ETF.com.
