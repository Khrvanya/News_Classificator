2:21 p.m. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is having a good day , so good in fact that it’s close to a record high . Small-cap stocks, however, have gained more than four times as much on Monday
The Dow has risen 136.28 points, or 0.5%, to 28,011.90, and sits just a touch below its record high of 28,036.22. The small-company Russell 2000 ,
      however, has gained 2.1% to 1,621.47, and looks like it’s finally ready to catch up to its large-cap brethren.
Even better, the Russell 2000 look set to finally break through the resistance that has keep it lagging for much of the year:
“Small Caps broke out above stubborn 1,615 (160) resistance from a year-long base of support setting the stage for another 10% short term upside as Biotech (XBI) and Banks (KRE) drive the action and Breadth expands,” writes Evercore ISI’s Rich Ross.
The Russell 2000 has gained 20% in 2019, in line with the Dow’s 20% rise, but lagging the S&P 500 ’s
      30% climb. Yet while the other indexes are touching all-time highs, the Russell 2000 is still 7.4% away from its own.
Time to win the race?
