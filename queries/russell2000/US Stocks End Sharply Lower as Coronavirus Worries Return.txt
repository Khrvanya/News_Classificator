Dow falls more than 1,800 points; concerns about a new wave of infections send investors out of risky assets
Growing fears of a surge in coronavirus infections sent the stock market tumbling Thursday, pulling the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 1,800 points for its worst day since March.
For months, investors have been betting the U.S. and other countries will be able to reopen their economies without seeing a spike in coronavirus cases that might force them to backtrack. Stocks have risen accordingly, with the S&P 500 turning positive for the year as recently as Monday.
