Some investors assume the Nasdaq 100 is just a tech-laden index. And some of that widely-held opinion is understandable.
QQQ stock holds the 100 most valuable non-financial stocks that trade on the Nasdaq. Many technology companies play an important role in the ETF.
For instance the top Nasdaq 100 stock this year, up 137%, is video-calling firm Zoom. And the most important stock in the Nasdaq 100 is also a tech: Microsoft ( MSFT ). Microsoft, valued at $1.4 trillion, holds a larger weight in the Nasdaq 100 than any other, nearly 12%.
Technology stocks account for 47% of the Nasdaq 100. That's higher than the tech sector's 27% weight in the S&P 500 and 26% weight in the Dow. But that means more than half of the QQQ ETF's value comes from sectors outside of technology , Rosenbluth says.
The communications services sector accounts for 20.4% of the Nasdaq 100, followed by 15% in consumer discretionary and 6% in consumer staples.
In fact, just three of the Nasdaq 100's best 10 stocks this year are techs: Zoom, Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Citrix Systems ( CTXS ). Tesla, which is up 94% this year and the Nasdaq 100's second-best stock, is in the consumer discretionary sector. The Nasdaq 100's third-best stock this year, up 91%, is insulin-device innovator with top-notch management DexCom ( DXCM ). It's in the health care sector and was recently added to the S&P 500.
But then there's health care member Seattle Genetics, up 42% this year, making it the fifth best Nasdaq 100 stock this year. It's not in the S&P 500 yet.
The QQQ continues to be an easy way to expose a portfolio to new ideas and innovation as it's less restrictive than some other indexes.
Tesla, for instance, at $150 billion is valuable enough to be the 64th largest stock in the S&P 500, says Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. But Tesla isn't likely to meet the S&P 500's requirement for a four-quarter profit run anytime soon, Colas says.
Innovative new companies are critical to returns. Microsoft, Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) all "had similar market caps in 2010 as Tesla has just now, and collectively they make up 23% of all the gains in the S&P 500 over the last decade," Colas says. "Their performance is what made the S&P 500 compound over the last decade at 13.4% instead of 10.4%."
But not everyone thinks QQQ is the new ETF benchmark.
The fact QQQ just so happens to omit financials , which are lagging, is a source of "accidental success," says Dave Nadig, chief investment officer at ETF Flows. "It's entirely the cult of what's working now," he said. "Nasdaq's largest non-financial listings just happen to be a good proxy right now for innovation and survivability."
And right now, that's exactly what most investors are looking for.
