June 12 (Renewables Now) - UK-based renewable fuels company Velocys Plc (LON:VLS) today said it has won a GBP-0.5-million (USD 0.63m/EUR 0.56m) grant from the Department of Transport for its planned waste-to-jet fuel plant.
Altalto Immingham will be the first commercial waste-to-jet fuel facility in the UK, according to Velocys. The plant will convert hundreds of thousands of tonnes of non-recyclable household and commercial waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually. The North East Lincolnshire Council's (NELC) planning committee last month granted planning permission to the project.
The company won another GBP 0.4 million in funding under the Future Fuels for Flight and Freight Competition's stage one back in 2018. Velocys is now one of the two remaining firms expected to secure the balance of funding in Stage Two, when future project milestones are reached.
Velocys is partnering on the project with UK airline British Airways Plc, part of International Airlines Group (LON:IAG), and Shell International Petroleum Company Ltd, which is part of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (LON:RDSA).
The fuel, produced using Velocys's technology, avoids about 70% of net greenhouse gas emissions for each tonne of conventional jet fuel it displaces.
The company said previously that construction of the plant could start in 2022, with fuel production commencing in 2025.
