The British Pound has rallied more than 10% against the US Dollar off the March lows with the rally taking Cable towards longer-term downtrend resistance. While the medium-term outlook remains constructive, the immediate advance may be vulnerable here as price approaches key technical resistance. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the GBP/ USD price charts. Review my latest Weekly Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Cable trade setup and more.

Technical Outlook: In my latest Sterling Price Outlook we noted that British Pound reversal was testing initial resistance hurdles into the close of the week with a topside breach exposing, “subsequent resistance objectives at the 2018 low-week close at 1.2582 and a key technical confluence at 1.2717/54- a region defined by the 61.8% retracement and the 2019 yearly open.”
Cable broke above the 61.8% retracement of the March range at 1.2518 with the rally taking out targets into 1.2582. The focus now is on a close with respect to the sliding parallel (magenta)- a close below would risk a near-term pullback in price. Broader bullish invalidation now raised to 1.2195 with a breach higher from here eyeing the 75% parallel (currently ~1.2670s) backed by critical resistance steady at 1.2717/54.
Notes: A closer look at Sterling price action shows GBP/USD trading within the confines of the ascending pitchfork formation with cable attempting to breach the 75% parallel today in New York. Topside resistance objectives are eyed at the highlighted slope confluence near ~1.2670s backed by 1.2710 and 1.2753- look for a more significant reaction there IF reached. Initial support rests at 1.2515 backed by the weekly open at 1.2461 and the post-Brexit low-week close at 1.2433- weakness beyond this zone would risk a larger correction with near-term bullish invalidation now set to 1.2328.
