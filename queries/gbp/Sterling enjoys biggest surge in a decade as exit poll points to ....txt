The pound hasÂ enjoyed its biggest surge in a decade as the City cheered predictions of a strong Conservative majority that wouldÂ finally end the Brexit deadlock.
Investors piled into sterling after the exit poll suggested Boris Johnson would be given a majority strong enough to put to bed the uncertainty plaguing businesses and the economy.
After sinking during nervy trading in the run-up to the exit poll, the pound erased early losses to soar more than 3pc against the dollar in just half an hour, breaking past the $1.35 milestone to its highest level in 19 months. It broke aboveÂ â‚¬1.20 against the euro, hitting its highest level since the aftermath of the EU referendum.
Top banks drafted in traders for a frantic night of dealing on currency markets with analysts predicting that sterling could build on its initial gains if the Tories secured their predicted majority.
Handover: exit polls to come very shortly!

With 90 minutes to go until #exitpoll , anyone else is glued to the live charts of the value of Sterling??
Reuters has just reported that Boeing Â has delayed plans to reach a record production rate of 57 737 jets per month next year,Â  according to industry sources, even before the US FAA announced a new delay in the 737 MAX return to service that raised uncertainty over production plans.
Sterling has recovered somewhat from its earlier plummet, although it is still slightly down against the dollar and the euro.
With everything about to kick off very soon (inÂ an hour and an half's time)Â I'm sure this we'll see plenty more movement to come.
