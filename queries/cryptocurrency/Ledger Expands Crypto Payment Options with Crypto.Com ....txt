Leading hardware wallet producer Ledger now lets the customers of its online shop with the Crypto.com crypto wallet application.
Leading hardware wallet producer, Ledger, now allows online customers to pay using Crypto.com’s wallet app.
According to an April 9 announcement , the firm has chosen to accept payment in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), XRP , Litecoin ( LTC ), and Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) via Crypto.com’s application. This is not the first time that Ledger has allowed its customers to pay with crypto. They already accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and XRP via their crypto payment processor, Bitpay.
Back in December 2018, the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding, which was mean to allow Ledger’s customers to purchase products with digital currency using Crypto.com’s service.
In a separate announcement , Ledger indicated that the first 20 users who make a purchase using this new payment method will receive a limited edition Crypto.com Ledger Nano S. Users who purchase Ledger hardware wallets from now until May 31 using Crypto.com will also have access to 10% cashback. They note that this offer is capped at €50 in CRO per purchase.
Payments are among the most important use cases for blockchain technology. Crypto is used for direct payments less frequently than some might suspect, however. As Cointelegraph reported in mid-March, under 1% of Australians used cryptocurrencies to pay for services last year.
Also in March, major cryptocurrency firm Bakkt announced a new direct payment integration which allows customers to pay for Starbucks’ coffee with Bitcoin.
