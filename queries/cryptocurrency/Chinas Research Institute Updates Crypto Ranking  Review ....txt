The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released its latest update of crypto project rankings on Friday. Before this, the rankings were last updated in February when the same 37 projects were evaluated. In addition to the overall ranking, the center assessed the crypto projects based on three additional categories: basic technology, applicability, and creativity. The CCID updates its rankings every two months; this time around is the 17th update and the second this year.
This month, EOS remains top of the overall ranking, followed by Tron and then Ethereum. Bitcoin fell slightly from the 11th place to the 14th place while Bitcoin Cash rose from the 34th place to the 31st place.
The CCID’s 17th crypto project rankings show EOS occupying the top spot overall, followed by Tron and Ethereum. The projects were also evaluated in three additional categories.
The 37 projects were also evaluated in three sub-categories in the same way as previous updates. In the first sub-category, basic technology, EOS tops the list, followed by Tron and IOST. The center explained:
From February to March 2020, due to the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic, the update of selected public chain projects slowed down, and the overall index has not changed much.
The CCID’s crypto project evaluation work was affected by the covid-19 crisis. According to the center, some updates were slowed down by the coronavirus pandemic so the overall ranking has not changed much.
For the second sub-category, applicability, Ethereum tops the ranking, followed by Tron, and Nebulas. For the last sub-category, creativity, BTC scored significantly higher than the other crypto projects, followed by EOS and Ethereum.
The rankings are compiled by the CCID (Qingdao) Blockchain Research Institute, an entity established by the CCID. The evaluation work is carried out in collaboration with several organizations, such as the CCID think tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the center previously explained.
