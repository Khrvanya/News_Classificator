Merely weeks after the launch of John McAfee’s privacy token GHOST, the coin is already seeing real-life utilization in Hong Kong Disneyland.
The team behind the project also announced several upcoming features, including a “decentralized crowdfunding” platform and the release of the GHOST Cell Phone Service beta.
The former antivirus software tycoon and popular cryptocurrency proponent John McAfee announced its newest digital asset endeavor in April. Called GHOST, it’s a privacy coin aiming to enhance users’ online privacy making them “nothing but a ‘ghost’ when transaction online.”
Despite initial criticism of plagiarizing the whitepaper, the token was successfully launched in late May as planned. In this relatively short period for a new coin, GHOST has already experienced real-life utilization, as McAfee announced himself recently:
“GHOST now being used at Disneyland in Hong Kong. Slowly but surely, the world is recognizing what we have done. And there are way, way more features coming in the next three months.”
This integration came after GHOST partnered with the cryptocurrency payment system ivendPay to deploy the coin in over 60 vending machines across Hong Kong. Among those are also machines used in the Disneyland theme park, allowing visitors to purchase goods with their GHOST tokens.
