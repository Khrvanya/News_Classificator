HashCash Consultants plans to release the latest crypto asset promising profit potential amid the atrophying global economy and coronavirus catastrophe.
CFIX will be paired against Tether ( USDT ) and is slated for launch on April 2.
As such, Hashcash’s website states that the overall mission of the project is “to prevent the depletion of resources required for the development of advanced treatments, vaccines, and drugs.”
The firm is accepting applications from non-profits, and does not appear to have the names of any partner charities listed on its website.
According to HashCash Consultants CEO, Raj Chowdhury, CFIX’s development was motivated by the firm’s “aim to provide financial aid to nonprofits and research organizations battling the COVID-19 crisis.”
“The ETF backing incentivizes CFIX, which benefits not only the traders but enables us to raise more funds for all who are affected by Novel Coronavirus, which is the ultimate goal of this initiative,” Chowdhury added.
On Feb. 12, developers from 4Chan launched ‘CoronaCoin’ (NCOV) — an ERC-20 token with a supply corresponding to the world’s population that will undergo a burn every 48 hours based on the number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities.
Despite the claims of NCOV’s developers, the price of CoronaCoin is down 83% in 30 days, and lost 20% from just $16,244 in volume over the past 24 hours.
Cointelegraph reached out to HashCash Consultants and did not receive a response as of press time.
