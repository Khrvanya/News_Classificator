Batten down the hatches and hide away your cattle, as we are just under a month away from the launch of THQ Nordic's Destroy All Humans! This remake of the 2005 action title - built from the ground-up by Black Forest Games - will beam down on PS4, PC, and Xbox One in July.
A new video from THQ Nordic sees our ray-wielding hero Cryptosporidium 137 (you can call him "Crypto") visit the humble Americana of Santa Modesta, where he indulges in some human-zapping, restaurant-destroying and tank-obliterating mayhem. Whether on foot, donning a jetpack, or taking to the skies in his UFO, Crypto is making a healthy living making life unhealthy for the residents of '50s suburbia. And if all that wasn't enough, he can screw with your TV reception too. Little bastard.
Destroy All Humans! launches on PS4, PC, and Xbox One July 28.
