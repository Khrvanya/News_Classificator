16 June 2020: Rapper Akon has agreed on a $6 billion deal to build a futuristic new ‘crypto city’ in Senegal.
Akon City, which will be built just outside the capital of Dakar, has been in the works for several years, with the musician announcing back in 2018 that he planned to construct ‘a real-life Wakanda.’
His ambitions look set to become a reality, as news emerges that Akon has awarded a construction contract for the metropolis.
Details are limited, but Akon City will include a hospital, mall, police station, school, and houses and hotels – all designed in futuristic style, based on the renders Akon shared via Instagram.
The musician is also planning a solar power plant, suggesting the new city will prioritise green energy. Inhabitants will buy goods and services using Akon’s own cryptocurrency AKoins, which will form the basis of Akon City’s economy.
Reports suggest the first phase will be completed by 2023, with a second phase finishing in 2029, by which point the city is expected to be up and running.
