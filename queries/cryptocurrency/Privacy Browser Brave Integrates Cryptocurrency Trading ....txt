Users of the privacy-oriented Brave browser now have the ability to trade cryptocurrencies directly within the software interface, thanks to a partnership between its maker, Brave Software, and cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Announcing the partnership on Tuesday, Brave Software detailed:
The new Binance widget in the new tab page of the Brave desktop browser makes Brave the only browser that offers integrated functionality for buying and trading cryptocurrency.
Privacy browser Brave has added a Binance widget for cryptocurrency trading. An early version of this new feature is available in Brave’s Nightly desktop version now and will be fully released for desktops in April.
“With the Binance widget, Brave users can access the Binance.com and Binance.us (for US-based users) sites, buy and sell crypto assets, view asset balances, and obtain deposit addresses all without leaving the browser,” the announcement continued. “The Binance widget will give Brave users various options to manage cryptocurrencies, including buying, depositing, trading, and viewing summaries. Users will be able to trade cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, litecoin, and many others supported by Binance.” Bitcoin cash ( BCH ) is also included.
An early version of this new feature is available in Brave’s Nightly desktop version now; it will be fully released for desktops in April, and mobile platform availability will be announced at a later date. “The new tab page Binance widget will be enabled by default, but users can turn it off and hide it directly from the new tab page or by managing their settings if they wish,” Brave explained.
Brave Software, the company behind the privacy browser, was founded by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy. Eich created Javascript and co-founded Mozilla while Bondy used to work for Khan Academy and Mozilla. Brave is available on desktop as well as for iOS and Android devices.
The number of Brave users has steadily grown over the years. With only 1 million monthly active users at the beginning of 2018, the privacy browser is now used by more than 12 million monthly active users and over 500,000 verified publishers, the company said on Tuesday. “The Brave browser combines privacy with a blockchain-based digital advertising platform, and offers 3-6x faster browsing than other browsers,” Brave claims.
Brave claims that it has more than 12 million active monthly users. They can now buy and sell major cryptocurrencies through global cryptocurrency exchange Binance without leaving the browser.
An increasing number of people are looking for the best privacy browser or the most secure browser to protect their activities online. Brave is one of several browsers that aim to deliver privacy when browsing the internet.
For added privacy, the Onion Routing network Tor has been integrated into the Brave browser. “Private Tabs with Tor help protect Brave users from ISPs (Internet Service Providers), guest Wi-Fi providers, and visited sites that may be watching their Internet connection or even tracking and collecting IP addresses, a device’s Internet identifier,” Brave detailed. As for the newly added cryptocurrency trading functionality, Brave explained in its Tuesday announcement:
The Binance widget is built into Brave and is not a loaded iframe (remotely embedded document), which preserves the user’s privacy. API calls will only be made into Binance if the user authenticates via OAuth and interacts with the widget.
