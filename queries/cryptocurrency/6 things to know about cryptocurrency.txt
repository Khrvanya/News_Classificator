It might be a surprising fact to learn, but even today there is no one real owner of cryptocurrency. Hence, the founder is a ghost. The acclaimed owner, Satoshi Nakamoto, has not even claimed the ownership for himself in all these years. Cryptocurrency is hence the home for nobody and the home for everybody!!!!
Another interesting fact about cryptocurrency is that it is very volatile in terms of price.

Some cryptocurrency, like bitcoin for example, can be fractionated which allows investors or buyers to invest in about one-tenth of a currency. For example, if a bitcoin sells for 200 dollars, you can decide to buy half or one-quarter of a bitcoin for less. This will not only allow for many investors to invest and gain more value as time progresses but also present a chance for small scale investors to participate.
Just like any other private transaction, it is expected that you should generate an access code that must not get lost. This is because the value of your cryptocurrencies lie with the code. You should protect the code, as you will not be able to generate another when misplaced. In a nutshell, your code is your money.
Even though bitcoin is the most popular because it is the first currency whose use can be traced back, there are about 1500 cryptocurrencies around the World and the counting is still going on. Unlike bitcoin, there are also many currencies whose market cap sum up to above a billion dollars, meaning that the industry is still growing, and quickly.
