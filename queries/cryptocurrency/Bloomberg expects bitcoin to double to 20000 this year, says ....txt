The most popular cryptocurrency has so many favorable fundamental and technical factors that "something needs to go really wrong for bitcoin to not appreciate," Bloomberg said.
The company said history indicated that bitcoin should return to $20,000 in 2020, representing roughly double its current levels.
"Bitcoin will approach the record high of about $20,000 this year, in our view, if it follows 2016's trend," Bloomberg said.
Bitcoin's maturation, fueled by the growing acceptance of digital currencies, the ability to trade bitcoin futures, and a steady decline in volatility, should keep it tilted toward price appreciation, the research note said.
Additionally, Bloomberg said it expected bitcoin to appreciate if the stock market rolls over.
Bloomberg said it thinks bitcoin is benefiting from the coronavirus pandemic, for several reasons.
First, historic declines in equity markets because of the virus didn't spill over to bitcoin, as a brief dip in the cryptocurrency was "promptly rejected," Bloomberg said.
Second, the virus is accelerating the shift away from paper currency toward digital.
And third, new quantitative-easing policies from central banks around the globe are "helping independent stores-of-value such as gold and bitcoin," Bloomberg said.
But Bloomberg's bullish view on bitcoin doesn't translate to other cryptocurrencies like ether.
"We see little upside in the ETH price absent a rising tide from bitcoin," Bloomberg said, adding that bitcoin "is breaking away from the pack in terms of adoption and is supported by almost-ideal macroeconomic conditions for stores-of-value amid quantitative easing."
Bloomberg joins other influential investors in being bullish on bitcoin, including the hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones and the billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya .
Bitcoin traded up 1%, to $9,762, on Wednesday.
