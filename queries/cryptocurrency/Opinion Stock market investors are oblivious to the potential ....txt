Please click here for an annotated chart of January fed funds futures.
• The first chart gives a long-term perspective.
• The first chart shows that after touching the top band of the “mother of support zones,” the stock market is threatening to break above the low band of the resistance zone. From a technical perspective, this is normal behavior. However, when you take into account the overall economic picture and fundamentals, it is a different story.
• The second chart shows that January fed funds futures have gone negative. A value above 100 indicates negative rates.
• As a note of caution, the Federal Reserve has not announced negative interest rates at this time. Futures simply indicate expectations by the market that the Fed will announce negative interest rates by January.
• In our analysis at The Arora Report, calling negative interest rates “evil” is not too strong a word.
• Japan and Europe already have negative interest rates. Have you taken a look at the perpetual anemic growth rates in Japan and Europe? In our analysis, those economies are decaying. In contrast, the U. S. has vigor and the potential for strong growth. Hopefully our leaders will realize that negative interest rates in Europe and Japan have failed and will stay away from them. But hope is not a good investment strategy. Investors should, for the first time in history, start considering a scenario of negative interest rates in the U.S.
