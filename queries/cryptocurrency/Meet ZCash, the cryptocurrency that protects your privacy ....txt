ZCash protects users’ privacy efficiently by using the zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to execute transactions without revealing user’s privacy.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a domino effect on everything, from increased government surveillance, to global economics, climate change, protests, and financial markets.
Fears of government surveillance have strengthened around the world due to the many global events that have occurred and continue to happen, this year.
Therefore, concerns on protecting personal data have fueled the use of privacy-centric digital assets such as ZCash.
What you must know about ZCash: ZCash is a digital coin with a decentralized blockchain that looks to supply anonymity for the users that patronize it and their transactions. It protects users’ privacy efficiently by using the zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to execute transactions without revealing information that could expose a user’s privacy.
As a cryptocurrency, ZCash possesses comparable properties to Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, it also includes an open-source code, but what sets them apart lies in the level of privacy and changeability that each provides.
According to Coinmarketcap, ZCash is ranked as the 27th most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $477.5 million dollars.
Consequently, the amount of fully shielded ZCash (ZEC) transactions has been on a surge in the last three months. Between the periods of April and June, ZCash has been hovering around the $500 million market capitalization mark, higher than previous quarters where its market capitalization stood at $200-400 million.
At the time this report was drafted, ZCash was trading at $51.20.
This is an indicator that it will continue to strengthen as private transactions will be a key future feature on all major blockchains due to an increase in global demand for privacy.

From a macro level, this increase in the number of BTC whales can be considered bullish.
At the BTC market, BTC whales have been increasing at a steady pace after Bitcoin’s recent halving, as data seen from Glassnode show that there are currently more than 1,800 Bitcoin (BTC) whales.
Quick fact about BTC whales: In the Bitcoin world, investors or traders who own a large number of Bitcoins are typically called Bitcoin whales. This means a Bitcoin whale would be an individual or business entity (with a single Bitcoin address) owning around 1000 Bitcoins or more.
Whales could be anticipating a strong medium to long-term Bitcoin price trend, and are choosing to hold on to BTC expecting a bull market. Eichholz explained:
“Where did all these new whales come from? Much of the recent increase can be attributed to wealthy entities withdrawing their BTC from exchanges. Apparently, this is not new wealth – rather, it represents a change in the way Bitcoin whales are choosing to hold their coins.”
From a macro level, this increase in the number of BTC whales can be considered bullish.
As BTC whales accumulate BTCs, Bitcoins circulating supply reduces, and this can weaken any bearish trend BTC finds itself in. Meaning that over time, it’s possible that as Bitcoin approaches its fixed supply of 21 million, the price of BTC will go up, with BTC’s present demand factored in.
“While there is no single explanation of what caused these large holders to withdraw their BTC from exchanges, [Bitcoin exchange outflows] suggests that whales may have used Black Thursday as an opportunity to get in at the bottom and then withdraw their bitcoin to HODL for the longer term in anticipation of the next Bull Run.”
BTCs moving from the investment bucket into the trading bucket could become a crucial source of liquidity.
Data obtained from a crypto analytic firm, Glassnode revealed that 13,000 BTC wallets are now worth at least $1,000,000, showing the numbers of BTC whales are increasing on a daily basis.

With more people looking to trade bitcoin, which is only becoming scarcer following the recent halving, BTCs moving from the investment bucket into the trading bucket could become a crucial source of liquidity. However, one would expect this will only happen if bitcoin’s price rises to a level at which long-term investors are willing to sell,” Chainalysis researchers wrote.
Chainalysis a leading crypto analytic firm also explained activities in the BTC market for the month of June. The report said;
“As of June 2020, roughly 18.6 million Bitcoin has been mined. We break that 18.6 million Bitcoin down into three buckets based on its movements to date.
“Roughly 60% of that Bitcoin is held by entities — either people or businesses — that have never sold more than 25% of Bitcoin they’ve ever received, and have often held on to that Bitcoin for many years, which we label as Bitcoin held for long-term investment.”
At the time this report was drafted, Bitcoin was still trading below the $9200 resistance levels, as investors, traders keep buying BTCs below these support levels.

Recall that Glasscode, recently said, “the price of BTC is now more than 20x higher than it was when we first saw this many whales, implying that more wealth is being held by whales.”
“However, the average balance held by each whale has decreased during this period, such that whales actually hold less BTC now than in 2016, and less wealth (in USD terms) than in 2017,” it added.
It’s also important to note that BTC whales tend to sell their huge stacks of BTC on the bitcoin market when crypto exchanges are quiet in order to attract attention, the CEO of on-chain analysis provider, CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, who had been studying BTC’s trend had said.
