The bitcoin price has failed to move convincingly above $10,000 per bitcoin so far this year.
In March, bitcoin briefly crashed to under $4,000 amid a wider coronavirus-induced sell-off but rebounded in the run up to its closely-watched May supply squeeze, known as a halving.
Meanwhile, bitcoin has continued to mirror global stock markets as equities in Asia and Europe begin the week in the red.
"Markets around the world have sold off again on heightened fears around a second wave of coronavirus infections and deaths," said Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell.
Over the weekend, Beijing recorded a small number of new locally-transmitted coronavirus cases, causing China authorities to reimpose some lockdown measures in the country's capital.
Despite its latest fall, the bitcoin price is still up around 30% since the beginning of the year, with many bullish members of the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community hopeful the market could return to its all-time highs in 2020.

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
