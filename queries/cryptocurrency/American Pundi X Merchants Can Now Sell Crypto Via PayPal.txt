As the crypto community’s anticipation for PayPal’s exploration into crypto grows, Pundi X has integrated the payments processor for its point-of-sale devices.
PayPal is the first mobile payment gateway to be integrated onto Xpos, and users from more than 30 countries can now accept funds via the payments processor.
The integration will take place over two stages, with U.S-based merchants who use Xpos able to apply for PayPay-based keyed transactions from July 1.
A PayPal app is expected to be integrated onto all Xpos devices within two weeks — completing the roll-out.
Pundi X decided to launch the integration after conducting a Twitter poll asking followers which mobile payment app they would like Xpos to support first.
PayPal received almost 70% of votes, beating out WeChat Pay, Alipay, and GoPay, among others.
The integration brings credit card payments to Pundi X’s point-of-sale system, and allows cryptocurrencies to be purchased via PayPal from supporting Xpos merchants.
Pundi X chief executive and co-founder Zac Cheah emphasized that integrations with leading global firms such as PayPal will help drive adoption blockchain-based services and products outside of the crypto community:
“To be able to support a leading online payment provider in our XPOS devices can give people more confidence in using them, and can move usage of blockchain technology closer to the mainstream."
After shunning cryptocurrencies for a decade, recent job listings for blockchain engineers responsible for “ new initiatives ” at PayPal global appear to support rumours it will soon offer cryptocurrency sales to users.
PayPal payments are only supported by a handful of crypto exchanges, such as peer-to-peer marketplaces Localbitcoins and Paxful.
Last week, KuCoin’s P2P Fiat Market became the latest P2P platform to support PayPal, introducing the payment gateway alongside support for USD.
