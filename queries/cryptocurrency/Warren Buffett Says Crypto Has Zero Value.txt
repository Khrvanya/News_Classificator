Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, continued his public aversion to cryptocurrency by once again disavowing it as having no value, according to a report by CNBC .
“Cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don’t produce anything,” he said recently. “In terms of value: zero. I don’t have any cryptocurrency and I never will.”
This is hardly the first time Buffett has spoken out against crypto . In 2018, before his company’s annual shareholders’ meeting, he said crypto was “probably rat poison squared.” He has also called it a “mirage,” “not currency” and “tulips.”
Last year, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency TRON and CEO of file-sharing company BitTorrent, bid $4.57 million during a charity auction to have dinner with Buffett in an attempt to change his mind.
“When Justin and four friends came, they behaved perfectly and we had a very friendly (three-and-a-half-hour) dinner, and the whole thing was a very friendly exchange of ideas,” Buffett said.
Earlier this month , Berkshire Hathaway made an investment in grocery chain Kroger and caused the company’s shares to spike. Buffett bought 19 million shares and Kroger’s stock went up 6 percent. Berkshire is now one of the largest 10 shareholders in Kroger.
A similar thing happened in November, when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that Berkshire Hathaway owned 1.2 million shares in furniture retailer RH , also known as Restoration Hardware. When the news was revealed, shares in RH spiked 7.5 percent in after-hours trading.
It was also revealed that Berkshire got a stake in Occidental Petroleum, and also that it got rid of some of its Wells Fargo stake, to the tune of 7.7 percent.
