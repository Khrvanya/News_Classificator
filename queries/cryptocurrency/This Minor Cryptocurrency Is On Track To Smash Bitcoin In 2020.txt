The tezos price is up some 40% over the last 12 months, outpacing bitcoin's rally.
"Tezos is not a proof-of-work based coin, so it can't be mined," said Joe DiPasquale, chief executive of hedge fund manager BitBull Capital .
"However, it is one of the more promising projects to come out of the initial coin offering-era, which gives it an edge in times such as these, when the bitcoin price appreciates and lifts the market for a select-few, quality projects."
Tezos has benefited from various platforms supporting the ability to "stake" tezos tokens over recent months, according to DiPasquale, who pointed to the U.S. division of major bitcoin and crypto exchange Binance, "which is also a positive driver for price."
The tezos rally, which began in November last year, has also been pushed on by major partnerships with the financial world and the so-called Tezos Foundationâ€™s Faucet, that awards users up to 0.01 XTZ every 12 hours.

As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
