So far, the receiver has issued notices to numerous banks in Canada and the U.S., “as well as Cannacord Genuity in Vancouver,” the filings say, “where Gokturk and/or Einstein Group may have deposits or investments.”
The receiver has also seized shares in various private companies, and is investigating whether Gokturk or others have “beneficial” interests in various accounts.
Gokturk could not be reached for comment by Global News, and he has not responded to the allegations in BCSC case filings.
However, filings say the Einstein Group has informed the receiver that it believes it owes customers between US$8 and $10 million.
The company claims “this deficit stems for a series of credit card and bank draft frauds that the Einstein Group suffered, and that the majority of this loss is made up of cryptocurrency assets.”
The company had about 200,000 clients around the world, and the receiver has so far received inquiries from between two and three hundred customers.
The receiver immediately moved to secure company records on Nov. 1, filings say, “but was stalled for approximately ten days while Einstein Group and Mr. Gokturk retained legal counsel.”
