The rapid drive towards greater digital mobility, and computing in more forms, in more places, has meant the...connectivity capabilities of our businesses have had to scramble to keep up. Across Wi-Fi, wired, and mobile networks, weâ€™re having to transport ever more data, more quickly, from more locations, more reliably, for less money. All while supporting the multi-cloud and SaaS-based environments in which businesses now operate. This webinar will discuss the key motivations driving these trends, how can organisations increase capability without spiralling complexity and costs, and why should they avoid opting for a cheaper version of yesterday.
In this season of Deskflix you will hear from peers on how they have succeeded despite managing: low budget, skills...shortage, working with outdated equipment, and regional remote teams.
This webinar, will draw on the latest developments, trends and experiences in malware to explore what best practice...for malware prevention and remediation looks like today. It will discuss incident frequency and remediation times, financial and reputational implications, and reveal what organisations should be doing differently to quickly recover from a malware attack.
