“In short, while Covid-19 is providing some scammers with new fraudulent stories to entice victims, the cryptocurrency price drops spurred by the pandemic have drastically reduced the revenue potential of the biggest scams.”
Amongst the various cryptocurrency coronavirus-themed scams are phishing emails promising treatments for the virus and some blackmail attempts where crooks are claiming to have COVID-19 and threaten to spread it to the recipient’s family unless they pay.
Meanwhile, Microsoft also had some (relatively) good news to share on the COVID-19 cybercrime climate. Its researchers found that roughly 60,000 of the millions of phishing emails it sees every day include COVID-19 related malicious attachments or links. That’s still less than 2% of the daily threats Microsoft tracks.
Microsoft also found that there hasn’t been an overall jump in cyberattacks during this unprecedented period. “Our data shows that these COVID-19 themed threats are retreads of existing attacks that have been slightly altered to tie to this pandemic. This means we’re seeing a changing of lures, not a surge in attacks,” it wrote in a post on Wednesday.
Not that coronavirus-themed threats aren’t a concern. Microsoft found that China, Russia and the U.S. have been hit the hardest, and created a map showing where COVID-19 phishing emails were landing.

Earlier this week, the U.S. and U.K. governments released a joint report in which they revealed a list of 2,500 malicious websites and email addresses that were being used by cybercriminals trying to exploit fears around the pandemic.
