Mark Hipperson , a co-founder and former CTO of British neobank Starling Bank, is today announcing £5.25 million in seed funding for his latest venture, cryptocurrency exchange platform Ziglu .
Somewhat oddly, the names of the investors were not disclosed – only that it involves “a number of specialist UK FinTech investors, and entrepreneurs.”
Ziglu provides a digital platform that enables customers to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency – Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash – with zero hidden fees or transaction charges, and to monitor their balances in real-time. Of course, it has a plethora of competitors.
Says Hipperson: “As we gear up for our next stage of development, we are delighted to have oversold our seed funding and welcome our new investors. This significant cash injection allows us to deliver an exciting product with an innovation cycle, fast and responsive to customer needs.”
