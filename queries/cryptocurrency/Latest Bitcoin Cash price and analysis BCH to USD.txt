Bitcoin Cash has presented a notable bearish scenario as it moves into the typically low volume weekend of price action, with it languishing down around the $230 level of support.
The world’s fifth largest cryptocurrency, which famously spawned out of a Bitcoin hard fork in December 2017, has remained stable in terms of price over the past three months.
The daily 200 moving average remains a key hurdle for Bitcoin Cash in the short and medium term, with it causing four succinct rejections since the first test on April 8.
Until it can break above the 200MA the overall picture remains bearish with an eventual slide to the $204 level of support seeming likely over the coming months.
Much of the upcoming price action will depend on Bitcoin and whether it breaks out above $10,500 or breaks below $9,000.
A bullish break, coupled with the recent halving event, would bode well for the entire cryptocurrency market as profits typically flow from Bitcoin into more speculative bets like altcoins.
However, a break down in price would cause an adverse move in the value of altcoins, as traders need to move back into Bitcoin in order to liquidate back into fiat currency.
As noted in Coin Rivet’s daily analysis yesterday, the potential impact of a covid-19 second spike remains the largest threat to global capital markets due to its unpredictable nature.
