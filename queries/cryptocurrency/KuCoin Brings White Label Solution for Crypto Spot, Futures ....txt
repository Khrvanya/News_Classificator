Major exchanges like Binance and Huobi are also offering similar services.
KuCoin, a global digital asset trading platform, on Thursday announced the launch of a white-label solution, allowing its clients to set up fully functional crypto exchanges in 72 hours.
Dubbed KuCloud, the solution will offer two products – XCoin and XMEX – which will deliver the functionalities of the KuCoin Spot platform and KuMEX Futures platform, respectively.
The announcement also detailed that local exchanges can offer features like spot trading, margin trading, staking, and a fiat gateway to as much as 150x leverage futures trading with KuCloud. In addition, the platform is also customizable and can be moulded per the clients’ needs.

“Now we go one step further and upgrade the ‘subnets’ to KuCloud, eliminating the difficulties and hassle of opening a crypto exchange, allowing all our partners to build crypto-related platforms with us to contribute to the liquidity and mass adoption of crypto,” Lyu added.
KuCoin’s cloud solution came just days after Binance unveiled a similar product . Binance Cloud can also be used in the future to launch virtual tokens via an IEO (initial exchange offering) platform and introduce the OTC trading service. Moreover, the platform also enables brokers, fund managers, and token issuers to quickly develop new revenue streams and access Binance’s native liquidity.
Last year, Huobi also released a similar product and specifically targeted the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
To stand out in a competitive market like this, KuCoin is offering an early-bird special of launching a crypto exchange for free for its initial customers.
