Beaxy.com today announced the upcoming launch of its revolutionary trading app. Nick Murphy, Beaxy.com CEO talks about the new platform and why they built it:
“For years, we’ve yearned for a trading experience that matches how we live. Yet, they’ve all been found wanting. It’s as if whoever builds these platforms still rides in cabs, the actual yellow checkered ones, or pays for things with one of those plastic credit cards. You know, the ones you physically have to touch, stick into a machine and have an actual wallet to carry them in, making one side of your butt inevitably bulkier than the other? Those people.
In short, everything in the trading space is boring, takes too long, is full of squiggly lines and graphs and charts and other things that one must pay attention to, and who’s got the time for that?
But crypto is lit and likely will be for a long time to come. And we wanted in on the party. So we built a trading platform that’s like us: fast-moving, world-changing and always on!
