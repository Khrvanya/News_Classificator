WorldCoinIndex has launched a cryptocurrency derivative market data platform.
Launched in 2014, WorldCoinIndex has been serving the cryptocurrency community for over six years. Over this timeframe, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has developed at a rapid pace, and it doesnâ€™t seem to be slowing down. Many new exchanges have joined the business, whereas a variety of new products and services from the traditional financial markets have entered the cryptocurrency space.
Digital currency derivatives represent such an example, given their status as a high-potential and innovative development on the market.
WorldCoinIndex aggregates information of daily trade volume and open interest from over 900 cryptocurrency derivatives contracts. The derivatives market is categorised in Perpetuals, Futures, and Options - data on each is available via our platform.
At this time, Bitcoin holds the leading rank in the cryptocurrency market and thus, it is natural to see that most of the new derivatives contracts are set for this coin. In fact, 60 per cent of the volume and number of contracts is dominated by Bitcoin. There are a couple of smaller choices as well, such as Ethereum and Ripple, but we expect this market to grow as it reaches maturity. In the long run, other cryptocurrencies will likely be offered.
The average daily volume for crypto derivatives is USD40 billion, with an open interest of USD5 billion.
