tap, the world’s first truly unified crypto banking app that launched to the public on the 24th February 2020 is the only company in Europe currently operating a MasterCard regulated to hold customers' crypto.  Regulated to trade and store customers' digital assets by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, tap is in essence, bridging the gap between traditional and non-traditional currency.  This allows both seasoned and new crypto traders to not only access funds quickly but also pay day-to-day expenses using their crypto assets via Mastercard.  A revolutionary approach to personal finance.
Tap.global is paving the path to facilitate this transitioning economy by combining modern banking with crypto trading through their multi-coin e-wallet. The Tap app users in the EEA  have the option of adding the  Tap Prepaid Mastercard that is linked to the user’s account, the user can choose any crypto asset or cash balance held to fund the purchase with their tap Prepaid Mastercard.
With over 5k customers already using the app, the tap account comes with multiple crypto and fiat wallets and have access to real time crypto trading with numerous exchanges.  All assets are held securely in multi signatory insured “cold storage” wallets or as segregated electronic money accounts with the tap e-money partner.
Arsen Torosian (26yrs), tap Founder / CEO, said:
“Crypto needn’t be on the opposite end of the financial spectrum.  With a growing market landscape and positive outlook for cryptocurrencies, what we do is combine the legacy of traditional banking with the allure of the crypto market to allow customers to easily access their crypto and use this as an additional or alternative method of personal finance.
“We are the only app with a Mastercard operating in Europe enabling users to instantly transform digital assets into wealth.  The crypto tide is happening, and financial institutions who ride the wave could come out on top.”
tap currently supports three cryptocurrencies: BTC, ETH, LTC and three fiat currencies: US Dollars($), EURO, pounds sterling(£), In the future tap will expand these supported currencies to any cryptocurrency with a daily traded volume of $1m+ and the top 14 fiat currencies supported by the card scheme.
