Assume Sarah buys $10,000 worth of Company A stocks (1,000 shares at $10 each)  on January 10, 2020. On January 15, 2020, Company A stock is trading at a much lower price of $6 per share. If Sarah were to sell her position and buy another 1,000 shares at $6 per share, she would NOT be able to claim the capital loss of $4,000 (($10 - $6) x 1,000) due to wash sale rule. Therefore, $4,000 loss is disallowed under wash sale rule.
In contrast, trading cryptocurrencies which act just like “stocks”, but under the tax treatment of “property”, generate a much better tax benefit. Let’s say instead of buying Company A stocks, on January 10, 2020, Sarah buys 1 BTC at $10,000. On January 15, 2020, this BTC goes down to $7,000. At this point, what she could do is sell the BTC for $7,000, harness $3,000 ($10,000 - $7,000) worth of tax losses and buy back another bitcoin to maintain her position. $3,000 loss would be allowed on your tax return as a capital loss because BTC is not subject to wash sale rules like stocks.
This is a great strategy to implement throughout the year and/or whenever you have positions which have gone down in value. Another advantage here is that losses created from this crypto tax loophole can also help you offset capital gains arising from other stocks & security transactions, leading to a lower overall tax bill.
