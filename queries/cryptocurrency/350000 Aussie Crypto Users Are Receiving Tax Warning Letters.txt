Interestingly, the ATO letters seem to be targeting a large number of crypto users irrespective of the size of their crypto holdings. Generally, tax authorities like the IRS are more inclined to focus on cases with high dollar amounts to justify the cost of administration.
Tax treatment for cryptocurrencies under Australian tax code is similar to the US tax code for the most part. Under the Australian tax code, crypto currencies are treated as a “form of asset” and subject to capital gains taxes. Therefore, selling, trading or exchanging cryptocurrency and converting it into Australian dollars or a foreign currency or using it to obtain goods or services can trigger taxable events. Record keeping is also essential similar to the US tax system. Recipients of ATO crypto tax notices should seek out a reliable cryptocurrency tax software to complete their tax filing (or amend previous returns).
