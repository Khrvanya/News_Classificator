The Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange (LCX) and social analytics platform LunarCRUSH will be working together to provide crypto market insights on security tokens.
According to a June 29 press release available to Cointelegraph, the two firms have taken the first steps to form a partnership which will provide crypto market insights for security tokens and other compliant digital assets.
LCX and LunarCRUSH will be combining their talents “to deliver community insights, research, background information, historical and real-time market data to crypto investors and traders.” The announcement stated the partnership will help provide data for better crypto trading and investment decisions.
