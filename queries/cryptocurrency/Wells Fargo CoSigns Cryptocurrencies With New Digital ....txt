Last year, Goldman Sachs became the first regulated financial institution to allow its clients to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks. The legitimacy bar for digital currencies was raised at this point. The Wall Street titan proceeded cautiously and didn’t trade actual Bitcoin initially, instead the bank used its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients. Also, they traded non-delivery useable forward futures where trades settled in the regulated currency they’re quoted in.
While Goldman Sachs dips its toes in the cryptocurrency markets, CultureBanx found BitMEX is way ahead of the game. CEO Arthur Hayes helms this leading cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The company offers derivative products to retail investors and has a daily trading volume approaching $3 billion. BitMEX made revenue of $83 million in 2017 and posted $21 million in revenue during January of 2018.
What’s Next: Wells Fargo’s stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar and the pilot program is planned for 2020. The concept will undergo a test for internal transfers, with a goal to expand to multi-currency transfers in the future.
