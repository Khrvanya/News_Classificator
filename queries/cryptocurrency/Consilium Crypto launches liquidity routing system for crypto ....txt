Consilium Crypto, a provider of institutional-grade trading & risk management tools for digital asset markets, has launched a liquidity routing system for cryptocurrency exchanges, Consilium ORS.
This product has multiple one of a kind features built in, designed to meet the needs of high-volume crypto traders (hedge funds, miners, OTC trading desks).
High-volume clients can save 10 per cent and more on transactions of select coins including Ethereum, Litecoin and Zcash. Consilium ORS also significantly improves pricing on Bitcoin and other digital assets, spreading orders across multiple exchanges to avoid disrupting prices, enabling users to get more for their money. Furthermore, there is no fixed cost for this service. Costs are a function of the trader’s savings. If customers don’t save on a transaction, they pay zero.
Consilium Crypto offers a streamlined Liquidity Routing System that does not require custody of funds, a new concept in this type of trading. Consilium Crypto users keep complete control over all their assets, from quote to execution. All trading is done directly between the user and the exchange, reducing the risk of cyber attacks.
“We started this company three years ago aiming to build a crypto hedge fund” says CEO Austin Hubbell. “First, we built the tools and technology we would need to run a hedge fund ourselves because we didn’t like what was out there. Once we started down that path, we quickly realised this sector was ripe for disruption. There is a better way to buy and sell digital assets at scale, and we believe this is it.”
