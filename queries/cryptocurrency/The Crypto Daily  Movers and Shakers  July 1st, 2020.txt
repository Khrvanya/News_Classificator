Bitcoin would need to move through the $9,145 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $9,212.47.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Tuesday’s high $9,206.5.
Barring an extended crypto rebound, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high would likely cap any upside.
In the event of a crypto breakout, Bitcoin could test the second major resistance level at $9,274.23 and $9,300 levels before any pullback.
Failure to move through the $9,145 pivot level could see Bitcoin struggle on the day.
A fall back through to sub-$9,100 would bring the first major support level at $9,082.97 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should avoid the 23.6% FIB of $8,900. The second major support level at $9,015.23 should limit any downside on the day.
