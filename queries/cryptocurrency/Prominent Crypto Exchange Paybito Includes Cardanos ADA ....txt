Cardano is an open-source decentralized public blockchain network and cryptocurrency project and ADA is its native currency. It is also involved in the development of a smart contract platform that aims to be powered by enhanced features (project under development). Cardano enables intricate and programmable value transfers securely. The Cardano foundation was established by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum in 2015 and he was able to raise 60 million USD through Initial Coin Offering that took place in 2017.
It is considered as the first-ever blockchain platform to have evolved from a scientific philosophy with a research-first driven approach. Cardano is also one of the first to be built using the Haskell programming language. It uses a proof-of-stake algorithm called the Ouroboros which works differently than other proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms.
