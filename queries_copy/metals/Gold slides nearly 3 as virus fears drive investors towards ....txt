Gold dropped nearly 3% on Wednesday as investors dumped precious metals in favour of cash after additional stimulus measures by the United States failed to calm markets hit by mounting fears over the economic downside from the coronavirus.
Spot gold        was down 2.8% to $1,485.06 per ounce. U.S. gold futures        were down 2.4% to $1,488.70.
"Gold continues to suffer from risk-off panics in the market, trading back below $1,500 level as S&P futures gave up stimulus driven gains," said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. "Liquidity here, as in most markets, is deeply compromised and we expect to see continuing volatility, mood-driven swings."

On Wednesday, the Trump Administration asked Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers in two rounds that would start April 6.
"Gold will remain volatile over the next few sessions as investors await to see if the Trump administration is unable to quickly pass its massive stimulus plan," said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA, in a note.
"If we see a repeat of the financial crisis when Congress was ineffective in acting swiftly, the scramble for cash will continue."
Gold prices have plummeted more than 12% or over $200 since surging past $1,700 per ounce last week as investors unloaded bullion in exchange for cash and to meet margin calls.
Among other precious metals, palladium        slipped 2.6% to $1,600.43 per ounce, while platinum        shed 9.1% to $600.84.
