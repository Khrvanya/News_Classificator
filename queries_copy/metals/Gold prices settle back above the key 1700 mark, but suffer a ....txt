Gold prices settle back above the key $1,700 mark, but suffer a weekly decline
Gold futures settled back above the key $1,700-an-ounce mark Friday as renewed concerns over the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on the global economy buoyed haven demand for the metal, but prices still posted a loss for the week.
“The usual uncertainty around the coronavirus and trying to understand what everyone is dealing with is prevailing once again,” said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM.
“Promising headlines that progress is being made on a vaccination for the coronavirus, alongside the gradual reopening of economies” had taken away some of the shine in gold in earlier dealings, he told MarketWatch.
However, the report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy does warn that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last as much as two years,” he said. That would support demand for haven gold.
Gold for June delivery US:GCM20 rose $6.70, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,700.90 an ounce, after losing 1.1% a day ago. The metal, based on the most-active contracts, had put in a gain of 6.1% in April, but suffered a loss of about 2% this week, according to FactSet data.
Risk-off sentiment prevailed among investors Friday, with downbeat U.S. economic data and losses in the stock market contributing to a rise in gold prices. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index fell to 41.5% last month from 49.1% in March. This is the lowest since April 2009.
Meanwhile, U.S. equity markets, having come off the best monthly gains since 1987, traded sharply lower Friday as gold futures settled, with investors searching for clarity on the future in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected more than 3 million people globally and claimed more than 200,000 lives globally.
