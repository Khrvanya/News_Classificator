Perth, Australia, June 17, 2020 - (ABN Newswire) - Hastings Technology Metals Limited (ASX: HAS.AX - News ) (HAM: 5AM.HM - News ) has received a works permit to construct the Yangibana Rare Earths Project (Yangibana Project) process plant under Part V of the Environmental Protection Act 1986 (Western Australia).
Following a rigorous assessment process and a public advertisement period, the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) has issued a works permit subject to conditions for a number of prescribed facilities (i.e. facilities that emit pollutants) at the Yangibana Project including:
Category 73: Bulk storage of chemicals etc.
Of these facilities, the process plant (Category 5 under Schedule 1 of the Environmental Protection Regulations 1987) and the associated tailings storage facilities are the most important. The conditions include design and construction requirements, pollutant emission limits, monitoring requirements and compliance reporting.
The Yangibana Project includes the development of five open pit mines, groundwater abstraction, on-site processing of ore, tailings storage facilities, and supporting infrastructure such as access and haul roads, accommodation facilities, administration buildings and an airstrip.
The company is working on satisfying the approval conditions and when completed, the work can commence subject to financial close for the Yangibana project.
Andrew Reid, Chief Operating Officer commented: "While Hastings has received State and Commonwealth environmental approvals, the additional focus and rigorous nature of this approval process on polluting facilities such as the process plant provides us and our shareholders with further confidence that the Yangibana Project is able to meet the high regulatory standards set by the Western Australian (WA) government. The regulatory standards set by the WA government also provide the international community and our major offtake customer, Schaeffler Technologies AG with assurance that the extraction component of the rare earths supply chain is undertaken in an environmentally responsible manner."
