It is been another extremely volatile day for  gold futures. Beginning from the opening Monday morning in Australia, roughly  22 hours ago, we have seen gold futures basis the most active June contract  trade as low as $1724.20, which was a double-digit decline on the day. As of  4:20 PM gold futures are currently up $12.40, which is a net gain of .71%, and  fixed at $1765.10.
At 12 noon in Honolulu Hawaii, which  corresponds to the opening Monday morning in Australia, we saw gold prices open  and trade fractionally higher before succumbing to profit-taking which took us  to the intraday low of $1724.20. It was buyers entering the market taking gold  to $1741 that prompted me to raise our protective stops yesterday, while we  maintain our long position which we entered on April 1 at $1602.
Although equities globally were weaker but  mixed, it was the decline of U.S. equities today that aided in supporting  higher gold pricing, as the precious yellow metal continues to act as a safe  haven asset. Silver was the only precious metal (gold, silver, palladium and  platinum) of the futures complex to close lower on the day. Quite likely  reacting to lower equities pricing in the U.S. as silver’s industrial component  drove the precious metal down by 2.39%, and after factoring in today’s drawdown  of $0.38, silver futures are currently fixed at $15.67 per ounce. Platinum  gained almost ¾ of a percent, and palladium gained almost 8/10 of a percent on  the day.
On a technical basis we see major support in  gold at $1697 to $1700, which is the 38% Fibonacci retracement of the last leg  of this rally which began on April 1 when gold traded to an intraday low of  $1576, up to today’s high of $1771. There is also support at the 23% Fibonacci  retracement level which occurs at $1726.
More importantly in terms of technical areas we  might find resistance there is a void when we look at the historical data going  back to the middle of 2011 when gold prices hit the highest level on record and  then began to oscillate between $1800 and $1537 per ounce. Simply put on a  technical basis there is no real strong level of resistance until $1800 which  was the ceiling from the end of 2011. Although there is a lot of historical  data between 2012 up until the end of March 2013, there is virtually no  technical resistance between the current price of gold and $1800.
Fundamentally recent action by the current  administration with their payroll loan guarantees, and the Federal Reserve’s  action of cutting rates to near zero and simultaneously adding to their balance  sheet to accommodate their revised monetary policy of quantitative easing are  all adding up to a solid rationale to see gold move higher.
