rose 21 cents, or 1.2%, to end at $17.967 an ounce.
A string of U.S. economic reports that highlight the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic did little to sway gold momentum on the session.
On Thursday, the Labor Department said 2.12 million unemployed Americans applied for state unemployment benefits in the week ended May 23. That is down from 2.4 million in the prior week.
Meanwhile, data showed that the U.S. economy contracted at an annual 5% pace in the first quarter instead of 4.8%, revised government data show. A downward revision to inventory investment mostly accounted for the downward revision, the Commerce Department, while orders for durable goods tumbled 17.2% in April. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a drop of 18.2%.
However, investors have noted that gold has been unable to break toward $1,800 an ounce.
“The stock market remains strongly supported, but it won’t be at the expense of safe-haven selling,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in a daily research note. ‘Gold has struggled to break above $1800 and that the next couple of weeks could be a frustration phase for bullish investors,” he wrote.
