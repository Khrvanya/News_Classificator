The markets for gold, silver, and other precious metals have been as volatile over the last two months as they’ve been at any point in history.
The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has sent gold rallying to 7-year highs. Silver, meanwhile, sold off to an 11-year low in March before regaining roughly half its losses in April. The same goes for platinum, which fell to a 17-year low before regaining half its losses, and copper, which hit a 4-year low before bouncing back.
In the wake of the pandemic’s first wave, some mining companies have fared better than others. Companies with mining operations in South America and West Africa like New Pacific Metals Corp. (otcqx:NUPMF) and Endeavour Mining Corp. (otcqx:EDVMF) have regained the majority of their losses. Others have not been so lucky.
Just like every other industry, a clear line has been drawn in the metals and mining industry: there is pre-COVID-19, and post-COVID-19. And it’s created a host of new questions ranging from the future of mine sites, to transportation restrictions, to key material shortages.
In an attempt to provide clarity on the industry’s present and future, a large group of resource companies is coming together this week at the Metals & Mining Virtual Investor Conference, a Virtual Investor Conference by OTC Markets. Among the presenters are New Pacific Metals, Endeavour Mining, Novo Resources Corp. (otcqx:NSRPF), Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (otcqx:IVPAF), and Midas Gold Corp. (otcqx:MDRPF).
The conference will bring together 33 speakers from 31 companies with operations around the world to address investors directly over two days. Executives are expected to discuss the status of ongoing operations, their liquidity and capital situations, and how they plan to restart production while keeping workers safe. The keynote presentation from Red Cloud Securities VP Of Research Derek Macpherson will address resource investing in a COVID-19 world on a macro level and what companies need to do to make it through this crisis.
Below is the schedule for the conference. Each presentation is followed by a virtual Q&A session with attendees and is available on demand.

Improved company earnings in the quarters ahead and a breakthrough Covid treatment or vaccine could buoy stock prices. But the real catalyst will be government intervention.
