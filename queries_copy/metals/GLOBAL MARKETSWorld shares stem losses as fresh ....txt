NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - Global equity markets bounced back on Friday as investors took in stride the U.S. Federal Reserve’s outlook for a long road to recovery and bet shutdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic were unlikely to be reinstated widely.
All three major U.S. stock indexes rebounded from Thursday’s worst single-day drop in three months, regaining a chunk of their losses. In Europe, the STOXX 600 Index snapped a four-day losing streak to add 0.1%.
Still, gold was heading toward its biggest weekly gain since early April as a jump in COVID-19 cases in some U.S. states fed fears that new economic shutdowns might be put in place.
On Thursday, the S&P 500 slumped 5.9%, its steepest one-session loss since March 16, fueled by the Fed’s warning that the U.S. economy would contract by 6.5% this year.
Despite those concerns, Julie Fox, a managing director for private wealth at UBS Financial Services in New York, saw room for equities to move higher.
“The Fed’s comments highlighted the risks that the economic recovery may not be V-shaped, but it also showed that they’re committed to loosening the financial conditions,” she said.

Despite the rebound, the Dow and S&P 500 were on track to post their worst week in 12 weeks.
Frankfurt’s DAX, Paris’s CAC40 and London’s FTSE were all in positive territory, the latter shrugging off data showing Britain’s economy shrank the most on record in April.
MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.26%, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.91% lower.
