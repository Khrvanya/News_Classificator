ended the near session high, up 16.2 cents, or 0.9%, at $17.757 an ounce.
Earlier gold prices fell as U.S. equities  rose sharply on Tuesday and most were higher again in Wednesday dealings, finding support from optimism over the easing of lockdowns and by fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts by governments and central banks. That dulled some haven demand for gold.
The European Union’s new fiscal stimulus package “will likely be the beginning of another wave of stimulus that should help prop up risky assets,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. The EU is on track to announce a €750 billion ($823 billion) stimulus package, according to news reports.
A loss of gold’s haven appeal could prove “fatal” for the yellow metal amid weak demand from other sources, said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank, noting data from the Swiss Federal Customs Administration on Tuesday that showed the country exported 131.8 [metric] tons of gold in April, the highest volume since last August.
However, a record 111.7 tons went to the U.S., likely to fulfill demand by exchange-traded funds, he said in a note, while exports to Asia collapsed almost completely.
“For the second consecutive month no gold at all was shipped to China; a mere 1 kilogram went to Hong Kong and 500 kilograms to India. This confirms what the Indian gold import figures and the bilateral gold trading data between China and Hong Kong had already indicated: gold demand has ground to a halt in China and India, traditionally the most important countries in terms of gold demand,” he said.
Still, “the new ‘Cold War’ between China and the U.S. will also likely drive a lot of demand for gold as tensions will remain in place leading all the way up to the presidential election,” Oanda’s  Moya said in a market commentary. “Permanent damage to the economy will likely settle in over the next couple months and gold will see steady flows as unbalanced recovery takes form.”
