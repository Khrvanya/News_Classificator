Gold futures fell sharply Thursday, settling at a nearly two-week low under $1,600 an ounce, as a selloff in the stock market sent traders scrambling to sell positions in the precious metal in a bid for cash.
Traders are selling “what they can amid [in a] panicked marketplace,” said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, in daily note. Market liquidity “in a panicky global marketplace is drying up as traders and investors back away from trading markets. ‘When in doubt, get out’ is the mantra today.”
Gold for April delivery US:GCJ20 on Comex fell by $52, or 3.2%, to settle at $1,590.30 an ounce, extending its decline to a third straight session. That was the lowest most-active contract settlement since Feb. 28, according to FactSet data.
May silver US:SIK20 lost 77.1 cents, or 4.6%, to $16.005 an ounce, for the lowest most-active contract finish since July of last year.
Prices for gold, however, finished off the session’s intraday low $1,560.40, with prices staging a turn around the Federal Reserve stepped in with an immediate liquidity injection, said Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc.
The New York Fed Thursday afternoon announced measures to address “highly unusual” disruptions in Treasurys markets.
Still, investors were liquidating “any and all positions in every asset class,” on Thursday, said Wright. The market is waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week and wondering what actions Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will “take to stem the tide.”
Wright believes gold will “tread” around $1,600 an ounce, and “while safe haven buying is not happening, safe haven stability is there compared to other asset classes.”
