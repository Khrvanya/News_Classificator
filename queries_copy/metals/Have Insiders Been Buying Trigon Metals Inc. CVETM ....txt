Have Insiders Been Buying Trigon Metals Inc. (CVE:TM) Shares This Year?
It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. The flip side of that is that there are more than a few examples of insiders dumping stock prior to a period of weak performance. So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Trigon Metals Inc. ( CVE:TM ).
It's quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.
Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing. But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. For example, a Columbia University study found that 'insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own companyâ€™s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers'.
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by insider Eric Sprott for CA$2.0m worth of shares, at about CA$0.12 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of CA$0.14 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Trigon Metals insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.
