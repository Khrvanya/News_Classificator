Gold prices ended the first half of 2020 at their highest level since Sept. 21, 2011
Precious metals prices advanced Tuesday, the last trading session in June and the second quarter. Gold was not the biggest winner on the day but it easily led metals for the month. More notably, it topped $1,800 an ounce and posted its best close in nearly 9 years.
Gold for August delivery rose $19.30, or 1.1%, to settle at $1,800.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The settlement was the highest since Sept. 21, 2011 when gold ended at $1,808.10 an ounce.
"Gold is one of the only major asset classes to have a positive [year-to-date] return," MarketWatch quoted Jeff Klearman, portfolio manager at GraniteShares, which offers the GraniteShares Gold Trust. "The demand destruction wreaked upon the U.S. and global economies and then the resulting unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus response here and abroad is the primary driving force behind gold performance this year."
Gold prices scored gains of 2.8% in June, 12.8% for the quarter, and 18.2% through the first half of 2020.
Meanwhile, silver for September delivery surged 57.3 cents, or 3.2%, to close at $18.637 an ounce. The finish was the strongest since June 1 when silver settled at $18.827 an ounce. Silver futures marked increases of 0.8% in June, 31.7% for the quarter, and 4% for the year to date.
