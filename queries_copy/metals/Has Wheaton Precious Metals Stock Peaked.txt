Despite a 58% rise in Wheaton Precious Metals’ stock (NYSE: WPM) from its March lows of this year, at the current market price of $38, we believe WPM has already reached its near term potential. WPM’s stock has rallied from $24 as on 18th March to $38 on 11th June 2020, a rise of 58% as against S&P 500 which increased 25% during this period. The stock was able to beat the broader market due to a sharp rise in gold prices during the current pandemic, which benefited WPM as over 60% of its revenue comes from gold. The stock is almost 80% higher than the levels seen in the beginning of 2018, a little over two years ago. Though the current stock price is also 27% over the level at the beginning of this year, we believe that WPM’s stock has peaked for now and is likely to remain around its current level as the world still awaits the sign of abatement of the pandemic. Our dashboard What Factors Drove 90% Change In Wheaton Precious Metals Stock Between 2017 And Now? provides the key numbers behind our thinking, and we explain more below.
Some of the rise in stock price in the last 2 years is to a certain extent justified by a 2.2% increase in WPM’s revenues between 2017 and 2019. But this was offset by almost 9% decline in net income as margins dropped from 32.8% in 2017 to 29.3% in 2019. Lower margins reflected higher exploration costs per ton. On a per share basis, earnings declined 11% from $0.63 in 2017 to $0.56 in 2019, as shares outstanding increased marginally by 1% during this period.
But what actually explains the rise in stock price is the increase in the company’s P/E multiple from 34x in 2017 to 53x in 2019. This is mainly due to sharp rise in gold prices and with the company diversifying by starting palladium mining in 2018. Though the multiple went up in 2020 and currently stands at 68x, given the volatility of the current situation, there is a slight downside for WPM’s P/E multiple when compared to the levels seen in the past years.
