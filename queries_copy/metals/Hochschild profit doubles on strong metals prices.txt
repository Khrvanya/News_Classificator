Hochschild Mining PLC on Wednesday posted a significantly higher profit for 2019 driven by good cost control and improved precious metals prices which offset lower production.
Pretax profit from continuing operations doubled over 2019 to $76.8 million from $38.4 million in 2018, the precious-metals miner said.
Improved gold and silver prices pushed revenue up 7.3% to $755.7 million despite production falling 5.2% due to maintenances at the Arcata mine in Peru.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization--one of the companyÂ´s preferred metrics which strips out one-off items, such as some exploration expenses--jumped 28% to $343.3 million.
"Improved precious metals prices in the second half of the year combined with strong free cash flow generation saw us reduce leverage further and finish the year with net debt at $33 million," Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Bustamante said.
Hochschild has proposed a final dividend of 2.335 cents a share up 19% from a year earlier.
As for this year, the company expects production to fall to around 422,000 gold equivalent ounces from 2019's 477,400 ounces.
