Gold futures dropped Friday, to post a loss of nearly 4% for the week, as an unexpected monthly rise in U.S. jobs and a drop in the nation’s unemployment rate rallied the stock market, pushing prices for the haven metal to their lowest finish in two months.
“When all of the major economic data and indices have been knocked down so low, even the slightest improvements are magnified,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. “The jobs report, however, was shocking and didn’t need the magnification. Thus, the sell off today in gold and silver.”
Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a loss of 7.25 million jobs. The unemployment rate was forecast to rise to 19% from a post World War Two record of 14.7% in April, though states have been allowing businesses to reopen as the coronavirus pandemic recedes.
“The U.S. unemployment rate has shocked everyone because the number was much lower than the market expectation, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in emailed commentary. “This a mind-blowing number and shows that the economy is improving.”
