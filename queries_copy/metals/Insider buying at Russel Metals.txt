As we move through the coronavirus pandemic, if government-led inflation emerges, some dividend payers may be better suited than others. INK Canadian Insider Index member Russel Metals Inc. (Fridayâ€™s close $14.84) could potentially thrive in an inflationary environment if it can piggyback on rising steel product prices. The stock has a juicy yield of about 10 per cent, and since March 1, five insiders have spent in total just less than $1.5-million buying stock in the public market. The biggest buyer was chief executive officer John Reid who bought 30,600 shares on March 16 between $14.10 and $14.51.
