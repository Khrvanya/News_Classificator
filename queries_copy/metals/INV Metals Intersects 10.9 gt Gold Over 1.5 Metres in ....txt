* Note: Widths are drill indicated core length. An estimate of the true width of each main vein is given in the text, but some intercepts are outside of the main vein. Average grades are calculated with un-capped gold assays, as insufficient drilling has been completed to determine capping levels for higher grade gold intercepts. Reported widths include all assays of 1 g/t Au or greater. Average widths are calculated using a 1 g/t gold cut-off grade with ≤ 2 m of internal dilution of lower grade.
The reported results represent the preliminary results of the first ten holes of an initial 12-hole program at Tierras Coloradas, see Table 1 above. The program consisted of two holes drilled from each of six platforms, designed to intercept the vein at approximately 50 m and 100 m below surface (see Figure 1). Ten holes tested the Aparecida vein at different elevations and two holes tested the Quemada vein. Approximately 1,000 metres of strike length of the Aparecida vein was drill-tested. All holes were inclined to intercept the vein in the most perpendicular angle possible.
The first four drill holes tested the high-grade displacement zone of the Aparecida vein which was described in detail in INV Metals’ press release dated August 13, 2018 (see Figure 2). This zone is located near the top of the hill and includes the upper portion of the system. Holes TCD-001 and TCD-002 intercepted the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.010 to 240.5 g/t Au and 0.3 to 181.5 g/t Ag up to five metres away on each side of the hole location. A total of seven rock chip samples were collected in the veins at this location and these seven samples average 43.83 g/t Au and 48.0 g/t Ag. Holes TCD-003 and TCD-004 intercepted the displacement zone approximately 30 m to the west of the first two holes. These holes cut the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.594 to 100.7 g/t Au and 19.1 to 99.3 g/t Ag up to five metres away on each side of the hole location. A total of five rock chip samples were collected in veins at this location and these five samples average 31.22 g/t Au and 42.0 g/t Ag.
The next four holes were drilled in the middle portion of the hill in two locations on the Aparecida vein that contain strong and continuous mineralization. Holes TCD-005 and TCD-006 intercepted the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.034 to 13.1 g/t Au and 0.4 to 76.2 g/t Ag up to five meters away on each side of the proposed hole location. A total of seven rock chip samples were collected in veins at this location and these seven samples average 3.69 g/t Au and 22.4 g/t Ag. Holes TCD-007 and TCD-008 were drilled approximately 40 meters to the east. These holes intercepted the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.032 to 8.215 g/t Au and 1.1 to 10.2 g/t Ag up to five meters away on each side of the proposed hole location. A total of nine rock chip samples were collected in veins at this location and these nine samples average 1.88 g/t Au and 5.1 g/t Ag.
The next two holes were drilled on the Quemada vein. Holes TCD-009 and TCD-010 intercepted the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.264 to 61.9 g/t Au and 11.4 to 199.3 g/t Ag up to five meters away on each side of the proposed hole location. A total of twelve rock chip samples were collected in veins at this location and these twelve samples average 8.57 g/t Au and 45.9 g/t Ag.
The last two holes were drilled on the eastern Aparecida vein on the other side of the valley from the other holes and at the lowest elevation. Holes TCD-011 and TCD-012 intercepted the vein beneath the area where surface sampling returned values that range from 0.041 to 10.2 g/t Au and 1.9 to 70 g/t Ag. A total of ten rock chip samples were collected in veins at this location and these ten samples average 1.37 g/t Au and 20.8 g/t Ag. Both holes intercepted the quartz vein at depth and assays are pending for these two holes.
In general, the main quartz veins contain zones of brecciation both within the veins and along the borders of the veins. Vein textures range from massive quartz to brecciated quartz to colloform banded quartz. The host rocks for the most part are andesitic crystal tuffs and andesitic lapilli tuffs. These contain chlorite and epidote alteration with areas of calcite veining outside of the vein zones. Within the vein zones, the tuff contains silicification and illite and smectite alteration.
Hole TCD-001 intercepted 1.39 g/t gold over 2.75 metres (from 99.25 m – 102.0 m) (see Table 1) within brecciation above the vein and within the main quartz vein. The hole contains weakly altered andesitic crystal tuff at the start and at the end of the hole, brecciated zones around the main vein which extend from roughly 75 to 110 m depth, and the main quartz vein (see Figure 3). The main vein in hole TCD-001 is a 2.3 m quartz vein consisting of massive white quartz with zones of brecciation and iron oxides on fractures. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 2.0 m. Two small intercepts before the main vein are related to a mineralized quartz vein and a fault zone. Results have been received for the entirety of this hole.
Hole TCD-002 intercepted 2.31 g/t Au, 7.4 g/t Ag over 11.9 m (including 3.91 g/t Au, 7.7 g/t Ag over 4.0 m) and 1.11 g/t Au, 4.8 g/t Ag over 2.0 m (see Table 1). The mineralization is related to faulting in the hanging wall of the main vein and to the main quartz vein. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 64 to 138 m depth. This interval includes the main quartz veins and the surrounding zone of alteration and brecciation. The main vein is a 3.9 m quartz vein consisting of massive white quartz with zones of crustiform banding and iron oxides on fractures. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 2.8 m. The intercepts that are before and after the main quartz vein are related to additional mineralized quartz veins.
Hole TCD-003 intercepted 2.78 g/t Au, 127.2 g/t Ag over 3.0 m (see Table 1). Mineralization is related to the main quartz vein. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 50 to 76 m depth. This interval corresponds to the zone of alteration and brecciation around the main vein and the main vein itself. The main vein is a 3.85 m quartz vein consisting of massive white quartz with extensive brecciation and iron oxides on fractures (see Figure 4). True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 2.8 m.
Hole TCD-004 intercepted 10.94 g/t Au, 36.3 g/t Ag over 1.5 m and 3.31 g/t Au, 7.5 g/t Ag over 1.8 m (see Table 1). All three intercepts in this hole are related to mineralized quartz veins. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 89 to 110 m. This interval corresponds to the quartz veins and the surrounding zone of alteration and brecciation. The main vein is a 3.5 m quartz vein consisting of white to grey quartz with minor brecciation and iron oxides on fractures. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 1.9 m.
Hole TCD-005 was drilled in the middle portion of the hill in an area of strong and continuous mineralization (see Figure 5) but did not have any intercepts of >1 g/t Au. The main vein and the zone of alteration around the main vein are both weakly anomalous in gold. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 49 to 82 m depth. This interval corresponds to the zone of alteration and brecciation around the main vein and the main vein itself. The main vein is a 2.1 m quartz vein consisting of white quartz with minor colloform banding (see Figure 6). True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 1.5 m.
Hole TCD-006 intercepted 1.37 g/t Au, 1.7 g/t Ag over 1.0 m (see Table 1). The intercept is related to brecciation in the footwall of the main vein. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 86 to 119 m depth. This interval corresponds to the zone of alteration and brecciation around the main vein and the main vein itself. The main vein is an 8.2 m quartz vein consisting of massive white quartz with minor colloform banding. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 3.7 m.
Hole TCD-007 intercepted 2.02 g/t Au, 5.2 g/t Ag over 0.8 m and 1.22 g/t Au, 4.3 g/t Ag over 0.85 m (see Table 1). Results have been received for the entirety of this hole. The mineralization is related to the main quartz vein and smaller mineralized quartz veins nearby (see Figure 7). The main vein is a 1.0 m quartz vein consisting of white to grey quartz with minor colloform banding. Several smaller veins before the main vein display colloform banding. True width of the main vein in this hole is estimated to be 0.7 m. All three intercepts in this hole are related to mineralized quartz veins.
Hole TCD-008 did not have any intercepts of >1 g/t Au. The main vein and the zone of alteration around the main vein are both weakly anomalous in gold. Results have been received for the entirety of this hole. The main vein is a 1.5 m quartz vein consisting of white quartz with weak colloform banding. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 0.7 m.
Drill holes TCD-009 and TCD-010 are the only holes that were drilled on the Quemada vein (see Figure 8). Hole TCD-009 intercepted 1.96 g/t Au, 3.6 g/t Ag over 2.1 m and 1.41 g/t Au, 5.5 g/t Ag over 0.7 m (see Table 1). Results have been received for the entirety of this hole. The 2.1 m intercept is related to a small vein located around 25 m to the southwest of the Quemada vein that contains white quartz with weak colloform banding (see Figure 9). The 0.7 m intercept is related to the Quemada vein. The main vein is a 0.79 m quartz vein consisting of brecciated white to grey quartz. True width of the main vein in this hole is estimated to be 0.7 m.
Hole TCD-010 intercepted 1.73 g/t Au, 8.2 g/t Ag over 2.0 m (see Table 1). The intercept is related to a small vein located around 25 m to the southwest of the Quemada vein that contains white quartz with weak colloform banding. Only partial results are available from this hole and include the interval from 0 to 67 m depth. This interval corresponds to the zone of alteration and brecciation around the main vein and the main vein itself. The main vein is a 2.4 m quartz vein consisting of white brecciated quartz with moderate to strong colloform banding. True width of the vein in this hole is estimated to be 1.6 m.
Systematic spectral analysis of the core is planned using a Terraspec spectrometer. The data aids in the identification of temperature gradients based on the minerals present within the veins and within their corresponding alteration envelopes. Combining the data with the systematic geochemical data may aid with vectoring towards areas of possible higher grade mineralization and also to identify areas with potential for additional unrecognized mineralized veins.
