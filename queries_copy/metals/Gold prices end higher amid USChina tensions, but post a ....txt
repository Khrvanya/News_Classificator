China moved to impose new national-security laws on Hong Kong. The proposed laws would challenge the semiautonomous country’s governance and appeared to draw a swift rebuke from the U.S.
The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported that U.S. senators were introducing a bipartisan bill that would sanction Chinese officials and entities who enforce the new Hong Kong laws, and penalize banks that do business with the entities.
With the crisis in Hong Kong picking up, stock markets in Asia and the U.S. declined , resulting in “safe haven buying for both gold and silver,” said James Hatzigiannis, chief market strategist at Ploutus Capital Advisors.
The “U.S. has threatened a very harsh retaliation if China challenges Hong Kong’s autonomy, which then could lead to U.S. implementing more tariffs,” he told MarketWatch. Those tensions aren’t likely to influence gold for long as the market tends to overreact once news hits, but Hatzigiannis said he expects gold prices to go up regardless of that.
