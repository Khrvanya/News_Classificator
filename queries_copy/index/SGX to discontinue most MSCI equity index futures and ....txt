THE Singapore Exchange (SGX) will discontinue its MSCI equity index futures and options contracts, save for those under MSCI Singapore, when their licence agreements expire in February next year, the bourse operator said in a filing on Wednesday.
It will, however, keep its partnership with New York-based global index publisher MSCI on MSCI Singapore Index products, with both parties working to extend the partnership "well beyond 2021".
SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye said the bourse operator will work closely with relevant stakeholders to manage their open interest as it "gradually discontinues" the bulk of its MSCI equity index futures and options contracts.
While the move could have a near-term impact on SGX's equities derivatives open interest, its multi-asset portfolio shelf has reached "a critical mass", he added.
