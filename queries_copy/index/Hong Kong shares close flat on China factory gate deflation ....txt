Hong Kong shares close flat on China factory gate deflation; Fed in focus
BEIJING, June 10 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares closed little changed on Wednesday as risk sentiment was hit by a deepened deflation in China’s producer prices, and investors waited for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s economic projections.
** At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down 7.49 points, or 0.03%, at 25,049.73.

** U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday will publish their first economic projections since the coronavirus pandemic set off a recession in February, estimates expected to signal a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was firmer by 0.47%, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed up 0.15%. ** The yuan was quoted at 7.0715 per U.S. dollar at 08:08 GMT, 0.07% firmer than the previous close of 7.0765.
