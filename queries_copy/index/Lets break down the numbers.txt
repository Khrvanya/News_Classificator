“Let’s do the numbers.” Music — to some degree of cheerful or dreadful — plays in the background as our host reads off a list of companies and financial statistics. We hear about the S&P 500, the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq, and what percentage they were up or down. We’re getting an update on the stock market — which is not the economy .
In its most basic sense, a stock market, or exchange, is a place where shares of publicly traded companies are sold and bought. Companies can be listed on stock exchanges in a few ways, but an initial public offering is t he most common to join public markets. William Michael Cunningham, an investment adviser and CEO of Creative Investment Research, said that companies trade on public markets because it increases access to both buyers and sellers.
There are about 60 major stock exchanges across the world, with approximately 630,000 companies traded on those exchanges. Of those exchanges, the largest remains the New York Stock Exchange, which now has exchanges in both the United States and Europe.
“We recognize the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq as being stock markets, but when we refer generically to the U.S. stock market, we really mean the markets for all stocks — wherever they trade,” said Lawrence Harris, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California. He added that there are systems to ensure that the price of one company’s stock is generally the same across all markets on which it’s traded.
