Commenting on the period 20.06.2020 – 26.06.2020, BriefYourMarket.com’s Chief Commercial Officer, Richard Combellack, said:
“Another week on and the market continues to look healthy.
“The fall-through rate continues to remain steady, settling in and around the 5,000 mark for the third week running.
“Another positive is that withdrawals are continuing to reduce significantly on a weekly basis.
“New properties coming to market – after the surge of the previous week (65,977) – still looks strong, standing at 60,149.
“The best news from last week is that sales (SSTC) have improved, climbing from 29,434 to 34,915 in total.
“So, although new properties coming to market has seen a slight fall last week, there is still plenty of optimism in how the market is performing.
“Last week’s trend analysis would certainly indicate that vendors are continuing to gain confidence in the new process of putting their house on the market, and are happy to work under the new conditions that are rapidly becoming the new normal for the industry.
“This optimism is having a positive knock-on effect on the number of withdrawals and the number of new instructions coming to market, as new properties coming to market have remained in and around the 60,000 mark for the last two weeks now.
