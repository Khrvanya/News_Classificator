"The world's financial system has become dislocated," Kim Mundy, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. "Underlying the big moves is a lack of confidence governments have the right plan to contain the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus."
Government bureaucracy simply has not kept pace with the nature of the outbreak and market expectations.
"While investors are looking for immediate remedies from governments and central banks, the virus spread has far outpaced the typical reaction time by governments in devising new policies to deal with a largely unprecedented economic and sociacl event," J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Tai Hui wrote in a note. "Government bureaucracy simply has not kept pace with the nature of the outbreak and market expectations."
"Investors may be asking, is it time to get back into stocks? Market sentiment will remain jittery in the near term as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to accelerate in the US and Europe," said Tai, who is chief Asia market strategist. "As we have experienced in China and other parts of Asia, the right policies to contain the outbreak should work but this involves some sharp, short term pain. We are likely to go through such pain in the weeks ahead in the US and Europe."
