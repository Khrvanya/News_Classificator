The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday pegged global corn stocks at 337.9 million metric tons at the end of the 2020-2021 marketing year.

Domestic stockpiles were seen at 3.32 billion bushels, a jump from the previous year’s 2.1 billion bushels.
Global soybean inventories, meanwhile, are forecast at 96.3 million metric tons at the end of the 2020-2021 marketing year, little changed from the previous month’s forecast and down slightly from the year-earlier 99.2 million metric tons.
U.S. stocks are pegged at 395 million bushels, down from 405 million forecast a month ago and 585 million at the end of the previous marketing year.
