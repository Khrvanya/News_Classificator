Corn, Soybeans Higher Overnight; Weekly Export Sales Decline Across the Board.
Corn and soybean futures were higher in overnight trading on optimism about a plan from the White House to slowly reopen the economy despite the number of cases in the U.S. topping 662,000.
Projections expected today from the White House likely will show the number of cases growing at a slower pace as social distancing restrictions remain in place and the majority of Americans stay home to prevent the disease’s spread.
President Donald Trump on Thursday presented a three-stage approach to revive the economy in which states would need to show a declining number of cases for 14 days before proceeding.
The president said to reporters that the country will not open at once, and states must restart “one careful step at a time.” He said earlier in April that the country would reopen with a “big bang,” according to Reuters.
The number of cases in the U.S. is now at 662,045 and the death toll is up to almost 29,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Corn futures for May delivery rose 2¾¢ to $3.22½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybean futures for May delivery rose 3½¢ to $8.49¼ a bushel overnight, while soy meal added $1.20 to $297.30 a short ton, and soy oil gained 0.12¢ to 26.80¢ a pound.
Wheat futures for May delivery fell 3¢ to $5.27½ a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and Kansas City futures declined 1¢ to $4.75¾ a bushel.
