Corn, Soybeans Higher Overnight; Ethanol Production Falls to Six-Year Low.
Corn and soybean futures were slightly higher in overnight trading, while wheat futures declined.
The bounce in corn and beans comes after yesterday’s declines, indicating some of the buying may be bargain hunters seeking supplies.
Commodity Risk Management Group’s Britt O’Connell said yesterday that he was impressed at how well corn held up after the USDA said in a report it expected producers to plant 97 million acres with the grain this year, topping forecasts.
Soybeans may be seeing some support this morning after the USDA forecast area at 83.5 million acres, missing expectations.

2. Ethanol Production Drops to Lowest Level Since 2013, While Stockpiles Hit Record High
Ethanol production plunged to the lowest level in more than six years last week, while stockpiles surged to a record high, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Output of the biofuel made from corn dropped to an average of 840,000 barrels a day in the week that ended on March 27, the EIA said in a report.
That’s down from an average of 1.005 million barrels a day seven days earlier and the lowest output since September 2013, government data show.
Declining fuel demand due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the production decline.
In the Midwest, by far the largest-producing region, output was reported at 778,000 barrels a day, on average, down from 934,000 barrels a day the previous week. That was also the lowest average since September 2013.
Production on the East Coast dropped to an average of 20,000 barrels a day from 25,000 barrels, Rocky Mountain output fell to 11,000 barrels from 14,000, and West Coast production declined to 10,000 barrels from 13,000 barrels a day last week.
The Gulf Coast saw the week’s only gains, rising to 21,000 barrels a day, on average, from 19,000 a week earlier, the agency said.
Stockpiles, meanwhile, increased to 25.717 million barrels in the seven days that ended on March 27. That’s up from 24.14 million barrels the previous week and the highest ever, according to the EIA.
3. Winter Weather Hitting the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Parts of Iowa and Minnesota
Major storms are slamming the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest today as winter storm warnings are in effect for a wide chunk of land in North Dakota, South Dakota, and western Minnesota, according to the National Weather Service.
In eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, up to 5 inches of snow are expected along with ice accumulations, the NWS said in a report early this morning.
Five inches of snow also are expected to fall in parts of western and north-central South Dakota today.
“Areas of heavy snow will move out of the region early this morning, with periods of mostly light snow expected for today,” the NWS said. “Gusty northwesterly winds will produce some blowing and drifting snow, especially across the western South Dakota plains.”
Travel is expected to be very difficult.
A winter weather advisory is in effect for much of Nebraska, southern South Dakota, and northwestern Iowa.
In Nebraska, mixed precipitation is forecast with less than ½ inch of snow expected, though some ice will accumulate, the NWS said.
