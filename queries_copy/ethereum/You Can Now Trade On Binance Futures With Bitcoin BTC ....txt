Binance Futures has added Bitcoin as an option to be used as cross collateral. Traders are now able to leverage their BTC held on the Exchange wallet to borrow Tether (USDT) on the Futures platform.
The Futures platform of the leading cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, announced earlier today on adding a cross collateral function for Bitcoin, in addition to Tether (USDT). By this move, the Binance Futures platform adjusts itself to a broader market and joins its biggest competitors, such as BitMEX, that offer Bitcoin cross collateral.
The “Cross Collateral” option appears in the Binance Futures wallet interface. Once the users have determined how much USDT they would like to borrow, they can initiate the “start borrowing” process. The users will receive the Tether (USDT) in their Futures wallet, while the collateral amount of Bitcoin will be deducted from the spot wallet.

Similarly, when the traders are satisfied with their position, they can repay the loan from the “collateral” menu in their Futures Wallet. According to Binance guidelines, 1 USDT is the minimum amount to borrow, while the maximum is 1,000,000 per account.
