For the past  few weeks, TRX has been the main focus of keen traders and investors who trade altcoins based on major events. In this case, the Great Voyage live conference will be held on the 7th of July and it will usher in the new era of Tron 4.0
As can be seen by the roadmap above, TRX might be worth hodling even after the live event on the 7th. To get a better picture of the potential of Tron in the crypto markets, the daily TRX/USDT can provide adequate clues.
From the 1-day TRX/USDT chart, the following can be observed.
Trade volume is in the green, with all moving averages setting up for a bullish few days for TRX in the crypto markets.
MACD has also crossed in a bullish manner across the baseline with the daily MFI yet to be exhausted at a value of 64.
$0.0177 and $0.01864 provide short term resistance zones for TRX in the coming days.
At the time of writing this, TRX is valued at $0.0169.
It is with this brief technical analysis that it can be concluded that $0.0177 is the short term resistance level to watch for TRX with the Great Voyage event less than 5 days away.
However, the 2020 and 2021 roadmap of TRON 4.0, points to more reasons to be bullish on TRX at least until mid-2021. If Bitcoin provides stable crypto market conditions, TRX/USDT could retest, or even eclipse its February 2020 high of $0.0269 by the time Tron 4.0 is fully implemented.
As with all analyses of Tron, traders and investors are advised to use risk management techniques such as stop losses and to practise using low leverage during uncertain times.
