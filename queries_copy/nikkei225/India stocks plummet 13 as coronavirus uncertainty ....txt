The global coronavirus outbreak continues to spread rapidly across the world, with the number of infected now over 294,000 and more than 12,900 lives taken, according to data from the World Health Organization.
"It's fair to say that Asian markets will continue to trade off negative sentiment coming out of Europe and the U.S.," James Sullivan, head of Asia ex-Japan equity research at J.P. Morgan, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. Still, he added: "We would be selectively adding to exposure here."
Sullivan outlined two "key components to a buy case in trying to find a bottom in markets" at present. Firstly, he highlighted "aggressive fiscal implementation" by governments around the region, citing efforts in Hong Kong as well as Australia.
"The other is a market structure conversation," Sullivan said. "You saw significant liquidity impacts across global markets as we've worked our way through this crisis, we do see this as one of the sharpest, but also on our numbers at least, one of the shortest global downturns that we've seen in the history of markets."
