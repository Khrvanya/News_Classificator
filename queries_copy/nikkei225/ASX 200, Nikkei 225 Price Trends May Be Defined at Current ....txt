ASX 200, NIKKEI 225 Technical ANALYSIS – TALKING POINTS:
Coronavirus outbreak fears delivered the worst week since September 2008 – the heart of the global financial crisis – for Australia’s benchmark ASX 200 stock index. It plunged from a record high to erase six months of gains in just five days, landing at support-turned-resistance in the 6358-96 area.
Breaking below that initially exposes an inflection level at 6150, with the psychologically significant 6000 handle eyed thereafter. These are relatively minor barriers however. Prices have stalled in their vicinity before, but they have not shown a capacity to force lasting directional change.
This suggests that sellers may have scope to challenge structural support establishing the 11-year post-crisis recovery if current support has been conclusively overcome. Confirmation on that score will probably have to be secured on a closing basis to make for a compelling setup.
