The Nikkei continues north for eighth consecutive trading session enhancing the recent bullish momentum and reaching the upside target for the index that we mentioned in our Nikkei technical analysis article yestarday. On the upside resistance for the Nikkei 225 stands at 21,825 today’s high, a break above, perhaps will set the stage for a move up to 22,180 the high from May 7th. On the downside immediate support stands at 21,744, today’s low and then at 21,229 the 100-day moving average.
