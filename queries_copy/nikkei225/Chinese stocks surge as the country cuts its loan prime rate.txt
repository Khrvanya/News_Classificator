Stocks in Australia saw gains as the S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.25% to close at 7,162.50. The moves came as an earlier release showed Australia's unemployment rate rising on a seasonally adjusted basis in January. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in January rising to 5.3% from a reading of 5.1% in December.
Following that release, the Australian dollar changed hands at $0.6642 after seeing an earlier high of $0.6696.
"While the fall in the unemployment rate to 5.1% in December gave the ( Reserve Bank of Australia ) the signal that another interest rate cut was not necessary at its February meeting, today's data confuses the interest rate debate because the RBA's latest forecasts assume the unemployment rate will average 5.2% for now," Diana Mousina, senior economist at AMP Capital, wrote in a note.
"In our view, the higher than expected lift in the unemployment rate on its own is unlikely to push the RBA to cut at its March meeting as the central bank would want to see if the increase in the unemployment rate will be repeated in next month's employment figures," Mousina said, though she warned the chance of a rate cut in March is high at around 40-50%.
