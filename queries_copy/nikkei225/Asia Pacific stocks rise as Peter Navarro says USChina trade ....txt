It rose as high as 498.60 Hong Kong dollars per share before finishing the trading day 4.89% higher.
Mainland Chinese stocks were higher on the day, with the Shanghai composite up 0.18% to around 2,970.62 while the Shenzhen component rose 0.782% to about 11,794.01.

Fox's Martha MacCallum asked, "Do you think that the president sort of- I mean, he obviously really wanted to hang onto this trade deal as much as possible. And he wanted them to make good on the promises, because there had been progress made on that trade deal, but given everything that's happened and all the things you just listed, is that over?"
In a statement to CNBC following the interview, Navarro said his comments were "taken wildly out of context."
"I was simply speaking to the lack of trust we now have of the Chinese Communist Party after they lied about the origins of the China virus and foisted a pandemic upon the world," Navarro said.
U.S. President Donald Trump also chimed in on the subject, saying in a tweet that the "China Trade Deal is fully intact."
Meanwhile, concerns around the coronavirus situation stateside also likely lingered. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned Monday that " additional measures are going to be necessary " if coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continued spiking. That came as the states of Nevada, Florida, California and Arizona recently reported record-high single-day infections.
"Investors remain focused on the states re opening strategies with monitors such as restaurant diners tracked by OpenTable and mobility track(ed) by Apple all pointing to an increase in US economic activity," Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note.
"Investors continue to see a high bar for the re-introduction of containment measures," Catril said, highlighting White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow's comments to CNBC on Monday that a " second wave " of coronavirus cases isn't coming.
