"They're certainly pulling out all the stops, this is absolutely above the high end of our expectations," J.P. Morgan's James Sullivan said, commenting on the Hong Kong budget. Still, he added that it will be some time before a recovery takes place in the city.

Morgan, told CNBC's "Street Signs" on Wednesday.
"I don't think one budget will be enough to move the needle on the structural issues that the economy is facing but clearly from a short-term perspective it's a lot of incremental liquidity into the marketplace," he said.
