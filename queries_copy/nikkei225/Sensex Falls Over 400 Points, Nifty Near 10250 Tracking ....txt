Sensex Falls Over 400 Points, Nifty Near 10,250 Tracking Global Markets
Shares elsewhere in Asia began the week with caution as the relentless spread of the coronavirus made investors question their optimism on the global economy.
Domestic stock markets started the week on a negative note tracking weakness in Asian equities, as rising COVID-19 cases dashed hopes of a recovery across the globe. The S&P BSE Sensex index dropped as much as 1.27 per cent - or 448.06 points - to 34,723.21 in early trade, having started the session down 244.32 points (0.69 per cent) at 34,926.95. The broader NSE Nifty 50 benchmark declined to as low as 10,249.30 after starting the day with a gap-down opening at 10,311.95 compared to its previous close of 10,383.00. Losses in banking, financial services and metal stocks dragged the markets lower, however gains in consumer goods and pharmaceutical shares arrested the fall.
At 9:44 am, the Sensex traded 394.13 points - or 1.12 per cent - lower at 34,777.14, while the Nifty was at 10,289.85, down 93.15 points - or 0.90 per cent - from its previous close.
In the 50-scrip Nifty index, 38 stocks moved lower at the time. Top percentage losers were Bajaj Finance, Axis Bank, Coal India, Hincaldo and Bharti Infratel, trading between 2.88 per cent and 4.27 per cent lower.
ITC, Cipla, Nestle, Sun Pharma and Britannia, trading between 0.64 per cent and 2.69 per cent higher, were the top Nifty gainers.
Reliance Industries (down 1.23 per cent), HDFC Bank (1.29 per cent) and HDFC (1.99 per cent) were the top drags on Sensex, together accounting for a decline of more than 150 points in the index.
Shares in Mumbai-based Piramal Enterprises rose as much as 1.54 per cent to Rs 1,363.25 apiece on the BSE, after the conglomerate said US-based investment firm Carlyle Group will purchase a 20 per cent stake in its pharmaceutical unit for around $490 million (Rs 3,706.36 crore at one rupee = $75.64).
