Meanwhile, Apple suppliers in Asia fell sharply in the morning, as the tech giant warned it may not meet its quarterly revenue forecast because of lower iPhone supply globally and lower Chinese demand as a result of disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak.
Apple makes most of its iPhones and products in China. The epidemic has caused the company to temporarily halt production and close retail stores in China. Some Apple retail stores reopened in China with reduced schedules last week.
Over in Taiwan, Hon Hai Precision Industry , Apple's largest supplier, declined almost 1% before settling down 0.60%.
"This unexpected news confirms the worst fears of the Street that the virus outbreak has dramatically impacted iPhone supply from China/Foxconn with a demand ripple impact worldwide," Wedbush Securities analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe wrote in a note, adding that the magnitude of the impact is "clearly worse than feared."
"While this news is a tough pill to swallow for the bulls, Apple remains a company significantly exposed to this virus issue given the company's massive supply and demand tentacles throughout China," they added.
The outbreak, which started in China but has since spread globally, is set to impact other companies too. In fact, it could hit as many as five million companies worldwide , a new study showed. Almost half (49%) of the companies with subsidiaries in impacted regions are headquartered in Hong Kong, while the U.S. accounts for 19%, Japan 12% and Germany 5%.
The impact on businesses in China and around the world has dragged down economic growth forecasts for the year.
"Focus is now shifting to the likely economic impact of COVID-19. With data sparse it is very hard to tell, though daily pollution levels are easily available and we note the cumulative pollution for the year is around 20-25% lower than this time last year," Tapas Strickland, director of economics and markets at the National Australia Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday. "Overall that suggests a substantial decline in industrial activity in Q1."
Singapore, one of the worst hit by the outbreak outside China, is set to unveil its budget on Tuesday . The Southeast Asian nation is expected to spend big, to soften the economic blow from the outbreak which has hit companies and tourism.
