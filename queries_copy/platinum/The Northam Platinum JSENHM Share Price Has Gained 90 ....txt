It hasn’t been the best quarter for Northam Platinum Limited ( JSE:NHM ) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 20% in that time. On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 90% in that time.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company’s share price and its earnings per share (EPS).
During the five years of share price growth, Northam Platinum moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we’d expect the share price to be up.
It is of course excellent to see how Northam Platinum has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling Northam Platinum stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet .
