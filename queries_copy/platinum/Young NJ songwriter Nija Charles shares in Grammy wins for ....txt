Later, during the televised part of the Grammys, Charles celebrated a win for best rap album for Cardi B, who performed during the show and made history by becoming the first female solo artist to win the award.
Charles co-wrote the hooks on two songs for “ Invasion of Privacy ,” the rapper’s debut album: “ I Do ,” featuring Maplewood’s own SZA , and “ Ring ,” featuring Kehlani. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in April, and “Ring” went platinum.
Artists who have met and worked with Charles congratulated her on the Grammy victories.
“I’m....a Grammy Award Winning Songwriter?” Charles tweeted after learning of her first win.
“ABSOLUTELY ARE,” replied Kehlani, 23, who was nominated for Grammys in 2016 and 2018.

Singer Elle Varner, who was nominated for two Grammys in 2013 and shared in the best rap album Grammy for Chance the Rapper’s album “Coloring Book” in 2017, remembered meeting Charles when she was a student at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, where Varner served as a mentor. (Charles attended a Future Music Moguls program there for high schoolers and later returned for college at NYU.) The singer tweeted a group photo she took with the future Grammy winner from that time.
Charles, who first got the attention of producers on Instagram when she tried to get attention for her own production by singing over her beats, ended up leaving college to move to the West Coast and work as a songwriter full-time. Producers like Diplo were already flying her out for recording sessions while she was still in college.
In a December interview with NJ Advance Media, when she was home for the holidays, Charles reflected on her success.
“It’s kind of mind-blowing, because the artists that inspire me, I’m helping them now ,” she said.
Wow so I do a summer mentoring program at @CliveDavisInst #NYU and my girl @amnija_ is now a #Grammy winner! 😍🙏🏽🙌🏽✍🏽 that’s her right next to me ❤️💫 Thank you @maratberenstein for your great work and this opportunity! pic.twitter.com/vTC8giQxhK
