Not including games that are broken or require online play but nobody is playing them, Crypt of the Necrodancer is perhaps the closest-to-impossible Platinum Trophy ever crafted by mortal hands. As it stands, Trophy tracking website psnprofiles.com lists a mere 11 users as having bonked the Platinum gong on this one, with a trophy rarity of 0.06%.
So, what makes this Trophy list PlayStation 4's very own Mount Everest? Well, it's a notoriously difficult rhythm-based roguelike to start with, but in order to unlock all of the Trophies, you'll need to play the game around fifty times, including multiple runs with each character with increasingly silly restrictions. The coup de grace is the Trophy "Lowest of the Low" which tasks you with beating the game with all nine characters, back to back in one run, without dying at all and with every character still in their default gear.
Anyone who clocks the Platinum in Crypt of the Necrodancer should receive a personal visit from Shuhei Yoshida himself to present them with an actual Platinum Trophy to put on their mantlepiece next to the picture of their mum.
