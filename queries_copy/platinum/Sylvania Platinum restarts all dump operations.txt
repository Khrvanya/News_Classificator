Sylvania Platinum updated the market on the status of the Sylvania dump operations (SDO) on Monday, following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions on mining companies by the South African government.
The AIM-traded firm said the SDO restarted with scaled-down operations on 1 May, with management having “endeavoured” to ramp-up and maximise production under the strict conditions stipulated by the government and the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy.
It said all six operations were now running, although at “reduced but stable” throughput, with the operations beginning to dispatch platinum group metals concentrate during the last week.
“The teams at all the SDO sites are to be commended for their commitment and hard work in ensuring that the operations started up with minimal difficulty whilst prioritising the safety of all employees,” the board said in its statement.
“The protection, health and safety of all employees continues to be Sylvania's highest priority and will extend beyond the end of lockdown.
“The required measures are in place to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and the application of all the necessary training, health, hygiene, safety and personal protective procedures that are required to keep the group's employees safe.”
At 1511 BST, shares in Sylvania Platinum were up 6.08% at 46.25p.
