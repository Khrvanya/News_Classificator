"It's clear from solar installers' demand that our solid products and warranties make a real difference in their businesses and their customer satisfaction," said Peter Lorenz, Unirac CEO. "That's exactly why we rolled out this programâ€”to arm our trusted installation partners with training, tools and marketing assets to help grow their own businesses and continue providing excellent customer support."
Sunpro Solar has achieved the top tier certification from Unirac after being evaluated on measurable company practices and consumer confidence. All partners are vetted on how well they embody the ideals of Unirac's mission, "Better Solar Starts Here," thus helping the solar industry expand across the country. The Certified Platinum level will provide extended warranties for homeowners while providing second-to-none customer service.
"Sunpro Solar is proud to be among the first Unirac Platinum Certified Installers," said Marc Jones, Founder/CEO. "Partnering with companies that stand behind their product allows us to offer the strongest warranties in the industry."
