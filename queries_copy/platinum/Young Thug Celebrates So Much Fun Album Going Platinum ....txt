Young Thug ‘s celebrating his latest major accomplishment in a major way.
The Atlanta rapper recently received a plaque for his platinum-selling album So Much Fun after it was certified back in January. When Thug finally got the plaque, he didn’t just want a decent sized version, he decided to get a six-foot version. He shared the image to his Instagram account on Thursday (July 2).
“SO MUCH FUN,” Thug wrote.
Dubbed as his official studio debut, the 2019 album from Thug featured many of his close associates such as Gunna, 21 Savage, Future, Quavo and more. The project was buoyed by the lead singles “The London” and “Hot.” The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with 131,000 equivalent album units earned and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in June.
