Sunpro Solar is among a group of solar installers hand-selected by Unirac , a solar racking manufacturer working in the space for 20 years, as a Certified Platinum Installer .
Certified partners have the full backing of Unirac, and the platinum-tier certification in this industry-first program is designed to differentiate top installers while bringing significant benefits to homeowners.
“It’s clear from solar installers’ demand that our solid products and warranties make a real difference in their businesses and their customer satisfaction,” said Peter Lorenz, Unirac CEO. “That’s exactly why we rolled out this program — to arm our trusted installation partners with training, tools and marketing assets to help grow their own businesses and continue providing excellent customer support.”
Sunpro Solar has achieved the certification from Unirac after being evaluated on measurable company practices and consumer confidence. All partners are vetted on how well they embody the ideals of Unirac’s mission, “Better Solar Starts Here,” thus helping the solar industry expand across the country. The Certified Platinum level will provide extended warranties for homeowners.
“Sunpro Solar is proud to be among the first Unirac Platinum Certified Installers,” said Marc Jones, founder & CEO. “Partnering with companies that stand behind their product allows us to offer the strongest warranties in the industry.”
