Canadian hip-hop artist NAV hasn’t let quarantine stop him from having fun. The rap star recently linked up with Thug and premiered their new “No Debate” music video.
After some initial April 2020 teasing, Thug and R&B star Chris Brown finally hit the green light on dropping new tunes . The music duo blessed fans with their Slime & B mixtape release. The project dropped on Brown’s 31st birthday and is the latest collaboration they’ve done since 2017’s “High End” record.
On the 13-track project, Thugger and Breezy go back-to-back on the various songs, displaying some immaculate chemistry as they exchange verses. Thug continues to highlight why he’s one of trap music’s pioneers, with Brown delivering his unmistakably-sultry R&B vocals alongside. The end result is a succinct take on R&B-trap, giving fans the best of both worlds. Alongside their own performances, the two have also recruited a slew of contributions from Gunna , Lil Duke , Future , and Too $hort , with production handled by the likes of Murda Beatz , Wheezy , Turbo , and many more.
