The audits were conducted before the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.
Following a comprehensive  on-site audit, Talon Air has renewed two of the private aviation industry's  leading third-party safety ratings: Argus Platinum and IS-BAO Stage  III. The audits were conducted before the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.
According to Talon CEO James Chitty, "I am proud of our team for  successfully passing these intensive audits," adding, "safety has  always been Talon's number one priority. There is nothing more important  to us than the safety and well being of our clients and team members."
Argus and IS-BAO are recognized throughout the industry and by regulators as  key measures of an operator's dedication to safety and industry best practices,  often exceeding regulations. Auditors reviewed all aspects of Talon's  operation, including flight operations, maintenance, dispatch, charter and  safety.
In addition to the Argus and IS-BAO status, Talon is also a Wyvern Wingman  operator. Less than one percent of all charter companies worldwide have achieved  the top ratings in all three independent audit programs.
