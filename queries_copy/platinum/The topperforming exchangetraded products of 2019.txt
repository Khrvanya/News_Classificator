The five-year numbers provide some context, showing how returns from palladium have comfortably surpassed even the high-flying US stock market since 2014.
Anyone with any experience of commodity prices will however recognise that this kind of performance is unlikely to be sustained.
If there is one certain thing about commodity prices itâ€™s that they are highly cyclical.
Looking at ETPs more broadly, 2019 was generally a good year for local investors. Only seven of the 70 index-tracking products with track records longer than one year produced negative returns over the past 12 months. This is a significant improvement from last year, when 41 ETPs on the JSE were in the red.
Many ETPs tracking local equity indices were also up more than 10% for 2019. In 2018, only four funds tracking a JSE-related index delivered even a positive return.
The exceptions last year were the Satrix Property ETF, which lost 4.3% over the 12 months to the end of December, and the Absa NewFunds Value Equity ETF, which was down 2%. The other funds to experience negative returns were those tracking African equities, African property, the price of corn, and the value of the euro and the dollar against the rand.
Apart from the ETPs tracking the prices of platinum group metals, the top performers tended to be products with international exposure. As the table below shows, these were dominated by funds tracking US stock market indices, particularly those with high tech exposure.
Of the top 15 performers, the only one tracking a local index was the Absa NewFunds Equity Momentum ETF. It produced a return almost double the 12.05% of the FTSE/JSE All Share Index for the year.
