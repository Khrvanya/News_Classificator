If current leaks are any indication, Jordan Brand is ostensibly more focused on 2021 than 2020, prepared to proffer a number of brand new colorways across the entire original line-up. And, though just one of the many Air Jordan 1 s planned for the near future, the women’s exclusive “Silver Toe” is sure to be an instantly coveted pair upon its outset. Visualized via mock-up, the pair takes on a relatively classic color blocking — the toe cap dyeing black just as the swoosh, ankle, and lace unit behind it. The metallic accents, as the namesake would imply, dress much of the rest of the forefoot, adding a unique flavor in conjunction with the ankle flap and heel counter paneling. White neutrals line the profile base for a more OG-esque touch, while the Wings insignia and “NIKE AIR” branding complement in black and white respectively. Grab a speculative look at these here and expect a release to arrive hopefully early 2021.
In other news, A Lucky Green Jordan 1 is coming as well.
