First Majestic Silver is the last of our silver stocks. In 2016, AG stock showed amazing technical leadership as shares blasted higher by nearly six-fold before crashing lower with silver and most other industry players. With AG stock I’m looking for a return of price momentum in 2019’s second half.
Currently shares of AG are testing the 2017 high which is aligned with the 38% retracement level from 2016’s cycle peak. Similar to PAAS, I’m not expecting a deeper pullback pattern to emerge. It could happen, but for now I’d put this silver stock on the radar for purchase above the high formed last week.
On the upside, I’d be aware of the $12.00 area as the 50% retracement level comes into play. However, with AG stock above its 2017 peak and the decline from 2016’s high a swift price collapse, I’m anticipating resistance won’t be any trouble until approximately $13.50 and the 62% level. That’s where I’d look to take initial profits.
For AG stock to stay on the watch list as a momentum-style breakout candidate, I’d like to see shares remain above $9.25. If this silver stock falters, the entry is off the table and waiting for a much deeper and oversold pullback to form would make sense.
