Silver exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) closely track the price of silver and are generally more liquid than owning the precious metal itself. Like other precious metals, silver ETFs are favored by investors seeking a hedge against inflation or a safe haven in times of market turmoil. Silver ETFs are generally structured as grantor trusts, a typical structure for funds whose assets are a single commodity held physically in a vault. This grantor trust structure allows each share represented by the ETF the specific right to a particular quantity of silver, measured in ounces.​​​
The silver ETF universe is comprised of just 2 distinct ETFs, excluding inverse and leveraged ETFs and ones with assets of less than $50 million. The best performing silver ETF for Q3 2020, based on performance over the past year, is the Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF ( SIVR ). We examine these two silver ETFs below.
