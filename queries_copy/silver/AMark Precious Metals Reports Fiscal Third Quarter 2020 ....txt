EL SEGUNDO, Calif., May  07, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMRK), a leading full-service provider of products and services to the global precious metals market, reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2020.
Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 decreased 1% to $1.26 billion from $1.27 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and increased 19% from $1.06 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019
Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased 158% to $22.5 million (1.79% of revenue) from $8.7 million (0.69% of revenue) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and increased 176% from $8.1 million (0.8% of revenue) for the three months ended December 31, 2019
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2020 totaled $11.3 million or $1.61 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $990,000 or $0.14 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and net income of $1.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2019
Gold ounces sold in the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased 7% to 508,000 ounces from 474,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and increased 19% from 428,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2019
Silver ounces sold in the three months ended March 31, 2020 increased 54% to 25.7 million ounces from 16.8 million ounces for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and increased 82% from 14.1 million from the three months ended December 31, 2019
As of March 31, 2020, the number of secured loans decreased 83% to 429 from 2,568 as of March 31, 2019 and decreased 88% from 3,725 as of December 31, 2019
Revenues decreased 1% to $1.26 billion from $1.27 billion in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to lower forward sales, offset by an increase in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold and higher selling prices of gold and silver.
Gross profit increased 158% to $22.5 million (1.79% of revenue) from $8.7 million (0.69% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. This increase was due to higher gross profits earned by the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services and Direct Sales segments and was driven primarily by significantly wider trading spreads as a result of increased demand, and higher trading profits.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26% to $10.4 million from $8.3 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in performance-based compensation accruals of $2.3 million and depreciation expense of $0.3 million, which were partially offset by decreases in consulting expenses of $0.1 million and operating expenses of $0.5 million associated with the Company’s Direct Sales segment.
Interest income increased 24% to $6.0 million from $4.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to higher interest income from the Secured Lending segment and other finance product income.
Interest expense increased 19% to $5.1 million from $4.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily related to the Company’s notes payable, liabilities on borrowed metals, product financing arrangements, and loan servicing fees, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to our Trading Credit Facility.
Net income totaled $11.3 million or $1.61 per diluted share, an improvement from $990,000 or $0.14 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.
Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 decreased ­­4% to $3.80 billion from $3.93 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2019

The increase was primarily due to increases in performance-based compensation accruals of $2.8 million and depreciation expense of $0.3 million, which were partially offset by decreases in consulting expenses of $0.2 million and operating expenses of $0.6 million associated with the Company’s Direct Sales segment.

“Our record financial results and operational performance in the third quarter demonstrate the scalability of our platform and the demand for A-Mark’s physical products, which increased significantly during the quarter,” said company CEO Greg Roberts. “Recent macroeconomic and other events have created significant demand, related supply constraints and unprecedented volatility in the precious metals market. Our ability to successfully utilize our existing platforms to improve profitability in this environment is both a reflection of our combined team’s resiliency and a result of the investments we have made to increase capacity and operational capabilities in key areas such as our Direct Sales segment, Logistics, 24/7 online trading platform and Minting services.
“Our financial performance in fiscal Q3 was also a direct result of the flexibility in our business model, designed to maintain a baseline of profitability irrespective of market conditions but with the ability to adapt and capitalize on upside opportunities during periods of market volatility; the $22.5 million in gross profit and $11.3 million in net income we realized during the quarter exemplifies our model.  In fact, Q3’s net income level was higher than any fiscal full year period since A-Mark became a publicly traded company in 2014.
“With one of the most expansive product and service offerings in the industry, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market conditions by optimizing our business platform, while continuing to increase market share and driving growth over the long term.”

The company's CEO Greg Roberts, President Thor Gjerdrum and CFO Kathleen Simpson-Taylor will host the call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time).
