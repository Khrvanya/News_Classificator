Silver ounces sold in the three months ended December 31, 2019 decreased 30% to 14.1 million ounces from 20.0 million ounces for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and decreased 33% from 20.9 million from the three months ended September 30, 2019
As of December 31, 2019, the number of secured loans increased 93% to 3,725 from 1,931 as of December 31, 2018 and increased 4% from 3,571 as of September 30, 2019
Revenues decreased 4% to $1.06 billion from $1.10 billion in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to lower forward sales and a decrease in the total amount of gold and silver ounces sold, offset by higher gold and silver prices.
Gross profit decreased 2% to $8.1 million (0.8% of revenue) from $8.3 million (0.8% of revenue) in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower gross profit from the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary Services segment, offset by higher gross profit from the Direct Sales segment and higher trading profits.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% to $7.9 million from $8.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating expenses incurred by the Direct Sales segment of $0.1 million, consulting expenses of $0.2 million and recoveries on insurance claims of $0.2 million, which were partially offset by increased overall compensation costs of $0.2 million.
Interest income increased 34% to $6.2 million from $4.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to higher interest income from the Secured Lending segment and other finance product income.
Interest expense increased 9% to $5.1 million from $4.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Company’s Trading Credit Facility, product financing arrangements, and loan servicing fees, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to liabilities on borrowed metals and the Goldline Credit Facility, which was paid off in full during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Net income totaled $1.2 million or $0.17 per diluted share, an improvement from $577,000 or $0.08 per diluted share in the same year-ago quarter.

Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2019 decreased 2% to $16.5 million (0.6% of revenue) from $16.8 million (0.6% of revenue) for the six months ended December 31, 2018
Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2019 totaled $1.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2018
Gold ounces sold in the six months ended December 31, 2019 increased 3% to 1,004,000 ounces from 975,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2018
Silver ounces sold in the six months ended December 31, 2019 decreased 9% to 35.0 million ounces from 38.3 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018
Revenues decreased 5% to $2.54 billion from $2.67 billion in the same year-ago period. The decrease was primarily due to lower forward sales and lower silver ounces sold, offset by an increase in higher gold and silver prices and higher gold ounces sold.
Gross profit decreased 2% to $16.5 million (0.6% of revenue) from $16.8 million (0.6% of revenue) in the same year-ago period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower gross profit from the Wholesale Trading & Ancillary segment, offset by improved gross profit from the Direct Sales segment and higher trading profits.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% to $16.1 million from $15.8 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to higher overall compensation costs of $0.3 million and deductibles on insurance claims of $0.2 million, which were partially offset by lower operating expenses incurred by the Direct Sales segment of $0.1 million and lower information technology costs of $0.2 million.
Interest income increased 30% to $12 million from $9.2 million in the same year-ago period. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to interest income earned by the Secured Lending Segment and other finance product income.
Interest expense increased 25% to $10.2 million from $8.2 million in the same year-ago period. The increase in interest expense was related primarily to the Company’s Trading Credit Facility, notes payable, product financing arrangements, and loan servicing fees, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to liabilities on borrowed metals and the Goldline Credit Facility, which was paid off in full during second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Net income totaled $1.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.
“The second quarter was highlighted by double-digit growth in interest income and stabilized operating expenses, which drove the second consecutive quarter of profitability,” said company CEO Greg Roberts. “This consistent performance is due to our diversified platform of products and services as well as the cost optimization measures we implemented in fiscal 2019 which made A-Mark a leaner organization. Our Secured Lending segment continues to perform well and provides us with solid interest income, as demonstrated by the record number of loans outstanding at quarter end, which was up 93% year-over-year.
“Overall, we’re encouraged by our operational and financial performance in the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020, and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year. We believe our competitive position, robust platform, expanding customer base and diversified business model will help drive predictable growth and increased profitability in the years ahead.”
