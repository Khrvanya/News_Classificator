PITTSFIELD - The body of a man who drowned while swimming in Silver Lake was recovered Monday night following a search for several hours by emergency personnel in boats and dive teams, according to the Pittsfield Fire Department.
The body was recovered at around 9 p.m., a little more than 6 hours after the first report of a possible drowning came in at 2:45 p.m.
Two boys who were fishing near Silver Lake Boulevard and Fourth Street reported seeing a man swimming near them and then heard him yelling for help.

He was described as in his 50s or 60s.
Several agencies responded to participate in the search including the Pittsfield Police and Fire Departments, the Berkshire County Sheriff’s Department and Massachusetts State Police dive teams, Massachusetts Environmental Police, Department of Fire Services, and the Lanesboro, Hinsdale, and Stockbridge fire departments.
