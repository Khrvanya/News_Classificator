Bang-bang: gangster dramas all set to fire up the silver screen!
As filmmaker Sanjay Gupta readies to wrap up work on Mumbai Saga, we take a look at how multiple gangster/underworld films are in various stages of production right now
Alia Bhatt-starrer Gangubai Kathiawadi is based on author S Hussain Zaidi’s book, Mafia Queens of Mumbai about Gangubai Kothewali, the madam of a brothel in Kamathipura
What’s common between Deewar (1975), Parinda (1989), Satya (1998), Vaastav (1999), Shootout At Lokhandwala (2007), Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010) and Shootout At Wadala (2013)? They are all gangster dramas which set the box office on fire.
