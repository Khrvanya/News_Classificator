Strangely, one of the toughest segments to decipher in this new normal is gold stocks to buy. It’s not just a matter of which entity to acquire. Rather, investors have questioned whether they should engage this market at all. With recent positive economic and consumer-level data providing confidence to equities, it appears that we’re on a recovery path.
For instance, earlier in June, the surprisingly upbeat May jobs report gave a much-needed confidence boost to Wall Street. Later, we found out that retail sales in May jumped nearly 18% from April. In a way, these announcements represented a backdoor repudiation of gold stocks to buy.
Nevertheless, I wouldn’t get too comfortable adopting a risk-on attitude. While the percentage gains in terms of jobs added and consumer spending are impressive, we’re also talking about comparisons against dramatically deflated levels. More importantly, several high-level economists have sounded the alarm regarding long-term economic damage. Initial weekly jobless claims that continue to number in the millions suggest that pain is spreading to multiple job sectors.
Also, the novel coronavirus itself is grabbing headlines again. At first, states justified their reopening measures as the country supposedly succeeded in flattening the curve. Still, the number of new daily infections remained uncomfortably high. Now, a report indicates that cases in Florida and Texas are surging . Thus, I don’t think we’re done with the idea of treating gold stocks as relative safe havens.
Truly, this is an unprecedented situation. Beyond that, there are no easy or possibly even correct answers. From my perspective, we have to decide on the least bad choice. But if there’s one thing I’m confident about, it’s that these nine gold stocks to buy have suddenly become supremely relevant.
