Global markets remain in the crossfire as policymakers attempt to offset the economic slowdown emanating from the novel coronavirus.
The upcoming jobless claims report out of the United States takes on even more importance than usual as this will be one of the first looks at just how hard the US labor market has been hit by shutdowns.
The Fed announced even more emergency accommodation around market open yesterday: US equity futures went limit down anyways. More pressing, it appears, is a stimulus package getting passed by Congress.
Another weekly open and another announcement from the FOMC designed to, hopefully, arrest the global declines that have eviscerated pretty much every equity index on Earth, at least outside of China. In the US, both the Dow and S&P 500 passed the 30% marker last week, extending their respective slides into the weekly close as the idea of holding risk over the weekend just did not appear very appealing.
That statement can be made on both sides of the matter, even for bears that have seen a precipitous decline over the past month as risk aversion has enveloped global markets. Weekend announcements out of the Fed are becoming a more normal thing; and each time the bank has increased the size and scope of the respective bazooka. Most recently, the Fed announced open-ended QE . This is on top of last weekend’s announcement for $500 billion in Treasuries and $200 billion in mortgage backed securities to be purchased, along with an emergency rate cut of 100 basis points. The one thing that’s clear is that the Fed isn’t going to stop employing stimulus measures in an effort to offset crisis-related moves from the continued growth of the novel coronavirus.
The bigger question is if this will help to arrest the major sell-offs that have engulfed global markets over the past month; or whether some element of fiscal stimulus is going to be needed to help to turn the tides.
