The Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 continued their upward trajectory last week as new coronavirus cases in the United States appeared to slow and the first round of stimulus checks were delivered to eligible Americans. Still, threats to the rebound rally remain as funding for small business assistance quickly dried up and the early stages of earnings season revealed a troubled outlook for the months ahead.
In all of the coronavirus-induced madness, the Nasdaq has emerged as a clear frontrunner among the three major US indices – despite its higher exposure to the “risky” technology sector. Evidenced in the chart above, the Nasdaq has continued its outperformance over the Dow Jones and S&P 500 as some of the leading tech stocks stand above more traditional businesses.
That being said, recent equity gains have become highly concentrated in a few stocks. As a result the S&P 500 has climbed faster in the recent rebound than its equal-weighted counterpart, which is not unusual, but the degree to which the two have diverged is notable. Consequently, we can surmise the rebound has on the back of targeted strength rather than a widespread economic boom that would lift an entire market.
