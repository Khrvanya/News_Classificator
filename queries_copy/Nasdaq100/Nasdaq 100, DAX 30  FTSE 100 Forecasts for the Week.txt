Nasdaq 100, DAX 30 & FTSE 100 Price Outlooks:
The Nasdaq 100 has climbed above and beyond other major indices, but has seen its ascent slow
Devoid of major event risk, the DAX 30 and FTSE 100 may be susceptible to broader risk appetite
After climbing above 10,000 for the first time in history just two weeks ago, the Nasdaq 100 has seen its ascent slow as investors juggle the threat of a second coronavirus wave with accommodative monetary policy. Although the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have pledged further assistance, should it be required, it seems the market cannot fully disregard the implications of another possible lockdown period.
Thus, a degree of apprehension has seeped into the tech-heavy Nasdaq which has long been the leader of the price recovery. A simultaneous pause has occurred in the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet as it recorded its largest weekly decline this year last week, around -1 percent, and it is unlikely the two occurrences are entirely coincidental. Either way, as the trailblazer of the recent recovery, the slowdown in the Nasdaq’s climb has spilled over into other indices as the Dow Jones , S&P 500 and others meander beneath recent highs.
Consequently, it can be argued the Nasdaq 100 remains closely tied to the Fed’s balance sheet expansion and covid developments. As it stands, multiple Fed officials have hinted that the economy may take longer to recover than many are currently expecting, but as Chairman Jerome Powell has already vowed to act “aggressively and proactively” to keep the economy afloat, market participants can be assured the central bank is at their back. Therefore, it is difficult to suggest a sharp reversal can gather steam in the current climate, unless a new threat emerges.
