What does it all mean?
Start with Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading: Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets. Arora’s Second Law is especially applicable to these stock market conditions because not enough is known about coronavirus at this time. Here are the key points:
• Based on the foregoing, if it weren’t for the Fed’s money printing, I could confidently say that the stock market top is in and the prior high will not be seen in a long time. However, think about the 1% yield on 10-year Treasury bonds. That is equivalent to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 100 on stocks. In comparison, a P/E of 20 for the stock market is relatively inexpensive and perhaps even a bargain. Moreover, the Fed seems to be on track to cut interest rates further and print more money. Such moves will make stocks even more attractive.
• Refrain from thinking there are only two outcomes: Stocks are going to go straight up or they are going to crash. In the emails I get, a vast majority of investors are convinced that they need to go all in buying stocks now or they want to sell all of their stocks now. Please see “ Prudent investors should look at these four stock charts as coronavirus spreads .”
• We provide specific levels of cash and hedges to protect long-term portfolios and short-term trades to take advantage of the wild swings. Investors’ focus should shift to how they can make money irrespective of what happens. Please see “ As the stock market rallies, put protections on your investing portfolio .”
• To be able to make money under all market conditions, investors may want to pay attention to Arora’s Third Law of Investing and Trading: Making investing and trading decisions based on probabilities is the only realistic and profitable approach.
Consider carefully reading what Warren Buffett said: “ Buffett is bullish on stocks but says the market can drop 50% — is he wrong? ”
