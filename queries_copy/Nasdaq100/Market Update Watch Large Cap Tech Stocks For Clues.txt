Today’s chart focuses on the market leader, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX).
It recently broke its up-trend line and may now be rallying to test its underside.
The Nasdaq 100 has suffered the same deterioration in price trend and momentum as has the S&P 500 Index. So while a bounce occurred on Monday, it’s thought that prices might not push too much higher this week before some additional consolidation takes place.
Large-cap Technology largely has not suffered much damage, so stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN will be key to watch in the days ahead for any evidence of waning / caution.
Leave this field empty if you're human:
1) This remains a bear market bounce, NOT the start of a new bull market
2) Any stalling out in early/mid-May that backtracks likely will NOT reach new lows right away given the extent of our rally.
