With an uptick in volatility and a weakened technical pattern, the Nasdaq 100 runs the risk of further instability
Nasdaq 100 Forecast for the Week: Technical Patterns Weakened
The Nasdaq 100 scored an incredible achievement last week as the tech-heavy index broke above 10,000 for the first time in history. Still, the milestone was unable to ward off risk aversion as market participants underwent a shift in sentiment following the June 10 FOMC rate decision. The change in attitude gave way to a precipitous decline that was reminiscent of price action in February and March. As a result, the ascending channel that had helped guide the index higher since April suffered a topside breach followed by an almost immediate break lower, both of which work to erode the pattern’s structure.
Consequently, the formation has been badly damaged and it may provide less guidance going forward. In the bullish case, having fewer topside barriers is rarely a problem, but the weakened lower-bound may allow for a subsequent selloff to explore lower. Further still, recent price action does not speak to stability as 2,000-point swings on the Dow Jones hardly inspire confidence. Thus, we are left with what is arguably a more-fragile Nasdaq 100 compared to early last week – despite a relatively modest change in price.
