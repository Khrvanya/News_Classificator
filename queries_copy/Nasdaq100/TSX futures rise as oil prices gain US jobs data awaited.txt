(Reuters) - Canada's main stock index inched higher on Thursday, helped by gains in energy stocks on higher oil prices, while a jump in monthly exports and a record pace of U.S. jobs growth also bolstered sentiment.
The U.S. economy created jobs at a record clip in June as more restaurants and bars resumed operations, further evidence that the COVID-19 recession was probably over, though a surge in cases of the coronavirus threatens the fledgling recovery.
Meanwhile, oil prices gained as a sharp drop in oil stockpiles outweighed concerns that the spike in infections and new lockdown measures in California could stall recovery in fuel demand.
