Innovator announces April upside cap ranges for Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, and Emerging Markets Power Buffer Listings
Innovator Capital Management has announced the anticipated upside cap ranges for the April Series of S&P 500 Buffer ETFs, which reset at month end.
Innovator also plans to expand its category-creating Defined Outcome ETF suite with four additional Power Buffer ETFs (April Series) scheduled to begin trading on 1 April, 2020, based on the Nasdaq 100, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, and MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes.
“One of the benefits of Defined Outcome ETFs is that increased market volatility typically contributes positively to upside caps, providing investors with greater potential upside participation over the next one-year outcome period,” says Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator ETFs. “This unique feature is in stark contrast to most risk management strategies, which typically reduce market exposure as volatility increases.
