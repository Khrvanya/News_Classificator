S&P 500 | Is the Best Behind Us?
Nasdaq 100 | Fresh Record High, Beware of Bearish Divergence
S&P 500 | Is the Best Behind Us?
The S&P 500 has broken above key resistance in the form of the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the Q1 crash, which in turn has opened the door to further gains. Eyes will be on the weekly close, whereby a hold above 3200 may keep topside resistance at 3260 within its site. While bullish momentum this week has shown little signs of easing, 3260 could pave the way for slight consolidation. Alongside this, given the size of the rally in equities, current levels suggest that the best may be behind us, much like the Nasdaq 100, which hit a fresh record high. On the downside, support in the S&P 500 is situated in the low 3100s.
