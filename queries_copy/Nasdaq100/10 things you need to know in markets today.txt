The Nasdaq 100 includes the shares of the 100 largest American and international companies as measured by their market capitalization which do not come from the financial sector and which are traded on the largest electronic stock exchange in the USA, the Nasdaq. It has been published since 31 January 1985. Its baseline value at this time was established at a level of 250 points; in 1994 the Nasdaq 100 was divided and its baseline value was halved as a result.
Like the Swiss Market Index (SMI), the Nasdaq 100 is a price index. The shares included in it are weighted according to market capitalization; the index level represents the average of the shares included in it.  Dividend payments are not considered when calculating the index.
In order to be included in the Nasdaq 100, a share must fulfill certain criteria. For example, the company must already have been listed on the Nasdaq for two years, and must have sufficiently high share capitalization and a certain trading volume. The composition of the Nasdaq 100 and the weighting of the shares included in it are reviewed once annually and adjusted where necessary.
The Nasdaq 100 is traded each trading day between 3:30 pm and 10:00 pm CET; the index level is calculated continuously once a second in real time.
