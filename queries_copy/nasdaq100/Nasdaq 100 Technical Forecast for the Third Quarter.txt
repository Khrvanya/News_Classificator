Nasdaq 100 Third Quarter Forecast:
Breaching prior highs and key psychological barriers in its price recovery, the Nasdaq was a beacon of strength in second quarter and its technical layout is crucial as a result
The Nasdaq 100 has become one of the most important indices in the world as it leads the way in the coronavirus recovery rally. With high exposure to market-leading stocks like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, the tech-heavy index has grown into somewhat of a proxy for price action on other indices like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 . As US indices can loosely dictate the direction of price action in other equity markets, it can be said the Nasdaq’s role in the current market environment is crucial.
Therefore, the defined technical structure within which the Nasdaq trades may serve to provide key insight into the health of broader equity price action. Nearing the topside of an ascending channel that has contained price for more than a decade, it is hard to entirely discard the threat of a reversal lower amidst the highly uncertain fundamental backdrop.
