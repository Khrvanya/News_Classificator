The S&P 500, up 0.41% on the day, briefly breached its July 26 closing high and came within a point of breaking its intraday high of 3,027.98.
The Nasdaq 100, meanwhile, soared to a new intraday high of 8,032.35 and closed up 0.78% to a new closing high of 8,029.22. The old closing high was 8,021.35, also set on July 26. The day's catalyst was that chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said it sees more growth ahead, especially in sales of server chips.
But Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) also contributed to the Nasdaq-100's new highs.
The Dow Jones industrials finished up 0.57% and ended the day off 1.53% below its all-time high in July. The gain was fueled in part by new highs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).
The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% on the day and is 1.2% below its peak.
The market's gains were quite broad except for interest-rate sensitive stocks, like utilities.
