Kottakkal: 34-year-old Thamarassery native works as an accountant at a private company in Dubai. He is not paid for past two months due to lockdown. He has no money to make both ends meet and even the next meal is uncertain. Desperate to reach home, he called the number given by a friend.
“Then we will provide free ticket. But you will have to carry home something for us.”
When he realised the something was gold, he soon replied, “sorry, I am not going home”.
When the expats are reeling in Covid scare and trying to reach home somehow, the smugglers are providing tempting offers. For a person to secure a ticket on a chartered flight, it would cost around Rs 18,500 to Rs 26,500. If 1 kg of gold is transported, the smugglers can save Rs 4.5 lakh.
Even if ticket is given free of cost, the smugglers are at profit. 400g to 1kg gold will be transported by one person. A passenger on a Covid special chartered flight from Ras al Khaimah had hid 736g of gold in his private parts. More gold can be hid in hair and other body parts.
The mafia will provide training for the carriers. More than 3kg of gold was seized from Kozhikode airport in past few days. Only few suspicious people are examined thoroughly removing PPE kit and clothes.
When there are Covid patients or those with symptoms, detailed inspections are not done. Also the increased number of passengers in present situation makes it difficult for thorough checking. When gold is mixed with other chemical solutions and hid in body parts, metal detectors fail to spot it.
