While the feat is impressive for BTS, Oricon also shared that this marks the first time in 36 years that a foreign artist has topped their albums chart for the first half in the year. The last artist to accomplish this was none other than Michael Jackson, who managed to do so with his iconic, mega-selling Thriller album in 1984. It’s further notable as Japan has a very healthy album and record industry particularly for its local artists with physical albums and DVDs still major sources of revenues for artists and labels.
The Oricon news and “Stay Gold” all come ahead of BTS’ Map of the Soul: 7 ~The Journey~ album that will be released in Japan and digitally worldwide on July 14. There will be a CD version available in the U.S. on August 7. The album will include new original songs (including the previously released "Lights," below) as well as Japanese remakes of past Korean singles (like their Billboard chart hits "On," Boy With Luv," "Fake Love," "Idol," "Make It Right" and more).
