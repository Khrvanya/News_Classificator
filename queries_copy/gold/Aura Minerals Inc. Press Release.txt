The number of Base Offering BDRs was increased by 6,430 BDRs offered by a certain individual shareholder of the Company, under the same conditions and at the same price of the Base Offering BDRs (the “Additional BDRs”).
The total gross amount of the Base Offering and the Additional BDRs is R$790,113,460.00 (or C$197,291,330.96, based on the daily average rate of exchange published by the Bank of Canada on June 30, 2020). Gross proceeds to the Company from the Primary Offering is R$271,447,060.00 (or C$67,780,330.88, based on the daily average rate of exchange published by the Bank of Canada on June 30, 2020), before deducting the underwriting discount and estimated Offering expenses.
Upon the issuance of the Shares underlying the Primary Offering BDRs, the total number of issued and outstanding Shares of the Company will be 4,685,635 Shares.
In addition to the Additional BDRs, the number of Base Offering BDRs may be increased by up to 15%, corresponding to up to 143,568 BDRs, of which 49,655 BDRs are to be offered by the Company (the “Primary Over-Allotment BDRs”) and 93,913 BDRs are to be offered by the Base Offering Selling Shareholder (the “Secondary Over-Allotment BDRs” and, together with the Primary Over-Allotment BDRs, the “Over-Allotment BDRs”), under the same conditions and at the same price of the Base Offering BDRs, pursuant to an option granted by the Company and the Base Offering Selling Shareholder to the Brazilian Underwriter that will act as stabilization agent, for the purposes of the services of stabilization of the price of the BDRs in connection with the Offering.
The BDRs being offered in the Offering have been approved for listing and admission to trading on the B3 S.A. – Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão (the “B3”). Listing of the Shares underlying the Primary Offering BDRs and the Primary Over-Allotment BDRs has been conditionally approved by the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”), subject to the Company fulfilling all of the listing requirements of the TSX.
The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the Offering to fund (i) continuous development, maintenance and expansion of the Company's producing assets; (ii) exploration and development of projects that are not yet in commercial production; and (iii) reinforcement of the Company's capital structure.
The Company expects the first trading date of the BDRs on the B3 to occur on July 6, 2020, settlement of the Base Offering BDRs and the Additional BDRs to occur on July 7, 2020, and completion of the Offering to occur on or before August 11, 2020.
In connection with facilitating the stabilization procedures customary for an offering of this kind in Brazil, Northwestern Enterprises Ltd. (“Northwestern”), a company controlled by Mr. Paulo Brito, the chairman of the board of the Company, has agreed to loan to the Brazilian Underwriter that will act as stabilization agent 143,568 BDRs, representing 15% of the Base Offering BDRs (the “Northwestern Stabilization Loan”). As consideration for entering into the Northwestern Stabilization Loan, Northwestern will receive a fee equal to 0.00001% per annum of the product obtained when the number of BDRs loaned by Northwestern is multiplied by the Price per BDR, calculated pro rata daily for the term of the loan, which amount is intended to be nominal. The Northwestern Stabilization Loan may be considered to be a “related party transaction” for purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61‑101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the Offering more than 21 days before the expected closing date of the Offering because the Company wants to close the Offering on an expedited basis for sound business reasons. The Company is exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 in accordance with section 5.5(a) and section 5.7(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the fair market value of the transaction, insofar as it involves interested parties, is not more than the 25% of the Company’s market capitalization.
