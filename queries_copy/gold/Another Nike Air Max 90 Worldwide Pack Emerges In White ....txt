With two entries in the Nike Worldwide Pack already under its tongue, the Nike Air Max 90 has emerged in another globetrotting-inspired arrangement. Unlike adjacent pairs, however, the silhouette’s latest opts for a subtle, yet regal ensemble for women.
The mixed-materials upper are predominantly clad in white, with its leather overlays boasting an ever-so-slightly darker shade. Additionally, swaths fixed atop the mesh base sport barely-discernible “NIKE WORLDWIDE” graphics. A champagne hue interrupts the rather-tonal color scheme across both traditionally-placed branding and the “Worldwide Pack” specific detailing; profile Swooshes and “ AIR MAX ” text indulge in a shimmering finish, just as logos on the toe, tongue, and heel. Underfoot, the Airbag enclosure also partakes in a golden makeup, while its accompanying midsole cushioning goes simple with white. By contrast, the waffle outsole features a translucent, champagne-speckled arrangement that reveals “ナイキ” characters (“Nike” in Japanese).
Official Nike.com release details are still unknown, but this Air Max 90 “Worldwide Pack” is rumored to launch in Asia on July 24th. In the meantime, enjoy official images of the women’s pair ahead.
