Are Gold Stocks Driving The UK Market Recovery?
Gold is one of the few commodities, that is generally not impacted much by any cyclical movement of the financial market or any other specific disasters.
In the year 2019, there was an increase in the demand for gold, which continued its momentum in 2020 as well. This has also come out to be true during the current Covid-19 Pandemic phase, as Gold prices have continued to rise in the last 3 months.
At the time of writing on 14th April 2020, at 01:30 P.M, GMT, the spot price of gold was reported to be at US $1728.99 per Ounce, which was an increase of approximately 12.05 per cent in the price of gold in the last three months from the price of US $1543.00 per ounce on 14th January 2020, and also an increase of approximately 13.06 per cent in the last one month from the price of US $1529.25 per ounce on 14th March 2020. As people consider gold to be an extremely safe asset, especially during periods of crisis, it has been observed that it wasn’t just the price of gold that increased, but there was also a significant jump in per day global trading volume of Gold in the last three months. This means that people are generally moving their investments from equities, which are considered to be risky, or other highly volatile assets, towards gold, which is the safe haven.
Will the Gold prices continue to increase?
Even though there has been a continued increase in demand over the last few months for gold, the supply has also increased. Now, during this phase of increased uncertainty globally, experts have suggested that the demand for all commodities, including gold, might go down. In such a case where, ample supply has been maintained, and when demand is expected to go down, prices generally go down. There is also historical evidence for the fact that people are generally ready to pay extra for gold, even during times of uncertainty. Hence, currently, it is extremely difficult to predict how the price of gold will react to the aftereffects of Covid-19 in the times to come.
Price of gold in the commodity market also has a huge impact on the companies that engage in the explore and extraction of gold. Hence, we have curated a list of companies, that should be under the investors’ watch in the times to come, as and when there is a significant change in the price of gold. The following is a brief stock price performance analysis of four such FTSE listed companies, that have done well in the last three months, as the price of gold has steadily increased.
