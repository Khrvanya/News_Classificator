KUALA LUMPUR (AFP) - Lee Zii Jia's charge up the badminton rankings has sparked hopes that Malaysia has found a successor to the legendary Lee Chong Wei - and someone who can finally win the country a first Olympic gold.
The 22-year-old jumped to world No. 10 after establishing himself in the sport's elite with some big-name scalps at the start of this year before play was suspended because of the coronavirus.
He defeated China's Olympic champion Chen Long to reach the semi-finals of the prestigious All England Open in March, and beat China's ninth-ranked Shi Yuqi at the Malaysia Masters in January.
But he remains relaxed about being touted as the heir to fellow Malaysian Lee Chong Wei, a three-time Olympic silver medallist and one of the greatest players of his generation until his retirement last year.
"From the beginning, everybody said I am the next Lee Chong Wei, that I am going to replace him," he told AFP.
"It made me (feel) pressure but now, slowly, I have become more mature.
"I am starting to accept those pressures, and turn them into motivation."
The major disappointment in former world No. 1 Chong Wei's glittering career was that he failed to win badminton's biggest prizes, being beaten to gold by his nemesis Lin Dan of China in the 2008 and 2012 Olympic finals, and the World Championships in 2011 and 2013.
But Zii Jia, despite the weight of expectation, is downplaying his chances of winning gold at the virus-delayed Tokyo Games next year, which would be his first Olympics.
"I don't think about it... I will just go and try my best to gain some experience," he said. "For me no pressure, just go and fight, and try my best."
He has received advice from the elder Lee, 37, and is using the same two coaches his compatriot did before the 2016 Rio Olympics.
