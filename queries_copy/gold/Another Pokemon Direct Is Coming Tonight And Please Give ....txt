The Pokemon Company has announced another Pokemon Direct that is set for June 24th (tomorrow) at 11pm AEST.
The company last week announced Pokemon Snap , Pokemon Cafe and Pokemon Smile and said that there would be another presentation in the near future that would feature a larger project.
It’s been thought that this could be pointing to Pokemon Let’s Go Johto (Gold/Silver remakes) as the last presentation heavily pointed to Pokemon from the Johto region.
