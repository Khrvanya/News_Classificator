We bow down to the creative team at Big Hit Entertainment. With every BTS video, they leave the ARMY spellbound. Take Stay Gold as an example. The new music video was released today and it was one of the warmest videos we've seen this year. RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook sprinkled some gold to remind us to keep our shine intact, regardless of the circumstances. While we were inspired to chase the gold even in our darkest hours, the music video left us spellbound for it drew parallels to numerous BTS songs.
The most in your face parallel was featuring Jungkook. The video starts with JK making his way down the corridor and pepping out a window. The scene instantly brought back memories of the Still With You crooner from Fake Love, where he was seen running down the corridor as the floor beneath him demolishes.
Another parallel that fans noticed featured Jungkook and Taehyung. While it isn't necessarily a connection but fans couldn't help remember Jungkook from Spring Day when TaeTae lights up the match stick to burn the books down. Another scene from Stay Gold featured Jungkook hidden away in a dark underground space which reminded everyone of I Need U.
Check out a few fan observations below:
