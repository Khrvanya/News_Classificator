5 Top Stock Trades for Wednesday: GLD, MU, GOLD, INO, UBER

It’s the last day of the quarter, and we’re seeing some interesting moves in the stock market. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades for Wednesday.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Gold (GLD)
Gold prices have been trading better lately. Despite investors knowing all about the Federal Reserve and other central banks printing money to stave off an economic collapse, the yellow metal has only slowly crept higher.
While the action has frustrated the bulls, it’s been moving in the right direction — as evidenced by the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GLD ).
Last week, the GLD broke out over $164 resistance and has since retested this level to find it as support. I love breakouts like that, as the retest solidifies the bull case. The GLD is hitting new highs on the move on Tuesday.
From here, see that $164 continues to act as support on the downside. On the upside, though, see if the 138.2% extension is hit at $138.25, followed by the 161.8% extension up at $173.74.
