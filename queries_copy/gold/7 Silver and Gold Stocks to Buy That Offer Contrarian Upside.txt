At first glance, the case for gold stocks to buy appears incredibly challenged right now. One of the biggest impediments to a rising equities market has been the U.S.-China trade war. Recently, though, both sides appear willing to negotiate. Even President Donald Trump, no stranger to angry rhetoric, appeared optimistic for a substantive trade deal.
Wall Street has given Trump the benefit of the doubt, significantly hurting the case for gold stocks to buy. Both the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, along with the benchmark S&P 500 have charged to all-time highs. In sharp contrast, gold prices, which have looked so strong this year due to rising fear and uncertainty, have slid downward this month.
But before you get too complacent, Yahoo Finance contributor Rick Newman brought up an excellent question: Why is the Street giving any credibility to Trump? As Newman bluntly put it, “There is, in fact, no trade deal with China .” Further, he provides his readers with a warning from the not-so-distant past:
“Last December, after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said, ‘It’s an incredible deal. It goes down, certainly, if it happens, it goes down as one of the largest deals ever made.’ If you’re wondering what deal that was, well, yes — there was no deal.”
Thus, I don’t think the thesis for gold stocks to buy is dead. And even if a trade deal materializes, I recently presented my argument for why big banks are in trouble . Namely, the economy is nowhere near as healthy as advertised.
This pressured environment dramatically raises the profile for gold miners. Additionally, don’t ignore the potential for silver stocks to buy.
