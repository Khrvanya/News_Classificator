Here is how SMC expects commodities to trade today:
Spices: Turmeric futures (Mar) are expected to hold on to their three-month support levels near Rs 6,380, while the upside may remain capped near Rs 6,670. According to traders, the quality of arrivals in the mandis is lower. On the contrary, the demand from North India is continuing to be sluggish. The market is now eyeing the arrival of new crops, which will start from the end of next month. Additionally, the sufficient carryover stocks are weighing on prices. Jeera futures (Jan) will probably trade sideways and consolidate in the range of Rs 16,050-16,300. Coriander futures (Jan) are likely to trade higher and test Rs 7,000. The supplies are getting affected on the spot markets of Rajasthan due to an intense cold wave. While on the other side, the adverse weather conditions in key growing areas have hit the sown crop. Cardamom futures (Jan) are likely to trade higher towards Rs 3,850-3,900.
Oilseeds: Soybean futures (Jan) are likely to trade sideways in the range of Rs 4,390-4,480. The sentiments are firm due to strong demand from crushing plants amid lower supply in spot markets. Quality damage and yield loss has been reported for the new season crop due to the unseasonal and extended rainfall. Apart from quality, output is also expected to remain lower than its preliminary estimates. Mustard futures (Jan) are likely to face resistance near Rs 4,745. However, the support in near term is at Rs 4,620. Market participants are cautious and closely watch the flowering stage of this oilseed and the impact of the ongoing severe winters on its yield. Soy oil futures (Jan) have already seen a run-up of more than 29 per cent last year and the gain doesn’t seem to take pause in the near future. In days to come, it may move upwards to test Rs 960-970, while taking support near Rs 920. Similarly, CPO rallied more than 45 per cent year-on-year. The bullish news coming from international markets is that Indonesia is pushing for biodiesel mandatory to mix 30 per cent palm-based fueling a bid to slash its fuel import bill and boost domestic palm oil consumption, will definitely act as a catalyst for rocketing palm oil prices.
Other commodities: Cotton on the national bourse is trapped in a sideways movement following its bearish fundamentals of rising supplies on the spot markets. There are possibilities that it may consolidate in the range of Rs 19,500-19,700. According to traders, the mills are not ready to purchase cotton at the current price. On the supply side, the crop is seen higher and it may see better yields in the third and fourth rounds of picking due to better soil moisture. The Cotton Association of India estimated total cotton supply till end of the cotton season up to September 30, 2020 at 403 lakh bales of 170 kg. Cocud futures (Jan) can be seen taking support near Rs 2,100 and trade with an upside bias.
Gold and silver: Bullion counter may witness some profit booking at higher levels. US markets are closed today. Gold prices rose recently to a three-month high as the dollar weakened, with the precious metal set for its biggest annual rise in nearly a decade in 2019, when the US-China trade war had investors seeking safe harbors from a possible recession. The yellow metal can dip lower Rs 38,900 while taking resistance near Rs 39,100 and silver can dip towards Rs 46,200 while taking resistance near Rs 46,800. A lingering sense of caution over trade developments and lack of details on the phase 1 deal may also stimulate appetite for gold during Q1 of 2020.
Base metals: Base metals may trade with a sideways bias. Copper may test Rs 438 while taking resistance near Rs 442. Zinc can recover towards Rs 182 while taking support near Rs 178. Lead may trade with a sideways-to-upside bias, testing Rs 154 by taking support near Rs 151. Nickel may recover towards Rs 1,040 while taking support near Rs 1,020. Aluminum may dip towards Rs 135 while facing resistance near Rs 138. A thawing in the US-China trade war could fuel a rally in base metals in 2020 after the prolonged conflict largely kept a lid on prices in 2019.
Energy: Crude oil may witness profit booking at higher levels. Oil prices have followed the general de-risking drift into year-end despite a rise in Middle East tensions and last week’s bullish-for-oil-price inventory draws as the broader markets appear to be losing some of that holiday cheer. Crude oil can dip towards Rs 4,350 while facing resistance near Rs 4,420. One news story that could send prices higher, however, could be the EIA’s production report for October with actual figures from producers rather than estimates. The report is due out later today and could cause a spike in oil prices if, as some skeptics believe, the figure turns out lower than estimated by the EIA at the time, after reports began emerging that shale oil wells’ actual performance fell short of forecasts. Natural gas can bounce towards Rs 159 while taking support near Rs 155.
