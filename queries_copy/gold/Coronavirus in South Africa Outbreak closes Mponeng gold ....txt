How deep is the mine?
Mponeng mine, about 75km (50 miles) south-west of Johannesburg, extends up to 4km beneath the earth's surface.
Electronic tracking is used in case miners go missing, and this system was "useful in quickly locating primary, or close contacts" of those who tested positive, the owners said.
BBC World Service Africa editor Will Ross says this outbreak, which follows another at a platinum mine, will be of concern to the South African government as well as the companies.
South Africa's mines, where people often work in close proximity deep underground, have often been the epicentres for other communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV.
Despite years of relative decline, South Africa remains one of the world's biggest gold producers and the sector is a vital part of the national economy.
