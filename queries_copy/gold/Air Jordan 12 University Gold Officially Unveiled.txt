As part of its Fall 2020 collection, Jordan Brand has officially unveiled the Air Jordan 12 “University Gold”.
The two-tone release (which was first teased back in April) adds a fresh, but familiar update to the Air Jordan silhouette. Like its inaugural pair, the forthcoming Jordan 12 features a genuine leather upper and original lizard-patterned mudguard: The former is clad in “Black”, while the latter animates the retro in stark “University Gold” contrast. Branding throughout the tongue also sports the rich yellow hue. Further borrowing from its 1996-form, the Jordan 12 University Gold boasts a matte-finish across its metal eyelets. Outsoles, however, indulge in a barely-discernible, translucent makeup that blends in with its yellow surroundings. Similarly, carbon fiber shank plates forgo their original, “Taxi”-reminiscent arrangement in favor of a simple grey and black palette.
While no official release date has been confirmed, the Jordan 12 “University Gold” is scheduled to launch come Fall. Until then, enjoy a closer look at the pair here below, and bookmark our Jordan Release Dates post for updates.
