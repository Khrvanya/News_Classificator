We’ve only clocked in a month of the new year and already, fear and uncertainty are the dominant emotions. On the last trading session of January 2020, the Dow Jones lost 603 points, making it the worst one-day drop in four months . Deep-seated concerns about the coronavirus outbreak negatively impacted sentiment. But on another front, this is positive news for gold and silver stocks.
As you know, gold bullion is the classic hedge against equity volatility and general fears about economic and social stability. While many fear-inducing events have occurred over the last several years, this time seems different. For one thing, sentiment has turned very positive for the yellow metal and gold stocks. Since the end of November, the spot price for the precious metal has increased nearly 8%.
Further, as Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors notes, the coronavirus is a different animal to the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s. Today, we are much more connected both in terms of transportation and how information (or disinformation) travels via social media . Even if the coronavirus is a relatively benign bug, just the spread of exaggerated rumors can roil traditional investment markets. Again, though, this would theoretically be a positive for gold and silver stocks.
Even without this global health epidemic, gold stocks have responded well to underlying, though currently dormant tensions. As an example, North Korea has threatened belligerence recently. Also, the situation in Iran could quickly escalate.
I’m not guaranteeing calamity. But these events have the capacity to make precious metals great again. In the interest of not fighting the tape, here are 10 gold and silver stocks to consider.
