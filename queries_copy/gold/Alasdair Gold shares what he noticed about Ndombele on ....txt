It’s really quite difficult to keep on top of what’s happening with Tanguy Ndombele at Tottenham Hotspur.
Tuttomercatoweb reported this week that the former Lyon midfielder was set to leave Spurs this summer, amid speculation about joining Paris Saint-Germain on loan.
Bear in mind, this was after reports suggesting that Ndombele – who hasn’t played a minute in either of Tottenham’s games during Project Restart – was refusing to play for Jose Mourinho again.
But then Le10 Sport claimed that there’s no negotiations between him and PSG and, more significantly, no bust-up between the £63 million star and Mourinho.
Then again, actions speak louder than rumour and an update from Alasdair Gold doesn’t look good.
Speaking on his YouTube channel , the Football London journalist observed that Ndombele was the only player on Tottenham’s bench – apart from goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga – not to warm up once during the win over West Ham this week.
He said: “I noticed that every other single sub apart from Gazzaniga, during the match at some point, came and warmed up in front of us. I saw everyone, and because I hadn’t seen him [Ndombele] early on, it kind of became a bit of a thing.
“I was constantly watching to see if he ever did. And he didn’t. During the entire 90 minutes, Ndombele never came to warm up down the touchline. Now, I don’t know what that means.”
If we’re honest, this does look ominous and might tally of a rift between Ndombele and Mourinho. Then again, why would the Portuguese put him on the bench if there was a falling-out?
There’s a lot of moving parts in Ndombele’s situation in North London, but one thing you can’t deny is that all is not perfect, solely going by the fact he hasn’t played a minute of Premier League football since the return yet.
