One area of debate around Sessegnon has centered around what his best position is, with Tottenham signing the youngster – who scored 16 Championship goals during the 2017-18 campaign – as a left-sided attacker.
Alasdair Gold shares what he noticed about Ndombele on Spurs bench, looks bad
But Gold has revealed that Mourinho has told him that he views Sessegnon as a left-back with similar qualities as England legend Ashley Cole.
Gold wrote during a Q&A on Football London : “Mourinho likes him and wanted him at United. For now it’s about building him up & working on his defensive skills.
“Mourinho told me he sees him as a terrific future left-back, with similar traits to Ashley Cole, but he’s not ready yet. It’s telling that he looks to have bulked up during lockdown which will aid his development. I’d be surprised if he’s loaned out a year after being bought for £30m.”
It’s good news if Mourinho genuinely sees him as a left-back.
The Portuguese is a brilliant defensive coach and it’ll be fascinating to see how Sessegnon develops under the former Inter Milan and Chelsea boss.
