eMetals (EMT) has found new tungsten, niobium and rare earth element anomalies at its Nardoo Rare Metal Project in Western Australia.
The company completed a geochemical sampling program in May. Consequently, the program has successfully identified new anomalies.
At the Miru Prospect, tungsten was identified, with a peak tungsten trioxide stream sample value of 1090 parts per million.
Meanwhile, at the Cairn Hill prospect, neodymium oxide was identified with a soil sample value of 463 parts per million.
The results have indicated multiple drill targets, which the company will follow up as soon as possible.
eMetals Director Matthew Walker says these results are highly encouraging.
"Although the Miru Prospect appears the standout target with over two kilometres of highly anomalous strike length, inclusive of extraordinarily enriched tungsten values of up to 0.11 per cent tungsten trioxide in stream sediments, the anomalous rare earth neodymium identified at the newly discovered Cairn Hill prospect is also
of particular interest," he said.
Drilling is expected to commence within this current quarter.
On the market this morning, eMetals is up 109 per cent and is trading shares for 2.3 cents each at 10:19 am AEST.
