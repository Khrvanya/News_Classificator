TORONTO, Feb.  13, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (TSX: DPM)
Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial and Operating Highlights:
Record annual metals production – Strong fourth quarter performance from Chelopech and Ada Tepe delivered the highest production quarter of the year and contributed to record annual gold production of 230,592 ounces, above the mid-point of 2019 guidance. Copper production of 37.2 million pounds was also in line with 2019 guidance;
Improving performance at Tsumeb – Achieved throughput of 215,289 tonnes in line with its revised 2019 guidance, with a solid ramp-up to full production in the fourth quarter following an unplanned outage in the third quarter. Finalized new agreement such that smelter is now fully contracted for the next three years;
Increasing cash flows – Generated $52.9 million in cash flow from operating activities and $11.8 million of free cash flow(1) in the fourth quarter; generated annual year cash flow from operating activities of $99.4 million and increased free cash flow by 25% to $67.2 million;
Solid cost performance at all operations – Fourth quarter all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold(1) declined to $679; reported an all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold for 2019 of $725 and a cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted(1), of $421, both of which were in line with 2019 guidance and reflect continued focus on cost containment;
Initiation of three-year outlook – Longer term outlook provided, highlighting strong production profile of approximately 275,000 ounces of gold and 35 million pounds of copper per year, declining all-in sustaining costs, and the potential for significant cash flow generation;
Inaugural dividend – Introduction of a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share highlighting commitment to disciplined capital allocation and confidence in outlook;
Strong financial position and liquidity – Ended 2019 with approximately $188 million of cash resources, comprised of the undrawn portion of the Company’s long-term revolving credit facility (“RCF”), an increased cash position of $23.4 million and a reduced debt balance of $10.0 million; and
Growing adjusted net earnings – Reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter and for 2019 of $92.7 million and $70.9 million, respectively, as a result of a $107.0 million non-cash write-down. Reported adjusted net earnings(1) of $15.9 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year, reported adjusted net earnings increased by 18% to $34.3 million relative to 2018 with the declaration of commercial production at Ada Tepe.
“This was a pivotal year for DPM as we transition to a mid-tier producer. In 2019, we commenced production at our second gold mine, Ada Tepe, which delivered impressive performance following its commissioning in June. As a result, we generated record gold production and increased our free cash flow by approximately 25% year-over-year,” said Rick Howes, President and CEO. “We are forecasting another strong year for 2020 as we realize a full year of benefits from our two operating mines. In order to provide longer term visibility, we have initiated a three-year outlook that highlights our strong potential for significant cash flow generation from our portfolio.”
“Following a multi-year capital investment phase and highly successful optimization of our assets, we are also pleased to be in a position to reward our shareholders by declaring an inaugural quarterly dividend. This reflects our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our confidence that we will continue to deliver strong results in the coming years. Our intention is to establish a sustainable dividend based on our free cash flow outlook while maintaining sufficient capital to reinvest in our business.”
Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (“DPM” or the “Company”) today reported a fourth quarter net loss attributable to common shareholders of $92.7 million ($0.52 per share) compared to $1.3 million ($0.01 per share) for the same period in 2018. The net loss attributable to common shareholders in 2019 was $70.9 million ($0.40 per share) compared to net earnings attributable to common shareholders of $38.1 million ($0.21 per share) for the same period in 2018.
Net earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 and 2018 were impacted by several items not reflective of the Company’s underlying operating performance, most notably an impairment charge in respect of Tsumeb in 2019 as well as unrealized gains on commodity price hedges that, prior to the adoption of IFRS 9 in 2018, did not receive hedge accounting treatment and net gains and losses on Sabina Gold and Silver Corp. (“Sabina”) special warrants, which are excluded from adjusted net earnings (loss)(1).
Adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 were $15.9 million ($0.09 per share) and $34.3 million ($0.19 per share), respectively, compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.1 million ($0.02 per share) and adjusted net earnings of $29.0 million ($0.16 per share) for the corresponding periods in 2018. These increases were due primarily to the start-up of Ada Tepe, which achieved commercial production in June 2019, higher realized gold prices and a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and ZAR, partially offset by lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb.
As at December 31, 2019, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of Tsumeb, triggered by the timing of the anticipated expansion project being delayed and the ability to optimize the mix of feed being processed by the smelter.
As a result of this assessment, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $107.0 million. This charge is primarily attributable to the increased opportunity to process additional volumes of third party complex concentrate at Tsumeb by capitalizing on, from time to time, market demand to process Chelopech concentrate, which has more available outlets than other complex third party concentrate processed by Tsumeb. While this has the potential to generate additional overall value for the Company, this would be realized through lower treatment charges and higher margins at Chelopech rather than higher throughput and higher margins at Tsumeb. The ability to optimize mix, as well as the actual timing and volume of expected additional third party complex concentrate coming to market, could also result in Tsumeb’s expansion being further delayed and possibly deferred indefinitely if a long term contract cannot be secured to support the expansion to 370,000 tonnes. At present, the outlook for additional third party complex concentrate coming to market remains favourable as is the prospect for entering into a long-term arrangement. In 2019, the Company contracted additional supply under its tolling agreement with IXM S.A., on terms in line with existing arrangements, such that the smelter’s existing capacity is now fully contracted for the next three years. In addition, the Government of Namibia recently issued an Environmental Clearance Certificate to the Company, which provides the approval required to move forward with the expansion.
Adjusted EBITDA(1) in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 was $55.0 million and $138.2 million, respectively, compared to $12.5 million and $99.5 million in the corresponding periods in 2018, reflecting the same factors that affected adjusted net earnings (loss), except for depreciation, interest and income taxes, which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, gold contained in concentrate produced increased by 52% to 69,491 ounces, including 26,528 ounces from Ada Tepe, which achieved full design capacity in the third quarter of 2019, and copper production increased by 17% to 10.0 million pounds due primarily to higher copper grades and recoveries at Chelopech, in each case, relative to the corresponding period in 2018.
In 2019, gold contained in concentrate produced increased by 15% to 230,592 ounces, including 57,193 ounces from Ada Tepe, and copper production increased by 2% to 37.2 million pounds, in each case, relative to 2018. The increase in gold production was due primarily to the start of commercial production at Ada Tepe in June 2019, partially offset by lower gold grades and recoveries at Chelopech, in line with its 2019 mine plan.
Complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb during the fourth quarter of 2019 of 48,614 tonnes was 23% lower than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to the timing of the Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown that occurred in the fourth quarter in 2019 versus the third quarter in 2018.
Complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb during 2019 of 215,289 tonnes was 7% lower than 2018 due primarily to the pressurization event in the Ausmelt offgas system that occurred in September 2019 during a restart after routine maintenance. Repairs to the damaged offgas system components were completed over a 14-day period and during the restart of the facility, it was determined that the initial pressurization event had also caused damage to the lining of the furnace. This resulted in advancing the Ausmelt furnace reline, baghouse and ducting maintenance originally planned for October 2019 to September 2019. This work was completed over a 38-day period, 10 days longer than planned, due primarily to delays in receiving materials. The next Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown is currently scheduled for 2021, based on an expected operating cycle of 18 to 24 months.
Payable gold in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased by 136% to 79,109 ounces relative to the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to gold production from Ada Tepe, the timing of concentrate deliveries and a drawdown of concentrate inventories at Chelopech and Ada Tepe. Payable copper in concentrate sold in the fourth quarter of 2019 of 11.0 million pounds was 56% higher than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to higher deliveries of gold-copper concentrate as a result of the timing of concentrate deliveries and a drawdown of concentrate inventories at Chelopech.
In 2019, payable gold in concentrate sold increased by 21% to 198,664 ounces relative to 2018 due primarily to the start of commercial production at Ada Tepe in June 2019, partially offset by lower gold grades at Chelopech. In 2019, payable copper in concentrate sold of 34.1 million pounds was comparable to 2018.
Cost of sales in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 of $98.2 million and $306.4 million, respectively, was $32.5 million and $33.5 million higher than the corresponding periods in 2018 due primarily to higher depreciation and gold concentrate deliveries at Ada Tepe following the commencement of production in June 2019, partially offset by the favourable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR and Euro.
All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in the fourth quarter of 2019 of $679 was $185 lower than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to deliveries of low-cost gold produced at Ada Tepe, following the achievement of full design capacity in the third quarter of 2019.
All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in 2019 of $725 was $65 higher than 2018 due primarily to lower gold grades in gold-copper concentrate produced at Chelopech and higher cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures, in line with 2019 guidance, partially offset by deliveries of low-cost gold produced at Ada Tepe in 2019.
Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb during the fourth quarter of 2019 of $465 was $52 higher than the corresponding period in 2018 due primarily to lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted stemming from the timing of the Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown, partially offset by the favourable impact of a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar.
Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb during 2019 of $421 was $24 lower than 2018 due primarily to the favourable impact of a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted.
Cash provided from operating activities in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 was $52.9 million and $99.4 million, respectively, compared to $32.7 million and $98.1 million in the corresponding periods in 2018 reflecting the same underlying factors affecting net earnings (loss), except for depreciation, any impairment charges or reversals thereof, and changes in working capital. In addition, during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019, Ada Tepe delivered 12,123 ounces of gold pursuant to the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement resulting in $16.5 million of deferred revenue being recognized in revenue with no corresponding impact on cash as these deliveries were in partial satisfaction of the $50.0 million of upfront proceeds received in 2016 in respect of the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement.
Free cash flow in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 was $11.8 million and $67.2 million, respectively, compared to negative cash flow of $4.3 million and free cash flow of $53.9 million in the corresponding periods in 2018. Free cash flow was impacted by the same factors affecting cash provided from operating activities, with the exception of changes in working capital, which are excluded from free cash flow, and outlays for sustaining capital, lease obligations and interest, which are included in free cash flow.
Capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 were $20.1 million and $73.8 million, respectively, compared to $23.6 million and $107.4 million in the corresponding periods in 2018.
Growth capital expenditures(1) incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 were $1.5 million and $36.5 million, respectively, compared to $14.1 million and $80.0 million in the corresponding periods in 2018. The period over period decline in growth capital expenditures was related principally to the construction of the Ada Tepe gold mine. Sustaining capital expenditures(1) incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2019 were $18.6 million and $37.3 million, respectively, compared to $9.5 million and $27.4 million in the corresponding periods in 2018 and were in line with 2019 guidance. Fourth quarter changes were due primarily to the timing of executing planned projects and the timing of the Ausmelt maintenance shutdown. The increase in 2019 sustaining capital expenditures was in line with 2019 guidance and reflected higher spending, as planned, for the work being done at Chelopech to extend the life of its tailings management facility.
The Company filed a National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101’”) Technical Report on August 29, 2019 supporting the preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) of the Timok gold project. The PEA is based on the updated Mineral Resource estimate completed in September 2018 and provides a base case which, primarily considers the oxide and transitional material types. Following optimization work completed in 2019 to incorporate the sulphide portion of the resource, geotechnical work is currently underway prior to initiating a potential prefeasibility study. If approved, the prefeasibility study would be initiated in the first half of 2020. For additional details, refer to the press releases entitled “Dundee Precious Metals Files NI 43-101 Technical Report Supporting the Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Timok Gold Project in Serbia” dated August 29, 2019 and “NI 43-101 Technical Report – Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Timok Gold Project Serbia” dated November 7, 2018, both found on DPM’s website and filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .
At Chelopech, diamond drilling continued in the fourth quarter of 2019 from underground positions along the Southeast Breccia Pipe Zone and from surface at the Wedge South target and at the Krasta prospect. Results from the first two holes at the Wedge South target are encouraging and further drilling is in progress. At Ada Tepe, drilling continued during the fourth quarter of 2019 on the concession and exploration licenses near the mine. In Serbia, drilling in the fourth quarter of 2019 focused on shallow oxide targets at the Timok gold project as well as extensions of higher grade copper gold porphyry mineralization at depth at the Tulare project. In Quebec, mapping and prospecting in the second half of 2019 have defined new drill targets on the Malartic project.
As at December 31, 2019, DPM had $23.4 million of cash, $59.4 million of investments, comprised primarily of its 10.4% interest in Sabina and 19.5% equity interest in INV Metals Inc. (“INV”), and $165.0 million of undrawn capacity under its RCF. With the start-up of Ada Tepe and the corresponding expected increase in operating cash flow, the Company amended the terms and size of its RCF, resulting in, among other things, the cancellation of tranches A and C in April 2019 and the increase of tranche B from $150 million to $175 million in June 2019.
DPM announced that its Board of Directors has approved the introduction of a regular dividend and declared an inaugural quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common share. This dividend is payable on April 15, 2020 to shareholders of record as at 5:00 p.m. Toronto local time on March  31, 2020 and qualifies as an "eligible dividend" for Canadian income tax purposes. Dividends paid to shareholders outside of Canada (non-resident investors) will be subject to Canadian non-resident withholding taxes. For Canadian shareholders, the U.S. dollar dividend will be converted to Canadian dollars using the spot exchange rate on April 14, 2020, the date prior to the payment date.
The level of this dividend was set with the intention of establishing a sustainable dividend based on the Company’s free cash flow outlook and is expected to allow the Company to build additional balance sheet strength to support further growth, a key element of DPM’s strategy. With strong free cash flow expected from the business in the coming years based on the current market environment, the Company will consider increasing its regular dividend and/or, from time to time, declaring a supplemental dividend.
The declaration, amount and timing of any future dividend is at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be assessed based on the Company’s capital allocation framework, having regard for the Company’s financial position, overall market conditions, its outlook for sustainable free cash flow and capital, and other factors considered relevant by the Board of Directors. Based on the Company's current financial position and outlook, the Board of Directors expects to declare future quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.02 per common share. Subject to authorization by the Board of Directors and compliance with all applicable laws, the record date for future dividends is expected to be the last business day of March, June, September and December in each year and the payment date is expected to be approximately two weeks thereafter. The exact record date and other details of future dividends, if any, will be announced by the Company separately at such time a dividend is declared and authorized by the Board of Directors.
The Company intends to initiate an NCIB to purchase up to 9,000,000 common shares of the Company (“Shares”) on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”). The NCIB has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, however, it is subject to acceptance by the TSX and, if accepted, will be made in accordance with the applicable rules and policies of the TSX and applicable Canadian securities laws.
Pursuant to the NCIB, it is expected that the Company will be able to purchase up to 9,000,000 Shares, representing 5% of the total outstanding Shares as of February 13, 2020, over a period of twelve months commencing after TSX approval. In accordance with TSX rules, any daily purchases, other than pursuant to a block purchase exception, on the TSX under the NCIB will be limited to a maximum 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the six months ended January 31, 2020. The price that the Company will pay for Shares in open market transactions will be the market price at the time of purchase and any Shares that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled. The actual timing and number of Shares that may be purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be subject to DPM’s ongoing capital requirements and management’s view that, from time to time, DPM’s Shares trade at prices well below the underlying value of the Company and during these periods the repurchase of Shares represents an excellent opportunity to enhance shareholder value.
The Company commenced an NCIB on May 16, 2018 (the “Previous Bid”), which expired on May 15, 2019. Under the Previous Bid, the Company sought and obtained approval to purchase up to 8,900,000 Shares but did not purchase any Shares under the Previous Bid as it continued to fund the development of its Ada Tepe mine in Bulgaria.
