At the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the fundamental case for gold stocks made tremendous sense, even if the technicals weren’t in sync. Although we’ve witnessed many fear-driven events over the past few decades, arguably none were as frightening as this crisis. Nothing chills to the bone quite like an invisible killer.
For a month or so after the coronavirus shuttered the U.S. economy, gold stocks became much more intuitive. Not only did the argument make sense but other investors piled in, driving up prices for both the metal and the broader mining complex. After years of frustration, it appeared that gold bugs would finally have their day in the sun.
Alas, it was not to be. In recent weeks, two major announcements shifted investor sentiment back toward a more risk-on profile. First, the May jobs report indicated that the economy added 2.5 million jobs, repudiating the calls for doom and gloom. Second, the Commerce Department released its U.S. retail sales report , which showed nearly an 18% increase from April to May.
Without consumer fears, the case for gold stocks to buy was poised to fade away. However, investors shouldn’t be too quick to abandon the metals market. Primarily, initial weekly jobless claims continue to number in the millions, suggesting that our economy still has a long way to go. Additionally, coronavirus hot spots have sprouted in Florida and Texas , raising alarms about a possible second wave.
To protect yourself against the unknown, investors should consider these gold stocks, which are broken down into investing-style categories: streaming and royalty companies, fiscally stable firms, value plays, and — my personal favorite — speculative bets.
