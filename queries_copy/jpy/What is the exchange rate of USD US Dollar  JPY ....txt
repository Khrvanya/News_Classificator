Forex trades are always made using currency pairs. Whenever you buy one currency you are selling another. In every pair there is a base currency, for example USD (US Dollar) and a quote currency, which would be JPY (Japanese Yen).
The price of a currency pair represents the amount of quote currency, or JPY (Japanese Yen), that you will need to spend in order to purchase a single unit of USD (US Dollar), the base currency. So using the current example you would need to spend 107.514028 of JPY (Japanese Yen) in order to purchase 1 USD (US Dollar).
Forex pairs fall into three categories; the majors, the commodity currencies, and the cross currencies:
Major currencies represent the most commonly traded currencies on the market. Different brokers will use different criteria, but almost all lists will include EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF
Commodity currencies are currency pairs whose price is closely tied to commodities such as oil, iron ore, and coal. Commonly cited examples are AUD/USD and USD/CAD
Cross currencies are all currency pairs that don’t include USD. Examples include EUR/GBP and EUR/JPY.
