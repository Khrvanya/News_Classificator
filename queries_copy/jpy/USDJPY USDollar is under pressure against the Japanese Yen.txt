The U.S. dollar is under pressure after breaking out at 107.490 and reaching 108.865. The pair has been drifting downwards since the 18th October after failing its second attempt to crossover 108.865 resistance.
The U.S. dollar is now trading in a downwards price channel at 108.562 from the time of writing and could continue down to 108.340 support if it maintains its current trend. A breakdown below 108.340 could reverse the trend and potentially push prices further down to 108.00 and 107.750
