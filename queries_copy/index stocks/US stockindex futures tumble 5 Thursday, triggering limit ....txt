U.S. stocks have been experiencing some of the most volatile trading in the past decade in recent weeks and that trend continued into Thursday morning as the three main stock-index futures contracts hit 5% limit-down rules for the second time this week.
Futures for the most-active Dow Jones Industrial Average US:YMH20 for March were down 5.22%, or 1,231 points, to 22,344 at their intrasession low Thursday, while S&P 500 futures US:ESH20 fell 5.08% to reach 2,601. Nasdaq-100 futures US:NQH20 declined 5.02% to 7,601.50.
Futures have plunged overnight setting up for another ugly decline for stocks Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s address to the nation Wednesday night at 9 p.m. Eastern, where he announced a month long ban on travel from Europe to the U.S. for foreign nationals, but failed to assuage fears about the spread of COVID-19, the infectious disease that has infected nearly 128,000 people , including recently celebrities like actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson .
The U.S. stock futures volatility limit, which was also hit on Monday, is triggered when stock-index futures see a 5% swing in either direction during premarket or after-hours trading, outside U.S.’s 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time to 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading period, according to the CME Group’s website .
When stock futures hit such levels, known as “limit up and limit down,” they aren’t allowed to move any higher or lower. Equity-index futures have different rules than other futures contracts.
On Monday, stock-index futures hit the daily downside limit that pinned their declines at 5% ahead of a brutal selloff sparked by a punishing slide in crude-oil prices CL00,
and worries about the spread of COVID-19.
