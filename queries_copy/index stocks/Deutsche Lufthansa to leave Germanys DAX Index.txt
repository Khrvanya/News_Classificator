Deutsche Lufthansa AG will leave Germany's DAX index as of June 22, a move that comes after the coronavirus pandemic and related travel restrictions dealt a hard blow to the company.
The German flag carrier, whose supervisory board recently approved a state-aid package worth 9 billion euros ($10.14 billion), will move into the MDAX index, stock-exchange operator Deutsche Boerse AG said late Thursday.
German real-estate company Deutsche Wohnen SE will move into the DAX to replace Lufthansa's shares, it said.
