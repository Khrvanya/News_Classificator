Atlantia, an infrastructure group, announced that it swung to a 1Q net loss of 10 million euros from a net profit of 157 million euros in the prior-year period, citing impact of Covid-19 pandemic on its motorway and airport operators. EBIT dropped 37% on year to 352 million euros on operating revenue of 2.21 billion euros, down 15%. The company added: "Considering the traffic figures up to this point and assuming a gradual recovery from the second half of 2020 onwards, a preliminary sensitivity analysis results in an estimated average annual decline in the Group's motorway traffic of approximately 30% and in airport traffic of approximately 50%. This would result in a potential reduction in the Group's revenue of around E3bn compared with the figure for 2019."
DSV Panalpina, a logistic group, was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs.
