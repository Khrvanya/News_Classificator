Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx and the Bash Street Kids – characters from the popular Beano comics – will soon be teaching primary school children about money.
Beano for Schools is a new primary school teaching resource on money and financial wellbeing, brought to us by the Bank of England, Beano and Tes, formerly known as the Times Educational Supplement, a weekly UK publication aimed at education professionals.
It will be included in the Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) curriculum.
The website, which can be previewed here , has a set of 12 lessons about Money and Me where the Beano gang will educate youngsters between 5 and 11 about the basics of how money and the economy work. It launches in July. Teachers can sign up now to register their interest in the free resource.
To mark My Money Week, the Bank of England announced the collaboration. Andrew Bailey, its governor, said:
Financial literacy is essential for everyone. The Bank’s education programme is central to our role in equipping the public with sufficient financial and economic knowledge for their daily lives. We are delighted to partner with Beano and Tes on the new Money and Me resource, which will take our programme into primary schools. It will support teachers in giving young people a strong sense of the importance of economic and financial decisions from an early age.
Emma Scott, chief executive of Beano Studios, says:
Beano has been engaging children for more than 80 years, and we love bringing that experience to the classroom. Our Beano for Schools programme translates complex topics into entertaining and engaging content for both kids and teachers and we’ve had fun producing these unique financial literacy lessons so kids can enjoy learning about money and gain necessary life skills.
