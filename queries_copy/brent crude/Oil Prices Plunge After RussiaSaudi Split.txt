Crude prices logged their worst day since the financial crisis after two of the world’s biggest oil producers failed to agree on whether to reduce global supply in the face of the coronavirus’s devastating effect on demand.
On Friday, Brent crude, the global benchmark, notched its largest one-day percentage decline since December of 2008, falling 9.4% to $45.27. U.S. crude futures declined 10.1% to $41.28 a barrel, their largest one-day percentage decline since November of 2014.
