For the past few years the North Sea has been adapting to an oil price of about $60 a barrel.
Prof Kemp said, at the lowest figure of $25, 35% of available oil and gas could be uneconomic to drill.
And even at the higher price of $45, it was calculated that 28% could be left where it is.
The report, compiled with colleague Linda Stephen, states: "This study uses costs as before the effects of the Covid-19 crisis were fully understood.
"Given the current restrictions on travel and the social distancing rules it is likely that some costs will increase.
Industry body Oil and Gas UK recently warned that 30,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the low oil price.
The industry fears the problems will last much longer than the Covid-19 pandemic, and that has meant many workers are being laid off rather than furloughed.
Ross Dornan, OGUK's market intelligence manager, said of the new report: "We know that low oil and gas prices, along with the impact of Covid-19 on operations, have created a very uncertain outlook."
Ryan Morrison, a "just transition" campaigner with Friends of the Earth, called for a "managed phase out" of fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis.
"The impacts of this approach are already being felt hard by the workforce with huge and devastating implications for livelihoods and surrounding communities particularly in the north east of Scotland," he added.
