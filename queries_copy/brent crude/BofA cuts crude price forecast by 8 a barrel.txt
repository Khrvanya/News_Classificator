Strategists at the Bank of America’s Global Commodity Research have changed their 2020 forecast for crude oil prices by $8 a barrel , due to the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy.
According to a note sent to Kallanish Energy on Monday, BofA now estimates Brent crude to average $54/Bbl, down from a previous forecast of $62/Bbl. The lowest level will likely to be seen in the second quarter at $48/Bbl, before it peaks at $58/Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2020.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices are forecast to average $49/Bbl this year, also varying around $10 between its lowest and highest estimates. Strategists believe the U.S. crude benchmark will reach $43/Bbl in Q2 and $53/Bbl in Q4.
The cuts reflect fading GDP (gross domestic product) growth expectations. However, they added the silver lining is that Opec+ will likely cut output this week, while U.S. oil supply growth could fall to just 500,000 Bpd year-on-year in 2020.
Fear over the coronavirus impact on crude demand and global economy growth has led to an agressive markets sell-off last week, with Brent crude futures down nearly 14%, opening on Monday at $48.95/Bbl. (See related story)
