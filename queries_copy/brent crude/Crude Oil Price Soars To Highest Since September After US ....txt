Brent crude futures jumped by close to $3 on Friday to their highest since September after a US air strike killed key Iranian and Iraqi military personnel, raising concerns that escalating Middle East tensions may disrupt oil supplies.Â Brent crude futures jumped nearly $3 to hit a high of $69.16 a barrel, the highest since September 17. The front-month Brent March contract was at $68.25 a barrel, up $2.00, or 3 per cent, by 0258 GMT (8:28 am in India).
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.76, or 2.9 per cent, to $62.94 a barrel. Earlier, it touched $63.84 a barrel, highest since May 1.
"The supply side risks remain elevated in the Middle East and we could see tensions continue to elevate between the US and Iran-backed militia in Iraq," said Edward Moya, analyst at brokerage OANDA, in an e-mail to news agency Reuters.
An air strike at the Baghdad International Airport early on Friday killed Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force, and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi militia spokesman told Reuters.
The Pentagon later confirmed it was a US air strike that killed Soleimani.
