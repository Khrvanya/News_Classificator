UPDATED: The price of a barrel of Norway’s North Sea crude oil crashed to its lowest level since 1999 this week, falling even further to below USD 17 a barrel early Wednesday. The country’s currency weakened again on the news, as debate swirls over proposals to offer crisis aid to the oil industry amidst market chaos.
Not even Norway’s huge new Johan Sverdrup oil installation can turn a profit at an oil price below USD 20 a barrel. Sverdrup is expected to produce 2.7 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents over the next 50 years, but demand for oil has recently dried up. PHOTO: Equinor/Ole Jørgen Bratland
Oil prices fell to as low as USD 19.01 in morning trading, then even lower until reviving on Wednesday. By late afternoon in Oslo, North Sea Brent crude was trading back up at USD 21.48 but the market was described as “out of control.”
Meanwhile it cost NOK 10.71 to buy one US dollar on Wednesday afternoon. Norway’s currency is always tied to the value of its most important export product, so with oil trading at just a third of its value earlier this year, the krone has been battered as well.
