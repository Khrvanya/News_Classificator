Be stock specific for time being: Shrikant Chouhan
“Indian equities mirrored the global markets rally and closed substantially higher. US futures also traded higher on the back of fresh prospects of an expansion of economic stimulus. Nifty closed above the level of 10750 under the leadership of financials and Reliance Industries. Our markets are receiving every day one or the other booster dose of positive news flow, which has been keeping the bullish trend intact. However, the Nifty is leaving un-filled price gaps that would cause negatively in the near term. Be stock specific for the time being and buy Nifty if it corrects to support levels. Support for Nifty exists at 10700 and 10650,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities.
Traders should maintain focus on stock selection: Ajit Mishra
"Apart from the global cues, the beginning of the Q1FY21 earnings season and macroeconomic data viz. IIP and CPI data will be the focus ahead. We believe more than earnings, management commentary will be crucial for the market participants, to get a sense of the virus impact over the businesses. Nifty has surpassed the immediate hurdle at 10,750 and now 10,950 is the next critical resistance. Traders should maintain their focus on stock selection and trade management," said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking
Nifty's immediate hurdle at 10,887: Mazhar Mohammad
For now, there are no apparent sell signals on charts, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in, who however felt that the recent intraday narrow ranges on Nifty50 can still be construed as weakening momentum. "The immediate hurdle for the index seems to be its 200-day simple moving average, whose value is placed around 10,887. A weakness may get confirmed with a close below 10695 level," Mohammad said.
Easing of India-China tensions boosted investors’ sentiments: Ajit Mishra
"Markets made a promising start largely led by supportive global cues and gained over one and a half percent.

The rally was broad-based as both midcap and smallcap indices ended with healthy gains. On the sector front, apart from FMCG, healthcare and telecom, which ended in losses, all the other sectoral indices supported the rally wherein energy, metals, auto and realty were the top gainers," said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking
