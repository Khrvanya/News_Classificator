A day after hitting the highest level since 2012, gold prices slid Wednesday amid growing fears of a second wave of infections swamping the US and some other economies such as India and Brazil.
The World Health Organisation pointed to rising cases of coronavirus in the US, China, Latin America as reigniting worries of a possible second wave of the epidemic.
Those fears saw a rise in the value of the US dollar, which in turn knocked commodity prices lower. The Aussie dollar fell back under 69 US cents to trade at 68.80 US cents at 6 am.
The slide in share prices on Wall Street added to the downward pressures on commodities. Oil fell more than 6% as well.
