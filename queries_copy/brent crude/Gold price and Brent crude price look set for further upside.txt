Gold and Brent crude both look set for further upside, with key resistance levels broken.

Gold is weakening in the wake of a failed attempt to break through the $1745 resistance level. Given the previous rise through $1740 resistance, this looks to be the beginning of a resurgence for the precious metal.
However, the fall back into $1727 support points towards the possibility of a short-term pullback. Should that occur, there is a chance we could see the price of gold fall back in the short term. Whether we see that retracement of the $1694-$1745 rally will depend on whether we break below $1727 Â­or not. Either way, this current weakness is likely to be a short-term phenomenon and precursor to further upside. As such, a bullish outlook is in play, with a rise back into the $1765 peak likely before long.
Brent crude is currently trading at the highest level since 11 March, with the recent rise through $38.23 providing us with another period of consolidation overnight.
This is a likely precursor to further upside, with the short-term uptrend likely to continue until we see the price break below the previous swing low. As things stand, a break below $37.19 would be required to negate this bullish trend. Until then, further upside seems likely for Brent.
