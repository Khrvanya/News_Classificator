August/September CP propane swaps narrowed to a notional backwardation of $1/mt, compared with a $2/mt backwardation on July 3, reflecting a bullish expectation for Q4 in anticipation of a recovery in Indian demand following the gradually drawdown of inventory, which is likely to boost imports from the Middle East.
** Propane demand from Asian steam crackers is expected to remain supported by partially switching to LPG as feedstock through July, as the downstream ethylene market outperforms the aromatics -- making LPG more attractive -- as LPG yields more ethylene and propylene as compared with naphtha, which yields more aromatics.
** Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. is due to announce acceptances of term nominations for August-loading cargoes later this week, with no cancellations or major delays expected. ADNOC, had announced acceptances of term LPG nominations for July loading without cuts or delays after term lifters reduced nominated volumes from usual levels.

**This week, eyes will also be on negotiations surrounding state-run Pertamina's 88 RON gasoline term tender. Offers are due for submission on July 6, and will cover term deliveries from August to December. Since March, Pertamina, the region's largest buyer of gasoline, has kept import volumes low due to the coronavirus pandemic, having even to defer some previously bought cargoes. Should Pertamina show signs of a pick-up in import volumes, sentiment in the Asian gasoline complex is likely to turn positive, sources said.
