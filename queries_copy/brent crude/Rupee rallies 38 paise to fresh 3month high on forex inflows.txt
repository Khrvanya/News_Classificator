Mumbai: The rupee jumped by 38 paise to settle at more than three-month high of 74.66 against the US dollar on Friday tracking weakness in the greenback and gains in domestic equities amid optimism over potential COVID-19 vaccine.
Forex traders said investors were bullish on emerging market assets following encouraging vaccine test results and positive US jobs data. Moreover, gains in equities, steady crude oil prices and weak US currency supported the local unit.
The rupee opened at 74.60, and settled for the day at 74.66 against the US dollar, registering a jump of 38 paise over its previous close and the highest closing level since March 17.
It had settled at 75.04 against the greenback on Thursday.
During the four-hour trading session, the rupee witnessed an intra-day high of 74.60 and a low of 75.02.
A potential COVID-19 vaccine indigenously developed by the Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila Healthcare has got approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for human clinical trials.
The approval process was fast-tracked following recommendation by the subject expert committee on COVID-19, considering the emergency and unmet medical need during the pandemic.
The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.11 per cent to 97.20.
On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex settled 177.72 points, or 0.50 per cent, higher at 36,021.42. The NSE Nifty rose 55.65 points, or 0.53 per cent, to end at 10,607.35.
Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market as they sold shares worth Rs 556.72 crore on Thursday, according to provisional exchange data.
Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.11 per cent to USD 42.66 per barrel. Meanwhile, the number of cases around the world linked to COVID-19 has crossed 1.08 crore and the death toll has topped 5.20 lakh. In India, the death toll due the disease rose to 18,213 and the number of infections spiked to 6,25,544, according to the health ministry.
On a weekly basis, the rupee advanced by 99 paise. It had settled at 75.65 against the US dollar on June 26.
"Rupee hit a three-month high after breaking out of a tight trading band, boosted by strong inflows and expectations that the central bank may be slowing its purchases of dollars," Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities said.
"Strength in domestic equity market on hope vaccine before August 15 and foreign fund inflows in domestic market supported rupee. Overseas funds infused USD 4.2 billion into Indian stocks in the June quarter, the highest in Asia," Vakil said adding that the investment arm of Intel Corp on Friday agreed to pay Rs 1,894.5 crore for a slice of Jio.
Going ahead, the speed of rise may get arrested though momentum is clearly towards further appreciation to 74.20 to 74, Vakil added.
According to Sugandha Sachdeva, VP-Metals, Energy & Currency Research, Religare Broking, "the bias for the rupee has shifted towards appreciation, given the risk-on environment and significant flows in the market, and as strong data sets from the US have weighed on the dollar."
Sachdeva further said that, "We believe the RBI will step in at regular intervals, and will not be comfortable to see the rupee appreciate beyond the 73.90 to 74.00 band. We expect rupee to trade in the 74.00 to 75.60 band in the near-term."
"The spot was holding the psychological support of 75, however, it broke mainly due to the dollar inflows likely on account of Reliance Jio, and hopes of a V-shape recovery in the global growth," said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.
Gupta further said that "all this while, RBI was intervening and sucking out all the dollar inflows, and it may continue doing so. The year long US-China trade war is reigniting and will put some pressure over the safe-haven demand for dollar in Asian trade."
The Financial Benchmark India Private Ltd (FBIL) set the reference rate for the rupee/dollar at 75.4876 and for rupee/euro at 85.0695. The reference rate for rupee/British pound was fixed at 94.3610 and for rupee/100 Japanese yen at 70.24.
