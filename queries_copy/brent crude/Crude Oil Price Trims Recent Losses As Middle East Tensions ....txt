Crude oil prices are now a little down on prices before the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani that sparked the crisis.
Crude oil prices rose on Thursday, recouping some of the heavy losses from the previous session as the market rebalanced after Washington and Tehran looked to defuse a potential Middle East crisis.
Prices had soared in response to the killing of an Iranian general in an American air strike last week and Iran's retaliatory attack on US forces in Iraq on Wednesday, before diving more than 4 per cent when the two countries quickly ratcheted back tensions, hitting a three-week low.
Brent crude futures - the global benchmark for crude oil - rose by 55 cents, or 0.8 per cent, to $65.99 a barrel by 0109 GMT (6:39 am in India) after tumbling 4.1 per cent on Wednesday. They are now a little down on prices before the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani that sparked the crisis.
US oil added 61 cents, or 1 per cent, to $60.22 after falling nearly 5 per cent in the previous session.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday dialled back on days of threatening commentary and said Iran was "standing down" after the missile attacks that left no casualties, with Tehran say the strikes "concluded" its response to the Soleimani killing.
