Speaking to Edinburgh Live, he said: "We're doing some different as we'll be the only permanent drive-thru.
The drive-in will operate throughout the week, with two films each night - an earlier kids showing and a later viewing for adults.
On Friday and Saturday nights, there will also be a special late night showings for brave viewers with horror films, while Ally also has plans for fun-filled musical nights, featuring the likes of Mamma Mia.
The movie sound will be transmitted straight to your car radio and viewers will be able to order their favourite cinema treats beforehand - including popcorn and hot dogs -Â  from the snack van, which will be delivered straight to your car on the night.

Ally explains that he wants to make the event as accessible as possible and is looking to reach out to businesses to donate a designated car for the drive-in which can be used by families and others who don't own a vehicle, adding that they will also be supporting local charities.
In announcement on Facebook he said: "We have just done the deal and proud to announce that we will be operating from The Corn Exchange in Edinburgh from September 1st.
"We will be putting the film schedule up and ticket info before the Weekend. We will be the only permanent drive-in throughout Scotland."
