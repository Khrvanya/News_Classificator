BRASILIA, BRAZIL — Brazil is forecast to produce a second straight record corn crop in 2019-20, matching last year’s mark of 101 million tonnes, according to a Jan. 9 Global Agricultural Information Network report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The USDA said this year’s unchanged output is based on expectations of expanded area paired with a return to normal trend yields.
Corn exports in 2018-19 are estimated at a record 37 million tonnes, almost 50% higher than the previous season as a result of the much larger harvest, which was 23% higher than in 2017-18.
The USDA’s 2019-20 corn export forecast for Brazil projects an 8% decline to 34 million tonnes.
Total corn area is estimated at 17.5 million hectares, a 5% increase over 2017-18, according to the USDA.
According to data from Brazil’s agricultural statistics agency, CONAB, almost every Brazilian state that grows second-crop corn saw expanded area, improved yields and double-digit percent growth of production volumes in 2018-19.
“Brazil is expected to increase domestic consumption in the upcoming marketing year as the livestock industry expands to meet Chinese demand and the burgeoning corn ethanol industry continues to grow,” the USDA said.
Brazil is the world’s third-ranked corn producer behind the United States and China and the second-ranked exporter behind the United States.
