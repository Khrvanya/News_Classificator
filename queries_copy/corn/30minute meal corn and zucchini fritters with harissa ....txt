Jackie Middleton’s corn and zucchini fritters with harissa cauliflower steak.
Before the constant rotation of glossy cookbooks and the ease of internet searches, “core recipes” were tried and true staples that a cook would know intuitively, build on, develop and share with friends.
A simple batter is one of these core recipes – it can be tweaked for savoury or sweet applications, used pan-fried, deep fried or baked. I like recipes that are predictable, solid and dependable, and this basic savoury batter is all three.
I use the batter, spiced slightly, for these pan-fried sweetcorn and zucchini fritters. I’ve also deep fried this mixture and baked it in little muffin moulds to create canapés too. It just seems to work, as I need, whatever the application I’m chasing: a light plant-based dinner, a fancy breakfast, finger food to share, a wholesome burger patty alternative.
You can also experiment with the batter to make it suit your needs. To make it gluten-free, substitute gluten-free flour for the plain flour. For a vegan version, use almond or soy milk and make a “chia egg” instead of using hen eggs. Chia eggs are 15g of chia seeds mixed with 50ml of warm water, and they can be substituted for one hen egg in most recipes that don’t need to rise.
I’ve given a nod to Morocco with these flavour combinations, with the backbone of some heat courtesy of red harissa paste. Spiced up or not, these fritters are an absolute star.
