Vicki Maertz and her helpers Kennedy Henson, 7, and son Derik, 8, serve up freshly-cooked sweet corn at Chuck Siebrasse Corn Boil at CornFest Saturday August 24 in downtown DeKalb.
DeKALB â€“ Seems like even the COVID-19 pandemic might not be enough to stop DeKalb County residents from flocking downtown for some sweet corn and festival fun this summer.
The 43rd Annual DeKalb Corn Festival remains set for Aug. 28 through 30 at the end of the summer, pending restrictions regarding large gatherings and public health amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The popular family-friendly festival typically sees thousands make their way to downtown DeKalb over the weekend event, which features food stands, live music, festival rides and, of course, lots of corn.
"Corn Fest will be held this year, Aug 28-30th, which is at the end of the summer season," said Lisa Angel, festival chairwoman Friday. "At this time, we are going ahead as planned but we have contingencies in place that if we need to cancel we will. Our community safety always comes first."
The DeKalb City Council is also set to vote next on annual road closure plans for Corn Fest, and will take up two resolutions to close portions of Route 38 from First to Fourth Streets, along with authorizing a special event agreement for the festival during its meeting set for Tuesday at 6 p.m., moved from Monday due to the holiday.
The event is significant in DeKalb County both for tourist attraction and the revenue it brings to subsequent hospitality and tourism businesses. Portions of proceeds from ticket sales are donated to a different local nonprofit each year.
