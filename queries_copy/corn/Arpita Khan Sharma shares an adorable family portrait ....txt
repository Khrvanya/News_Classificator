Arpita Khan Sharma and Aayush were stationed at Salman Khan ’s Panvel farmhouse during lockdown, but they later returned to the city. And now the couple has been spending time with Aayush’s family in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. Arpita posted an adorable family portrait, celebrating her father-in-law’s birthday. This priceless memory also captured Arpita and Aayush’s munchkins Ahil and Ayaat.
Aayush had shared that Arpita had baked a beautiful cake for the special occasion. “The lockdown has been a learning curve for all of us. @arpitakhansharma is surprising us all with her hidden talent. We all are being treated to amazing food like Corn flake chicken to mushroom pasta, minced basil chicken to lasagna. Yesterday Arpita surprised us all by baking this beautiful cake for my our dad. Thank you so much love .. PS - please blame all my added fat to my wife. It’s getting hard to stay on my diet.”
On the work front, Aayush will be next seen in 'Kwatha', which features Katrina Kaif's sister Isabelle as the leading lady. Aayush will also share screen space with Salman Khan, as he plays a pivotal role in 'Kabhi Eid Kabhi Diwali '.
