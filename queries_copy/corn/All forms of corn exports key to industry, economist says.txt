All forms of corn exports key to industry, economist says
The next six months will be a tough market environment, USGC economist says.
INDIANOLA, Iowa -- With large 2020 corn acreage estimates, large supplies, reductions in ethanol production, and a drop in feed usage, growing U.S. corn exports is the main focus for the U.S. Grains Council.
On Tuesday, Mike McGinnis, Successful Farming's Markets Editor, visited with Mike Dwyer, USGC Chief Economist, about how the U.S. can chew through the current pile of corn and the expected growing amount of supplies in 2021.
Because of COVID-19 coronavirus and a drop in crude oil prices, the latest estimate of the amount of corn to be lost to ethanol production is 550 million bushels, according to Scott Irwin, a Farmdoc expert at the University of Illinois. If the economy gets back up and running in May, pent up demand for driving and traveling could limit the damage to corn used for ethanol.
While both countries deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 coronavirus, China and Brazil remain very good candidates to consume large amounts of U.S. ethanol in the future, Dwyer says.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., there are continued examples of demand destruction for corn. The livestock sector is seeing a backup of inventory with milk being dumped, eggs being opened and spilled out and week over week hog and cattle slaughter capacity dropping by 35% and 16%, respectively, last week.
As a result, fewer animals will be fed with the economic slowdown.
