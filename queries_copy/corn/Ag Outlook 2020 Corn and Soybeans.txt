Michael Langemeier, associate director of the Center for Commercial Agriculture at Purdue University, and James Mintert, director of the center, offered a webinar focused on the agricultural outlook for 2020’s corn and soybean growers.
Mintert shared that the USDA’s net farm income figures from 2000 to 2019, deflated and expressed in 2019 dollars, rose from $85.5 billion to $92.5 billion.
The difference shows “almost a 50% increase compared to where we were in 2016. So it’s been a pretty significant rebound in net farm income.”
But what concerns him is the percentage that comes out of direct government payments. Those have increased from $13.9 billion in 2018 to $22.4 billion in 2019.
“That’s up 61%,” Mintert said. “Without the increase, we wouldn’t have an increase in farm income this year.”
Purdue surveyors also looked at the percentage of farms in financial stress to compare current-day farms with two recent periods of financial stress: the 1980s farm crisis and the agricultural downturn in the early 2000s.
Langemeier said that although 5% of current day farmers are experiencing some financial stress, it’s not comparable to the 12% of farmers in the 1980s crisis nor the 9% in the early 2000s.
“There’s two components to financial stress: negative profit margin and high debt,” Langemeier said. “Over 50% have negative profit margins or pretty close to that.”
High debt-to-asset ratio hasn’t increased much. Part of the reason is that U.S. farmland makes up 83% of assets on farm balance sheets and land values have remained stable.
“In some areas, land prices are significantly higher than prior to 2007, which has kept financial stress at much lower levels than it would have been,” Langemeier said
“We’re not saying the farm income out there is great, but compared to periods with severe stress, it’s not close to that magnitude,” Mintert said.
Purdue surveyors also asked farmers about the size of their farm’s operating loan for 2020 compared with 2019. Seventeen percent expected it to be smaller, 64% anticipated it remaining the same and 19% expected it to increase.
“I was a little surprised that ‘smaller’ was 17%,” Langemeier said. “These are full-time farms.”
Mintert said that a part of the reason could be that half of the farmers interviewed were looking forward to retiring or scaling back their operations soon.
Of those anticipating a larger loan, 30% said it was because they planned to carry over unpaid operating debt.
“That means 6% of our sample plans to carry over unpaid operating debt,” Mintert said.
He added that between 5-8% of farms suffer “a significant degree of financial stress” but that is still well under the rate of severe stress, which ranged between 9-12%.
Both agricultural economists said that the U.S. corn yields were surprisingly good at 167 bushels per acre, based upon December estimates, compared with 176 in 2018 and 177 in 2017.
“I don’t think too many of us thought we’d see 167,” Langemeier said. “Especially in the Corn Belt, yields are better than expected.”
Although 2019 was the third year in a row for corn production decline at 13.661 billion bushels, compared with 14.420 in 2018, 14.609 in 2017 and 15.148 in 2016, “it’s still a large number,” Langemeier said, “but it’s starting to make an impact.”
Ethanol usage has plateaued, which affects demand for corn.
“Now that we’ve caught up with the supply side, we need a new source of demand,” Langemeier said.
Mintert expects corn acreage to rebound in 2020, but how much is hard to determine.
“Use of acreage was pretty flat,” he said.
Langemeier said that one reason that 2019 yield was higher than expected is that planting nationwide ranged from May to even later than June 15.
The number of acres planted to soybeans plummeted, as financially, it made more sense to plant corn. The crop insurance program favored corn and pricing also made it the more attractive of the two crops.
The yield was down a bushel or two per acre, but Langemeier said that was not as low as the 4 bushels per acre that some analysts thought would happen.
Because of all of these factors, soybean production declined 20%.
“It really tightened up the supply,” Langemeier said, “but maybe not as much as we thought last summer.”
“Odds would favor a soybean crop in 2020 above 4 billion bushels to keep that carryover about flat,” Mintert said. “We could increase about 500 million bushels and probably not affect the carryover usage much.”
He added that corn has been decreasing since 2016.
“We’ve been consuming more corn than we’re producing for the last few years,” Mintert said.
Looking ahead to the 2020 corn crop, Mintert said the December 2020 corn futures are settled at $4.01 per bushel and May 2021 corn futures are settled at $4.15 a bushel.
“If you haven’t been doing any pricing, these are not unattractive prices, so take a look at it,” Mintert said.
The November 2020 soybean futures are settled at $9.66 a bushel.
