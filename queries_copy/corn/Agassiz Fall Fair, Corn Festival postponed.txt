One of the Agassiz’s long-standing traditions is shelved due to COVID-19.
On Tuesday (June 23) morning, the Agassiz Agricultural and Horticultural Association (AAHA) annoucned the postponement of the 116th Fall Fair and 72nd Corn Festival. These festivals haven’t been cancelled since the 1948 flood and during the years of World War II.
“The directors had already been planning for the 2020 Fair and Corn Festival, and we had hope that more event would be able to be held by September of this year,” states a letter from AAHA officials. “Unfortunately, there is still a risk of the virus being spread and to protect the health and safety of our attendees, we have decided to postpone the 2020 Fair.”
The board of directors added their members are working to plan some alternative events and options to allow would-be fair-goers to still have a taste of the fair that would’ve been.
“We are looking into having our famous, tasty corn and chicken barbecue and delicious pies that are available at the fair,” the statement reads. “We will have our children’s coulouring contest, and, of course, the competitive Corn King and Queen Contest.”
Stay turned in the next few weeks to their website and Facebook page to stay up to date on the activites being planned. Any questions and suggestions should be directed to info@agassizfallfair.com or by calling 604-796-3246.
