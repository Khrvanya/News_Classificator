Saanich police responded to a report of a sexual assault in the Galey Farms corn maze involving a 16-year-old girl.
Police said the girl was walking through the maze with her mother Oct. 25 when she was touched from behind in a sexual way. Prior to that, comments had been made by some boys nearby.
The mother and daughter quickly identified a group of 13-year-old boys, but weren’t able to pinpoint the particular boy responsible because there were so many people in the area.
Galey Farms staff stepped in to help and three teenagers were detained when police arrived. Parents of the boys were contacted.
Police are looking for witnesses or anyone else who was approached in a similar way, and are working to identify who touched the girl.
“It’s disturbing in the sense that the people that we believe are involved are quite young,” Saanich police Staff Sgt. Chris Horsley said of the incident.
It was a brazen act, he said.
“It’s busy with a lot of people attending the maze and, of course, in this instance the victim was walking with her mother.”
He said police responded with multiple vehicles because they take such incidents very seriously.
Contact Saanich police at 250-475-4321 with any information.
