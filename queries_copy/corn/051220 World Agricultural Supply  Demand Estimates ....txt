WHEAT: The initial outlook for 2020/21 U.S. wheat is for smaller supplies, decreased domestic use,
lower carry-in stocks and smaller production. The 2020/21 U.S. wheat crop is projected at 1,866
million bushels, down 3 percent from last year on lower yields offsetting higher harvested acreage.
The all-wheat yield is projected at 49.5 bushels per acre, down 2.2 bushels from last year. The first
percent from 2019, on lower Hard Red Winter and White Winter production. Total 2020/21 domestic
corn supplies are expected to displace wheat for feeding. Higher food use is partially offsetting as
2020/21 is projected up 2 million bushels to 964 million, up from a revised 2019/20 estimate of 962
million, which was raised 7 million this month. The NASS Flour Milling Products report, issued on
May 1, indicated an unusually large volume of wheat was ground for flour in the first quarter of 2020.
Exports for 2020/21 are projected at 950 million bushels, down 20 million from the revised 2019/20
major exporters projected having larger supplies. Projected 2020/21 ending stocks are 69 million
bushels lower than last year at 909 million. The projected season-average farm price is $4.60 per
bushel, unchanged from last year as the outlook for low U.S. corn prices is expected to restrain
The initial outlook for 2020/21 international wheat is for larger supplies, increased trade, greater
to 982.4 million as several major exporters (Argentina, Australia, Canada, and Russia) are projected
to have higher production for 2020/21. Australia is projected with the largest increase from last year
to 24.0 million tons, up 8.8 million as it recovers from a multi-year drought. Conversely, the EU is
projected to decline nearly 12 million tons to 143 0 million on lower harvested area and yields.
Ukraine production is also projected lower at 28.0 million tons, but this would still be the secondlargest production on record.
Projected 2020/21 global trade is 4.6 million tons, or more than 2 percent higher, at a record-high
188.0 million on greater exportable supplies. Imports are projected to rise, primarily on increased
2020/21 leading world wheat exporter at 35.0 million tons with Argentina, Australia, and Canada also
projected higher while the EU, Ukraine, and United States are lower. Projected 2020/21 world
consumption is increased 4.9 million tons to a record-large 753.5 million as higher food, seed, and
industrial use more than offsets reduced feed use on greater global corn supplies. Projected 2020/21

U.S. 2020/21 corn exports are forecast to rise 375 million bushels to 2,150 million, driven by growth
in world corn trade. U.S. market share is expected to increase from the 2019/20 multi-year low, but
With total U.S. corn supply rising more than use, 2020/21 U.S. ending stocks are up 1.2 billion
bushels from last year and if realized would be the highest since 1987/88. Stocks relative to use at
22.4 percent would be the highest since 1992/93. With larger stocks relative to use, the seasonaverage farm price is projected at $3.20 per bushel, down 40 cents from 2019/20 and the lowest
stocks. World corn production is forecast record-high, with the largest increases for the United
States, Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico, and Canada. Global corn use is expected to grow 4 percent, with
foreign consumption up 3 percent. Global corn imports are projected to increase 4 percent. Notable
forecast increases in corn imports include the EU, Egypt, Mexico, Iran, Morocco, and Vietnam.
Global corn ending stocks are up from a year ago, as a decline in foreign stocks is more than offset
by an increase for the United States. Excluding China and the United States, ending stocks are up 4
percent relative to a year ago.
For China, total coarse grain imports are forecast at 18.3 million tons, up 1.3 million from 2019/20 but
below the 2014/15 record of 25.7 million tons. Since 2001/02, China’s largest individual coarse grain
import total occurred during 2014/15 with 10.2 million tons of sorghum. Over that same time period
realized corn imports reached a high of 5.5 million tons. Expectations are for robust demand from
China in 2020/21, with 7.0 million tons of corn, 6.0 million of barley, and 5.0 million of sorghum
RICE: For the 2019/20 market year, exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 98 million and the all rice
season-average farm price (SAFP) is lowered $0.20 per cwt to $13.00. The 2020/21 outlook for U.S.
rice is for larger supplies, exports, domestic use, and ending stocks. U.S. 2020/21 all rice production
is projected at 216.2 million cwt, up 17 percent from the previous year. Partly offsetting the increased
2020/21 crop is a 32 percent decrease in beginning stocks. The total 2020/21 rice supply is
projected at 279.3 million cwt, up 7 percent from last year. U.S. 2020/21 total use is projected at
exports higher. All rice ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 41.8 million cwt, up 37 percent
from the previous year’s low level. The 2020/21 SAFP is projected at $12.90 per cwt, down $0.10
from the 2019/20 revised SAFP.
World production for 2020/21 is projected at 502.0 million tons, a record, and up nearly 2 percent
tons and 2.3 million tons, respectively. The largest production declines are for the Philippines and
Brazil. Global rice consumption is projected at a record-large 498.1 million tons, up 7.9 million from
the previous year. Global exports for 2020/21 are projected at 45.2 million tons, up 2.8 million tons
from the previous year. With supplies rising more than use, global 2020/21 ending stocks are a
record-large 184.2 million tons with China and India respectively holding 64 and 21 percent.
OILSEEDS: The 2020/21 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports, and lower
ending stocks compared to 2019/20. The soybean crop is projected at 4.125 billion bushels, up 568
million from last year on increased harvested area and trend yields. Despite lower beginning stocks,
soybean supplies are projected up 5 percent from 2019/20 to 4.720 billion bushels. Total U.S.
oilseed production for 2020/21 is forecast at 123.2 million tons, up 16.1 million from 2019/20 mainly
on higher soybean production. Production forecasts are also higher for sunflowerseed, peanuts, and
cottonseed. Canola production is forecast lower on a reduced yield.
The U.S. soybean crush for 2020/21 is projected at 2.130 billion bushels, up slightly from the 2019/20
forecast with higher soybean meal disappearance partly offset by lower soybean meal exports. U.S.
soybean exports are forecast at 2.050 billion bushels, up 375 million from the revised forecast for
2019/20. With higher global soybean import demand for 2020/21 led by expected gains for China,
U.S. export share is expected to rise to 34 percent from the 2019/20 record low of 30 percent. U.S.
ending stocks for 2020/21 are projected at 405 million bushels, down 175 million from the revised
2019/20 forecast. The 2020/21 U.S. season-average soybean price is projected at $8.20 per bushel,
down 30 cents from 2019/20. Soybean meal prices are forecast at $290 per short ton, down $10.00
from 2019/20. Soybean oil prices are forecast at 29.0 cents per pound, up 0.5 cents from 2019/20.
record production; however, ending stocks are expected to decline modestly with rising use. Global
oilseed production for 2020/21 is projected at a record 605.9 million tons, up 30.7 million from
2019/20 mainly on higher soybean production. Global soybean production is forecast up 26.6 million
tons to 362.8 million, with Brazil’s crop rising 7.0 million tons to 131.0 million, Argentina’s crop is up
2.5 million tons to 53.5 million, and U.S. production rising from last year’s decline. Partly offsetting
are smaller soybean crops projected for China and Ukraine. Global production of high-oil content
seeds is projected up 3 percent from 2019/20 on increased canola production for Canada, Australia,
and Ukraine, and higher sunflowerseed production for Argentina and Ukraine. Partly offsetting is
lower sunflowerseed production for Turkey.
Global protein meal consumption outside of China is projected to increase 2 percent in 2020/21,
down from the prior 5-year average of 3 percent due to the slowing global economy. Protein meal
consumption in China at 6 percent is stronger than the prior few years, however, as China recovers
from the August 2018 outbreak of African Swine Fever. With higher protein meal demand, soybean
exports are expected to increase 8.0 million tons to 161.9 million. China accounts for most of the
increase in shipments with imports rising 4 million tons to 96 million. Global soybean ending stocks
are projected at 98.4 million tons, down 1.9 million from 2019/20. Lower year-over-year U.S. stocks
offset higher stocks in China, Brazil, and Argentina.
prospects for significant gains in the national yield over last year. Assuming average levels of beet
pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.965 million
month due to processors’ reporting. Cane sugar production for 2020/21 is projected at 4.040 million
STRV. Production in Florida and Texas are expected to be close to prior year levels. Louisiana
production is projected higher at 1.800 million STRV on a return to trend yield and recovery.
Imports for 2020/21 are projected at 3.461 million STRV. TRQ imports are projected at 1.395 million
STRV with levels set at minimum levels consistent with the WTO and FTA bindings. Projected
quantities have not been announced by the Secretary of Agriculture. The WTO raw sugar TRQ
shortfall for 2020/21 is projected at 99,208 STRV. High-tier tariff imports for 2020/21 are projected at
50,000 STRV. Imports from Mexico for 2020/21 are projected at 1.660 million STRV. Imports from
Mexico for 2019/20 are reduced by 148,840 STRV to 1.050 million on lower production in Mexico.
Deliveries to domestic users for 2020/21 are projected at 12.320 million STRV, flat with levels
estimated for 2019/20. Ending stocks for 2020/21 are residually projected at 1.468 million STRV,
implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 11.97 percent, up from 10.38 percent in 2019/20.
weather and area harvested projected at about the same level as this year. Production for 2019/20 is
reduced by 110,000 MT to 5.125 million, mainly on reduced area for harvest and below-average
1.493 million MT, the same level as now estimated for 2019/20. Per capita sweetener deliveries for
2020/21 for human consumption are projected at the same level as in 2019/20, implying sugar
deliveries at 4.140 million MT. IMMEX deliveries for 2020/21 from domestic and imported sources

part of the year and be marketed and slaughtered in 2021. Heavier carcass weights are also
expected to support higher production. Pork production is expected to increase as the sector
recovers from the slaughter adjustments of 2020. Broiler production is expected to surpass 2020
levels on expectations of improved returns. Turkey and egg production are forecast higher as
producers respond to favorable prices in 2020. For 2020, the total red meat and poultry production
forecast is reduced from last month as the sector adjusts to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty.

expected increase in global demand. For 2020, export forecasts for beef and pork are reduced on
slower expected export growth due to economic weakness and reduced supplies. Broiler exports are
raised on current trade data and firm demand; the turkey export forecast is virtually unchanged.
For 2021, fed cattle, hog, and broiler prices are forecast higher on stronger expected demand,
despite larger production. The 2021 turkey price forecast is fractionally below 2020. Egg prices in
2021 are forecast lower on supply pressure. For 2020, fed cattle prices are forecast lower on current
demand expectations as the year progresses. Broiler prices are forecast lower on current prices,
while turkey and egg price forecasts are raised.
Milk production for 2021 is forecast higher than 2020 on stronger expected growth in milk per cow,
despite a slightly smaller dairy cow herd. Commercial exports on a fat basis are about the same as
2020 while skim-solids basis exports are forecast higher than 2020 on relatively firm demand.
Imports on both a fat basis and skim-solid basis are forecast above 2020. With improved domestic
and export demand, all dairy products prices are forecast higher in 2021. Both Class III and Class IV
prices are forecast higher on stronger product prices. The 2021 all milk price is forecast higher at
The 2020 milk production forecast is raised from the previous month primarily on higher-thanexpected cow numbers. The fat basis export forecast is raised from the previous month on recent
trade data and stronger expected global demand. The fat basis import forecast is also raised from
last month on stronger expected imports of cheese. On a skim-solids basis, the export forecast for
2020 is raised on stronger global import demand for skim milk powder, whey products, and a number
price forecast. Butter and NDM prices are lowered from last month, resulting in a lower Class IV
price forecast. The 2020 all milk price is forecast at $14.55 per cwt.
COTTON: The U.S. cotton forecasts for 2020/21 include larger beginning stocks, consumption,
exports, and ending stocks compared with the year before. Production is forecast at 19.5 million
bales—400,000 bales less than the year before, based on 13.7 million planted acres as indicated in
the NASS March Prospective Plantings report. Planted area is expected to be virtually unchanged
from 2019/20, but harvested area is projected 2 percent lower, as abandonment rises from 2019/20.
The yield is projected only slightly higher, using 10-year regional averages. Domestic mill use and
exports are expected to rebound as the world economy begins to recover. Mill use is expected to
rise 200,000 bales, and exports by 1 million; but ending stocks are expected to rise 600,000 bales to
7.7 million, equivalent to 41 percent of use. This would be marginally higher than in 2019/20 and the
highest since 2007/08’s 55 percent. The price received by upland producers is forecast at 57 cents
For 2019/20, U.S. cotton production is raised slightly from last month. The export forecast is
unchanged, but expected consumption is 200,000 bales lower, and ending stocks 400,000 bales
World ending stocks in 2020/21 are projected to rise for a second consecutive year, but at a much
slower pace. With harvested area down globally, production is expected to decline 3.7 million bales,
while consumption is expected to rise 11.5 million bales as the global economy begins recovering.
Global ending stocks are expected to rise 2.3 million bales, but fall as a share of consumption, from
93 percent in 2019/20 to 85 percent.
For 2019/20, the world consumption forecast is reduced to 105.0 million bales, down 5.6 million from
the previous forecast and 12.7 percent below the previous year. This would be the largest annual
decline in world consumption since the 19th century. World production is raised 1 million bales from
the previous month, and 2019/20 ending stocks are 5.9 million higher. The revised year-to-year
increase in global ending stocks is 16.9 million bales.
