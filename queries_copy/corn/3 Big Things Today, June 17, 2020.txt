Wheat Futures Fall Overnight; Russia Won’t Impose Export Quotas in 2020.
Wheat futures were lower in overnight trading on harvest pressure and on signs of slack demand from overseas buyers.
About 15% of the U.S. winter wheat crop was harvested as of Sunday, on par with the prior five-year average, the USDA said in a report.
In Kansas, the biggest U.S. producer of the grain, the harvest was 9% complete, ahead of the normal 8% for this time of the year, the USDA said. In Oklahoma, 40% was in the bin vs. the 43% average.
Half the crop was in good or excellent condition at the start of the week, down 1 percentage point from the previous week. The crop probably won’t turn out as good as last year when 64% had earned top ratings at this point.
The USDA last week pegged wheat exports in the 2020-2021 marketing year that just started on June 1 at 925 million bushels, down from 983 million a year earlier. Exporters sold 270,400 metric tons of wheat to offshore buyers in the first four days of the marketing year, the government said.
Wheat futures for July delivery fell 3½¢ to $4.92 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade, while Kansas City futures declined 3½¢ to $4.34¾ a bushel.
Corn futures for July delivery lost 2¢ to $3.26½ a bushel overnight.
Soybean futures fell ¾¢ to $8.66¼ a bushel. Soy meal futures rose 10¢ to $288 a short ton, and soy oil lost 0.08¢ to 27.91¢ a pound.
Russian grain exports will move unimpeded – at least by the Russians – until at least December, according to the country’s Agriculture Ministry.
The ministry has said several times in the past couple of months that it would, in fact, limit exports in a bid to ensure ample domestic supplies as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.
So far there have been more than 550,000 confirmed cases of the virus in Russia with about 7,500 deaths reports, according to Johns Hopkins University. Globally, about 8.2 million cases have been confirmed and the death toll is now over 444,000, the university said.
Russia, the world’s largest wheat exporter, said it may impose export quotas starting in January if it feels that grain levels are falling dangerously low.
The USDA last week pegged Russian wheat exports in the 2020-2021 marketing year that started on June 1 at 36 million metric tons, up from 33.5 million tons a year earlier. Production is seen at 77 million metric tons, up from 73.6 million the prior year.
Ending stockpiles in Russia are seen at 9.28 million metric tons this year, up from 8.28 million the previous year.
The USDA’s production estimate for wheat is on the low end as global estimates range from 77 million to 81 million metric tons, Commerzbank analysts Michaela Helbing-Kuhl said in a note to clients on Wednesday. All of the forecasts top the previous year’s figure.
“That said, international demand for Russian wheat is also likely to increase because lower crops than last year are on the cards in rival countries such as the EU and Ukraine,” Helbing-Kuhl said.
Red-flag warnings are still in effect for much of eastern Colorado and a couple counties in western Kansas and the Oklahoma panhandle this morning amid strong winds and low relative humidity, according to the National Weather Service.
Winds in the region are ranging from about 15 to 25 mph with gusts of up to 35 mph, the NWS said in a report early this morning.
Relative humidity in the area will drop as low as 9%, creating conditions ripe for wildfires. Any fires that start are expected to spread rapidly, the agency said.
Critical conditions also are creating tinderbox-like conditions in parts of western Minnesota this morning. Winds are forecast from 20 to 30 mph with stronger gusts throughout the day.
Temperatures are expected to almost hit 100˚F. with relative humidity around 25% in parts of southwestern Minnesota, the NWS said.
