Something very exciting is germinating in the commodities market. Corn is preparing to begin a major bull market. And there is more than technical evidence suggesting that’s the case.
First the technicals. Corn has been in a 45-year bear market. From its 1974 peak, corn has underperformed the S&P by an astounding 98%, as the S&P 500 zoomed from 65 to 2950.
The accompanying chart shows that corn outperformed the S&P 500 by 300% from its 2000 low to its 2011 high. From that high, corn’s relative strength shriveled—undercutting slightly its 2000 low. But from its “relative” bottom in August 2000 when the S&P closed at 1520, corn has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20% through Wednesday’s 2783 close.
What hasn’t gotten attention is that relative strength has formed a major double bottom to its 2000 low. During the past 18 months, relative strength has been forming a base and gaining the support of two important moving averages, a necessary condition to signal that a bottom is being formed. Also, momentum has made higher lows since 2014, even as relative strength made lower lows—a bullish divergence.
As to the fundamentals, swine flu continues to spread in China —with no known cure. China’s stock of live pigs has dropped (20%) from last year. That has led Chinese consumers to begin adding more beef to their diets. Corn is the feedstock of cattle.
Armyworms are threatening corn crops also . Since landing in Africa in 2016, armyworms have spread to more than 50 countries in Africa and Asia in just two years (including China and India).
Bottom Line: Corn is preparing to launch a new secular bull market vs. the stock market. Once relative strength hurdles its 47-month moving average decisively, the corn bull will sprout .
