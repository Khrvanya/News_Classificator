As much as 6 inches of snow are expected in the region, with accumulations of a light ice glaze also forecast, the NWS said in a report this morning.
A winter weather advisory also is in effect in areas surrounding the blizzard where 2 inches of snow and a glaze of ice are forecast. Wind gusts of up to 40 mph also are expected.
“Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility,” the NWS said. “Conditions will be hazardous to livestock and newborn calves. Travel could be very difficult.”
Farther south, rain showers are expected in parts of southern Missouri this evening and overnight, the agency said. Minor flooding is a possibility.
The storms will continue Wednesday and Thursday, increasing the chances for limited flooding.
