Lighter evenings, BBQs and not wearing a jacket. Ah, summer. It's all bloody dandy until you're walking to the end of your road and are suddenly struck down with the dreaded 'chub rub'.
A lethal cocktail of bare skin, heat, and ultimately sweat can leave the inside of our thighs feeling very sore indeed.
But women everywhere have seemingly found the cure for thigh chafing - these ultra-comfy shorts from Amazon.
Yes, they're not sexy. Sure, they're not winning any beauty contests. But, reader, they will fast become your favourite pair of shorts.
One reviewer called the Â£21.99 briefs "an absolute godsend in this weather", adding: "Although they look as though they would be hot to wear, the coolmax material really does keep you feeling cool and fresh all day.
"I'm on my feet all day walking round in an environment with no air con that heats up I like a greenhouse, but these keep me cool and really do stop changing completely.
Doubling up as shape wear, the shorts will also give you that snatched vibe, which is ideal for feeling more confident in this season's smock dress.
The shorts are hella inclusive and range from UK size 6 to 36 (US 2 to 32) and are made from machine-washable cotton and silicone.
