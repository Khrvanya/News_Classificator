'After searching online for something suitable, it dawned on me that I had something similar already - a pair of hold ups!
'I cut them to size and voila! Problem solved! Cheaper and not as thick as some of the other options.'
Chafing is something that can happen to everyone in the heat, no matter what their shape or size, and can be particularly problematic for those with bigger thighs.
And the post garnered more than 500 reactions on the Facebook page and those who have fallen victim to the painful chafing praised the idea.
Others shared their own DIY methods to protect against abrasions with fans hailing deodorant, liquid talc and lace bands to provide comfort when donning bare legs.
Many women opted for deodorant which has long been a go-to solution to beat chafing as it creates a barrier and can stop skin rubbing together.
Diana Umney Hayden added: 'It's a nightmare in the summer for us plus-size girls. I definitely will try the liquid talc.'
'Love this post. This has been my issue for a while since lockdown,' Bex Selly commented.
However Jade Dixon shared a picture of her leg with an £8 blue lace band to create a chafing barrier.
Posting a picture of her solution, she wrote: 'I have lace bands that sit on tops of my legs and don’t fall down about £8 and on second year of them.'
And it seemed the problem was not just for women, as Paul Harse commented: 'Us men get chub rub too you know!! Not sure I’ll be using a pair of hold ups though!!'
Others praised the Pretty Little Thing £8 anti-chafing bands which sent shoppers into frenzy when they were launched in 2018.
The product mimics the tops of stockings and they are very discreet size - rendering them invisible under even short dresses.
They start from just below the groin and stretch for a few inches down the thigh providing maximum protection from chafing.
