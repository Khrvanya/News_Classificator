A Gin Distillery in Whitby has switched some of its production from drinks to hand rub - as part of it's efforts to help with the COVID-19 lockdown.
Luke Pentith from the Whitby Gin Distillery says the demand for alcohol based hand rub has increased massively in the last few weeks..
The hand rub is being produced in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) formulation issued by the government.
Jessica Slater, Co-Founder of Whitby Distillery said:
“We decided to do this in order to support local businesses and organisations, however as soon as we posted that we would be manufacturing the alcohol hand rub, the phone line went mad with lots of enquiries and orders from companies, including Scarborough Borough Council, GP practices and nursing homes, as well as to supply products for the Nightingale Hospital at Excel in London.”
Luke says the order from the NHS Nightingale hospital in London was one of the biggest single deliveries they have ever undertaken.
