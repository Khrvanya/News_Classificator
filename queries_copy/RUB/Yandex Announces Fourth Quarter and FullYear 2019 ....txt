*  Total segment results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 include financial results of our E-commerce segment. E-commerce segment revenues and adjusted EBITDA include revenues and adjusted EBITDA of Yandex.Market through April 27, 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% in Q4 2019 compared with Q4 2018. The growth was mainly driven by the solid performance of Search and Portal segment and continuing improvement of our Taxi and Classifieds segments profitability, which were slightly offset by our investments in car-sharing business and Media Services.
Interest income in Q4 2019 was RUB 807 million, compared with RUB 929 million in Q4 2018.
Interest expense in Q4 2019 was RUB 31 million, down from RUB 221 million in Q4 2018.
Foreign exchange loss in Q4 2019 was RUB 999 million, compared with a foreign exchange gain of RUB 273 million in Q4 2018. This loss reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble during Q4 2019 from RUB 64.4156 to $1.00 on September 30, 2019, to RUB 61.9057 to $1.00 on December 31, 2019. Yandex's Russian operating subsidiaries' functional currency is the Russian ruble, and therefore changes due to exchange rate fluctuations in the ruble value of these subsidiaries' monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies are recognized as foreign exchange gains or losses within the other income/(loss), net line in the condensed consolidated statements of income. Although the U.S. dollar value of Yandex's U.S. dollar-denominated assets and liabilities was not impacted by these currency fluctuations, they resulted in a downward revaluation of the ruble equivalent of these U.S. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities in Q4 2019.
Income tax expense for Q4 2019 was RUB 3,068 million, up from RUB 2,412 million in Q4 2018. Our effective tax rate of 91.6% in Q4 2019 was higher than in Q4 2018, primarily due to increase in stock-based compensation which is non-deductible. Adjusted for SBC expense, certain losses from equity-method investments which are non-deductible, goodwill impairment and certain tax provisions recognized, our effective tax rate for Q4 2019 was 33.0%, compared with 27.9% for Q4 2018 as adjusted for SBC expense and similar effects in that year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily driven by certain additional valuation allowances provided in Q4 2019.
Net income was RUB 0.3 billion ($4.5 million) in Q4 2019, down 95% compared with Q4 2018.
Adjusted net income in Q4 2019 was RUB 5.4 billion ($87.2 million), a 22% decrease from Q4 2018.
Adjusted net income margin was 10.4% in Q4 2019, compared with 17.9% in Q4 2018.
As of December 31, 2019, Yandex had cash, cash equivalents and term deposits of RUB 88.3 billion ($1,426.5 million), including cash, cash equivalents and term deposits of Yandex.Taxi in total amount of RUB 24.4 billion ($394.4 million).

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These include statements regarding our anticipated revenues for full year 2020. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted or implied by such statements, and our reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted or implied by such statements include, among others, macroeconomic and geopolitical developments affecting the Russian economy or our business, changes in the political, legal and/or regulatory environment, competitive pressures, changes in advertising patterns, changes in user preferences, technological developments, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2018 and “Risk Factors” in the Shareholder Circular filed as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 6-K, which were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 19, 2019 and November 18, 2019, respectively, and are available on our investor relations website at http://ir.yandex.com/sec.cfm and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. All information in this release and in the attachments is as of February 14, 2020, and Yandex undertakes no duty to update this information unless required by law.
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present the following non-GAAP financial measures: ex-TAC revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted ex-TAC EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted net income margin and adjusted ex-TAC net income margin. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable U.S. GAAP measures”, included following the accompanying financial tables. We define the various non-GAAP financial measures we use as follows:
Adjusted EBITDA means U.S. GAAP net income plus (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) SBC expense, (3) accrual of expense related to the contingent compensation payable to employees in connection with certain business combinations, (4) one-off restructuring expenses, (5) interest expense, (6) loss from equity method investments, (7) income tax expense and (8) goodwill impairment, less (1) effect of Yandex.Market deconsolidation, (2) interest income and (3) other (income)/loss, net
Adjusted EBITDA margin means adjusted EBITDA divided by U.S. GAAP revenues
Adjusted net income means U.S. GAAP net income plus (1) SBC expense adjusted for the income tax reduction attributable to SBC expense, (2) accrual of expense related to the contingent compensation payable to certain employees in connection with certain business combinations, (3) one-off restructuring expenses, (4) amortization of debt discount related to our convertible debt adjusted for the related reduction in income tax and (5) goodwill impairment, less (1) foreign exchange (gains)/losses adjusted for increase/(reduction) in income tax attributable to foreign exchange (gains)/losses and (2) effect of deconsolidation of former subsidiaries
Adjusted net income margin means adjusted net income divided by U.S. GAAP revenues
These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for evaluating financial performance as well as decision-making. Management believes that these metrics reflect the organic, core operating performance of the company, and therefore are useful to analysts and investors in providing supplemental information that helps them understand, model and forecast the evolution of our operating business.
Although our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for operational decision-making and considers these financial measures to be useful for analysts and investors, we recognize that there are a number of limitations related to such measures. In particular, it should be noted that several of these measures exclude some recurring costs, particularly share-based compensation. In addition, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of the measures described above may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations.
Below we describe why we make particular adjustments to certain U.S. GAAP financial measures:
We believe that it may be useful for investors and analysts to review certain measures both in accordance with U.S. GAAP and net of the effect of TAC, which we view as comparable to sales commissions and bonuses but, unlike sales commissions and bonuses, are not deducted from U.S. GAAP revenues. By presenting revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted net income margin net of TAC, we believe that investors and analysts are able to obtain a clearer picture of our business without the impact of the revenues we share with our partners.
SBC is a significant expense item, and an important part of our compensation and incentive programs. As it is a non-cash charge, however, and highly dependent on our share price at the time of equity award grants, we believe that it is useful for investors and analysts to see certain financial measures excluding the impact of these charges in order to obtain a clearer picture of our operating performance.
We may incur expenses in connection with acquisitions that are not indicative of our recurring core operating performance. In particular, we are required under U.S. GAAP to accrue as expense the contingent compensation that is payable to certain employees in connection with certain business combinations. We eliminate these acquisition-related expenses from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to provide management and investors a tool for comparing on a period-to-period basis our operating performance in the ordinary course of operations.
Because we hold significant assets and liabilities in currencies other than our Russian ruble operating currency, and because foreign exchange fluctuations are outside of our operational control, we believe that it is useful to present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and related margin measures excluding these effects, in order to provide greater clarity regarding our operating performance.
Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2019 exclude expenses related to restructuring targeted amendments to Corporate Governance Structure approved by shareholders in December 2019.  We believe that it is useful to present adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and related margin measures excluding impacts not related to our operating activities.
We believe that it is useful to present adjusted net income and related margin measures excluding the effect of deconsolidation of former subsidiaries and to present certain other financial metrics described above in order to provide a clearer picture of our underlying operating performance and to provide meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted net income in 2018 excludes a gain from deconsolidation of Yandex.Market following the formation of Yandex.Market joint venture by Yandex and Sberbank in April 2018.
We also adjust net income for interest expense representing amortization of the debt discount related to our convertible notes issued in Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 which matured in Q4 2018. We have eliminated this expense from adjusted net income as it is non-cash in nature and is not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2019 exclude a loss from goodwill impairment related to Food Party business. We test our goodwill annually for impairment. In Q4 2019, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge for RUB 762 million which is the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We believe that it is useful to present adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and related margin measures excluding impacts not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.
The tables at the end of this release provide detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure we use from the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.
