You can now make your own hand sanitizer, but should you?
Hand sanitizers are scarce in the face of the growing COVID-19 outbreak. Thatâ€™s why websites are offering to teach you how to make a version at home.
The website DIY Natura l lists ingredients and instructions for a softly-scented natural homemade product. It includes lavender and tea tree essential oils, aloe vera gel, vitamin E oil, and either rubbing alcohol or high-proof vodka.
The author said she even likes it better than the commercial variety because it does not have a chemical smell.
Even the World Health Organization has a recipe guide for alcohol-based hand-rub formulas. It calls for isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, glycerol and sterile distilled or boiled water. No essential oils like a lot of the do-it-yourself recipes.
