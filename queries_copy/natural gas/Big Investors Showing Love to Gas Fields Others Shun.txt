While speculators bet natural gas prices will fall, bullish field buyers see global demand ramping up
Speculators have a dim view of natural gas, piling into the biggest bet that prices will fall since last decade’s financial crisis. Big investors, such as Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, are moving in the other direction, gobbling up unloved gas fields.
Mr. Jones invested more than $1 billion in Comstock Resources Inc. to help the producer consolidate drilling fields in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and East Texas. Comstock shares have soared 68%—a top performer in an otherwise rotten year for oil-and-gas stocks.
