BJ Services CEO Warren Zemlak stands in front of the Titan, a new piece of equipment that uses a natural gas-fired turbine to power a hydraulic fracturing pump. Tested in the Haynesville Shale of East Texas, the Titan will now be deployed in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas and the Permian Basin of West Texas.
Tomball oil-field service company BJ Services plans to expand use of a cost-saving technology that can use natural gas produced at a remote drilling site to power hydraulic fracturing operations.
BJ Services and customer Dallas oil company Aethon Energy recently wrapped up a series of successful tests of the Titan at hydraulic fracturing sites in Haynesville Shale of East Texas, the companies said Thursday. BJ Services plans to deploy the natural gas-fired turbine and frac pump combo in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas.
Touted as a replacement for diesel-powered frac pumps, the 5,000-horsepower Titan was designed to power hydraulic fracturing operations with lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower maintenance costs, improved mobility and less noise.
Most of the BJ Services hydraulic fracturing fleet runs diesel but the company's CEO Warren Zemlak said the Titan is a step toward cleaner and more profitable operations.
"The successful field trial confirms our decision to deploy our first contracted Titan fleet by the end of 2020 and initiates our long-term disciplined fleet enhancement strategy," Zemlak said.
