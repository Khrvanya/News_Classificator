Cooler Forecasts Buoy Natural Gas Prices, Threaten a Big Short
Bets that prices will keep falling are running into dropping temperatures in the Eastern U.S.
Forecasts for cooler weather to close out the month buoyed natural gas prices on Thursday, halting a slide that has trimmed roughly 20% off the heating fuel since early November.
Natural gas futures for January delivery rose 3.8% to $2.328 per million British thermal units. That is down about 44% from the same time last year and still the lowest mid December level in four years, but the renewed call for chilly temperatures allayed fears among traders and analysts of an impending drop below $2.
