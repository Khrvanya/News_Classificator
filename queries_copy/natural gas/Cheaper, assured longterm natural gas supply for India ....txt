India had earlier bought liquefied natural gas (LNG) under long-term contracts from Qatar and Australia at an average price of USD 3.5-4.5 per million British thermal units in the current quarter while the spot prices of LNG are in the range of USD 2. Petronet had also sought bids for 1 million tones of LNG per year for 10 years, starting 2024, from suppliers. The Petronet CEO also underlined that the company plans to set up 50 LNG dispensing stations along five highways in FY21 and expand it to 1,000 stations across India in later years.
