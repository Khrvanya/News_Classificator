With the new year upon us, we've been looking at stocks that could be set to outperform in the first quarter -- staying wary of the various risks facing bullish investors . Two names that have historically outperformed during the first quarter are oil-and-gas concerns Concho Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources.
Based on the data provided by Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, CXO shares have averaged an impressive 11.2% gain during the first quarter over the past 10 years, closing the period higher 90% of the time. The stock could certainly use the bounce, as it's lost more than 30% in the past three months. On a somewhat bullish note, however, the equity is on pace for a second straight close atop the 10-day moving average, last seen trading near $106.
These technical difficulties haven't been enough to shake the analysts in Concho Resources' bullish corner. As it stands now, 19 of the 23 covering brokerage firms recommend buying the shares, and there are no "sell" ratings on the books.
