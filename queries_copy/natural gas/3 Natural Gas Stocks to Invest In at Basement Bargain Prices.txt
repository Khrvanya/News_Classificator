Even before broader market collapse in February, natural gas stocks were falling fast. The reason was simple: natural gas prices were plunging.
Indeed, the Henry Hub spot price, a widely-used benchmark, is at a multi-year low . Heating demand generally drives higher prices in the winter, yet warmer weather and a supply glut have blocked that traditional booster.
The worry is that these trends will continue. Shale production shows little sign of slowing down. Oil drilling actually creates significant amounts of natural gas as a byproduct, to the point that prices in the Permian Basin occasionally turn negative . Other producers simply “flare” the gas instead of bringing it to market.
Consistently warmer winters, meanwhile, may pressure demand at the same time. The trade war with China led to tariffs on LNG (liquefied natural gas) exports, further pressuring prices.
Those low prices already are having an impact. Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK ), which gets over 40% of its revenue from natural gas, is on a clear path toward bankruptcy barring a sudden, steep pricing reversal. As Bloomberg noted last month, giants EQT (NYSE: EQT ) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX ) both will take multi-billion dollar asset writedowns due to the lower-price environment.
But to contrarian investors, the plunging prices could represent an opportunity. Prices could rebound at some point, as domestic producers cut back and demand from Asia rises.
For those investors, these three natural gas stocks are worth considering. To be sure, risks remain, and these stocks look like falling knives right now. Caution, and patience, is advised. Still, even in a market that suddenly offers a number of “buy the dip” opportunities, these names do look attractive.
