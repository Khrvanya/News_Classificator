The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission announced Thursday it had approved temporary changes to Cascade Natural Gasâ€™ Washington Energy Assistance Fund, aimed at helping customers who have lost income due to COVID-19.
The program allows residential natural gas customers to apply for hardship grants of up to $400, and the new changes lift an existing $500-per-household-per-year cap on the program.
The low-income verification requirement has also been relaxed to account for customers who have experienced a sudden loss of income.
The program funds are administered by local community action agencies. Customers can contact Cascade Natural Gas at 1-888-522-1130 to learn more.
Cascade Natural Gas is based in Kennewick and serves nearly 220,000 residential and business customers throughout Washington. The company had already voluntarily suspended disconnections for nonpayment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
