Last week’s turmoil in the financial markets, despite the best efforts of central banks and governments to counter the market meltdown, looks set to continue in the week ahead.
However, the outlook for the Euro against other currencies such as the British Pound is more positive.
Global central banks and governments did their best last week to counter the market meltdown caused by fears that the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus will do untold damage to the global economy. However, their efforts to curb the heavy selling of other assets to buy the US Dollar and raise cash did little to improve confidence.
In particular, the launch late Wednesday by the European Central Bank of a €750 billion emergency asset-purchase program failed to stabilize EUR/ USD , which dropped to levels last seen in April 2017.
