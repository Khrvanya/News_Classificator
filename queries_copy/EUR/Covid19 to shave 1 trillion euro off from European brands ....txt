However, the automobile sector led mostly by the German companies will be the main winners. Mercedez topped the list of gainers.
Hotels, airlines and airports are the worst affected by the pandemic and the impact on them will increase as more and more cities are under lockdowns and governments unveil more measures of social distancing by shutting down public transport, closing borders, the report said.
