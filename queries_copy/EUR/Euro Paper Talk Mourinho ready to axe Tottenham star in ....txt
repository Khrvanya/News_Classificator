Tottenham prepare a swap deal involving a first-team star and a top striker target, while Manchester City eye an €85million raid on Napoli – all in the latest Euro Paper Talk.
Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is willing to include Lucas Moura in a swap deal in a bid to convince Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik to Spurs, according to a report.
Milik’s future at Napoli is uncertain, given he only has one year remaining on the deal he signed in 2016.
Napoli’s sporting director revealed this month the club would resolve the player’s future by the start of next season.
Meanwhile, reports have claimed Spurs are keen on signing the 26-year-old to bolster their attack.
However, Tuttosport claims Napoli have knocked the north London side back in their approaches.
As such, Corrierre dello Sport says Mourinho is happy to see Moura go if it boosts his chances of signing Milik.
What’s more, the situation is complicated by Atletico Madrid’s interest in the striker.
The Spanish club have ended their interest in Edinson Cavani – according to AS – and will target Milik instead.
