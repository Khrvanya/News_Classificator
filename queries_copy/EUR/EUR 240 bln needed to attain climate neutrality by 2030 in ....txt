Poland needs EUR 240 billion for necessary investments aimed at achieving climate neutrality in 2030, Funds and Regional Policy Minister Malgorzata Jarosinska-Jedynak said at two-day United Nations Global Compact Leaders Summit in New York on Tuesday.
The minister took part in the "Climate change and just transition" discussion panel regarding the need for a deep transformation involving climate, social and energy justice, and preparing countries to achieve ambitious climate goals.
"The priority for Poland is the transformation towards a green economy carried out in such a way that it is safe and economically beneficial, as well as socially acceptable. This process must take place gradually in our country so as not to hinder our economic growth and reduce energy security," she said.
Jarosinska-Jedynak said that Poland, as a party to the Paris Climate Agreement, has committed to achieve climate neutrality in the second half of the 21st century. She added that in recent years the Polish government has undertaken numerous activities aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions and improving air quality.
Regarding achieving climate neutrality by 2030, she acknowledged that such a debate should not ignore the high socio-economic costs. "The value of investments needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2030 by Poland is EUR 240 billion. Our country will have to bear double the costs on its way to the green economy than the average in the European Union," the minister added.
