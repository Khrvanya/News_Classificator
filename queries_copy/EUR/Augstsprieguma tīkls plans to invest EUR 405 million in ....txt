Latvia’s electrical energy transmission system’s operator Augstsprieguma tīkls (AST) plans to invest EUR 405 million into development in the 2021 and 2030 period, according to the ten-year development plan submitted to the Public Utilities Commission (SPRK).
The most considerable changes are associated with increase of the transmission network’s capacity and the security of the Baltic region’s electricity supplies in order to achieve synchronization with continental Europe in 2025.
The synchronization project’s first phase includes increasing the output and reconstructing the two existing power lines from Valmiera to Tartu and Tsirguliina in Estonia, as well as procuring system synchronization and inertia equipment. General cost of EUR 76 million, of which 75% is attracted from European Union’s co-financing tool Connecting Europe Facility.
Synchronization project’s second phase includes not only securing modern and efficient equipment for inertia but also modernization of the cross-border commercial accounting system, modernization of the automatic and dispatch system, as well as other IT infrastructure. The EU has received a request for co-financing of 75%. The total costs of the second phase of the project are planned at EUR 99.5 million.
To stop the ageing of Latvia’s electricity transmissions network and sub-stations, thereby ensuring stable operation of the transmissions system and uninterrupted supply of electricity for connected users, AST plans to reconstruct 330 kV and 110 kV substation and transmission points, 330 kV and 110 kV electricity transmission lines, as well as replace 330 kV auto-transformers and 110 kV transformers.
Generally it is planned to invest EUR 228 million in these projects by 2030.
Financial investments are planned in order to reduce the number of machineries nearing their critical age and possible malfunctions.
