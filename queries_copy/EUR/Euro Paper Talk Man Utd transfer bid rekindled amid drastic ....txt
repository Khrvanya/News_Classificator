A Manchester United target threatens a surprise U-turn on his agreement, while Real Madrid register interest in a controversial Arsenal midfielder – all in the latest Euro Paper Talk.
Birmingham City midfielder Jude Bellingham is holding off on finalising a move to Borussia Dortmund by weighing up interest from other clubs, according to a report.
The teenager has shone in his breakthrough season in the Championship, missing only five league games.
As such, reports over several months claim Dortmund and Manchester United are keen on the 16-year-old.
More recently, though, Bellingham reportedly agreed to sign for the German side , with the deal announced in due course.
However, Kicker now claims the midfielder has “sparked desires” at several other clubs.
Bayern Munich have used the change of heart to register their interest, while United have also took notice and are again in the running.
Elsewhere, Kicker adds that Chelsea are also watching on with interest ahead of a potential move.
Bellingham has chipped in with four goals this season, including two match-winners in August and September.
