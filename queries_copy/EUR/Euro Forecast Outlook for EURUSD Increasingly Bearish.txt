EUR/USD continues to trade in a narrow range but as fears grow of a second wave of coronavirus infections a break to the downside is looking more and more likely.
For now, those fears are outweighing hopes of an easing of coronavirus restrictions that could allow normal economic activity to resume.
That in turn means funds will likely flow into haven assets such as the US Dollar at the expense of riskier assets like the Euro , the Australian Dollar , the British Pound and stocks.
EUR/ USD continues to trade sideways but a breakout is looking increasingly possible as traders weigh up fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections against an easing of restrictions in many countries that could allow a return of normal economic activity.
For a while now, an increase in Covid-19 concerns has prompted a flow of money into safe havens like the US Dollar from currencies seen as inherently riskier, such as the Euro. Any ramping up of pessimism about an economic revival would therefore likely see EUR/USD break to the downside.
