ANGOLA - Angola has received, through the Luanda port, the first batch of 75,000 head of cattle from Chad as repayment for $100 million debt.
The leaders of the two countries last year agreed that the 2017 debt would be paid with 75,000 head of cattle over 10 years.

More than 1,000 head of cattle were unloaded and handed over to the Angolan Agriculture and Forestry minister, Mr Ant√≥nio Assis, on Sunday.
