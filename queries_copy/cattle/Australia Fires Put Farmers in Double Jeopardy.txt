SYDNEY—In the days after wildfires tore through southeastern Australia’s sheep and cattle country, farmers rushed to bury their dead.
Among the farmers was Brett Jessop. On New Year’s Eve, a fire ravaged the 60-acre farm in Cobargo where he kept 250 dairy cattle, burning down a hay shed and exploding fuel drums. While Mr. Jessop was able to save his house and most of his herd, he couldn’t rescue 20 heifers trapped in a rocky paddock.
