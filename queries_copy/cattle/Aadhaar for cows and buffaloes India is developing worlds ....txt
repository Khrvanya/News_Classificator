During the process, every animal will be provided with an ear tag that would contain their own 12-digit UID. The INAPH will contain data on the bovinesâ€™ species, breed, pedigree, and information related to calving, milk production, vaccination, and the like.
INAPH, which will be known as Pashu Aadhaar, is being introduced with the aim of enhancing traceability of our livestock and their products, such as milk or meat. This will also help farmers and animal husbandry officials devise better strategies to manage livestock in the country. In fact, one of the major causes behind zoonotic diseases is the difficulty faced in identifying and tracing affected animals.
This, in turn, acts as one of the main obstacles while tapping global markets for indigenous livestock products. Therefore, to match global sanitary and phytosanitary standards, a system like INAPH that could provide a comprehensive animal information system, was necessary. This way, we would be easily able to demarcate between products obtained from healthy animals from the ones obtained from diseased animals.
As of now, about 22.3 million buffaloes and cows have got their UIDs and their data have been uploaded on the INAPH database. Once this step is complete, officials will have to leverage this data for better management of bovines that would ensure improved productivity and livestock product quality.
