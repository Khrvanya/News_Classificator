Commodity markets close early on Thursday. No trade on Friday.
We are now on the down hill slide of 2020. The good news it is starting with an petite for risk.  After one of the worst quarters equities rallied through the 2nd quarter for one of their best performances since Black Monday in 1987. Economic reports continue to show the US economy reopening strong. The labor market is coming around with the latest non farm payroll data grew by 4.8 million. Beating analyst estimates of 3.7 million. That dropped unemployment to 11.1%. That is a drop from 13.3% in May. The US trade deficit also grew to $54.6 billion. Up from May’s $49.8 billion.  The pending home sales index 44.3% beat May’s -21.8%. Consumer sentiment is up to 90.8 vs. last months 86.6. The case schiller home index ticked up 0.1% to 4.7%.
The US Dollar index finally broke through nearby support levels on Wednesday. The latest production numbers showed that product demand is returning in the US. That seemed to shift investors from wanting to hold the dollar as a safe haven to selling it and re-investing in production assets. Just ahead of the long weekend emerging currencies like the Russian Ruble and Brazilian Real are moving higher against the US Dollar.
Grains found follow through support from the stocks and acreage report on Tuesday. USDA dropped corn acreage from nearly 97 million acres to 92.006 million acres. Soybean acres according to USDA are 10% higher than 2019 at 83.825 million acres. Mike Zuzolo, Global Commodity Analytics, pointed out in his midday commentary that USDA left 12 million soybean acres un-planted. Corn stocks were up almost 1% from 2019 to 5.22 billion bushels. Soybeans stocks were 22% lower than 2019 at 1.39 billion bushels. Old crop wheat stocks were 1.04 billion bushels down 3%. Weather will likely now move back to center stage. Forecasts look to be hot and dry to start July.
Thursday’s export data was fairly strong for all grains. China was a less notable buyer, but was still the top destination for sorghum. Corn exports were also a marketing year high at 1,439,900 MT. Mexico and South Korea were the top destinations. Egypt was the top destination for US soybeans taking in over 146,000 MT.
Wednesday’s ethanol production data was also a bullish factor for corn. EIA data showed for the week ending June 26, ethanol production increased 0.8%, or about 7,000 barrels per day (b/d), to 900,000 b/d. That is nearly 70% higher than it was 9 weeks ago, but is still 16.6% behind a year ago. Ethanol stocks continue to shrink for the tenth consecutive week. Ethanol stocks were down 4.1% to 20.2 million barrels and 11.7% below year-ago volumes. Inventories tightened across all regions and are at their lowest level since the first week of 2017.
The first of July is also the starting day for the new USMCA trade agreement. This could help boost North American demand for ag commodities. There are still a few tensions between the three trade partners like Mexican labor standards or Canadian protection of dairy.
USDA announced to flash sales on Thursday. For the 20/21 marketing year China bought 202,000 MT of corn and 126,000 MT of soybeans.
Weather is also still a lurking bull market maker. With most of the fall crops getting planted earlier than usual this year, a hot and dry July would not be good. Analyst believe though the crop is still looking fairly strong as farmer buying to cover forward contracts doesn’t seem to be happening yet. If the crop starts to burn up and farmers believe they can’t fulfill forward contracts that could bring farmer buying. Overall that scenario would create major momentum to the upside.
On Monday the weekly export inspections report from USDA showed corn, wheat and sorghum all making the needed number to meet USDA export expectations.
Livestock were broadly moving higher until the stocks and acreage report. That is when corn cattle spreads starting unwinding. Tuesday the selling hit cattle again, but midday profit started being taken and that helped cattle close in the green. Analyst are not confident that cattle can keep the momentum for Thursday. Lean hogs broke below $45 on the July contract. That continues to put more technical pressure on lean hogs. There is also continued news reports from China that another virus may be emerging that impacts the hog herd. This comes as African Swine Fever is still active in China and impacting hog numbers. Lean hogs saw limited buying throughout the day. Grilling looks to be a go for many this Independence day. That could bring some late week support for livestock.
A light to moderate trade developed Wednesday. Southern live deals were at $95, roughly $1 lower than last week’s weighted averages. Northern dressed trade occurred at $153 to $155, generally steady with Monday and Tuesday’s trade. Some asking prices remain firm around $98 plus on a live basis, and $158 dressed.
