“This (pandemic) has not kept you from calving and it will not keep you from seeding. When calves are fat and the crops are off Agribition will be here, we will be ready”
The biggest cattle show in Canada will go ahead this fall.
The announcement was made on Twitter in an open letter to the Agribition Family.
“Canadian Western Agribition will celebrate its 50th show this year,” said the Twitter message. “For half a century Agribition has withstood recessions, droughts, washouts, booms, busts, BSE, trade wars, price wars, early frosts and late harvests. Like you we have seen it all.
“This (pandemic) has not kept you from calving and it will not keep you from seeding. When calves are fat and the crops are off Agribition will be here, we will be ready.”
The show is scheduled for Nov. 30 to Dec. 5 at Evraz Place in Regina — the week after the Grey Cup.
Meanwhile, organizers of the Grey Cup with the Saskatchewan Roughriders are working on plans but have not declared that the cup game will proceed.
The Canada Farm Show, also known as the Farm Progress Show, has postponed its June 16-28 show at Evraz Place. No new date has been announced.
