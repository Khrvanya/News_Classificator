After several weeks of sharp rises, GB deadweight cattle prices were largely steady this week. In the week ending 27 June, the all-prime average was steady at £3.61/kg. Steer prices recorded some modest declines, while heifer prices recorded some small increases.
Although industry reports indicate demand has been strong, they also suggest the supply of finished cattle for kill in the coming weeks is plentiful. Much will rest upon how many animals are killed in Ireland, where processors appear to be operating at closer to full capacity again. The estimated GB cattle kill remains significantly above year earlier levels, at 34,300 head in the week ending 27 June.
Cull cow prices have remained strong this week. The overall cow prices increased just over a penny, to £2.61/kg. Estimated cow kill for the week totalled 10,800 head, down 1,000 head week-on-week but above year earlier levels.
