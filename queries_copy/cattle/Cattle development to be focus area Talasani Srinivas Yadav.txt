Hyderabad: For promoting dairy development, Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav directed the officials to focus on development of quality livestock in the State. He asked them to prepare fresh estimations for distribution of cattle to eligible farmers under cattle distribution scheme and ensure additional income to farmers.
In review meeting here on Saturday, Srinivas Yadav emphasised the need to promote and associate cattle rearing with agriculture. He pointed out that the government has been distributing cattle and also providing an additional Rs 4 per litre incentive for milk producers in the State. “Farmers who are striving to turn agriculture profitable, can earn additional income through with cattle rearing,” he said, adding that the State government was making all efforts to meet the milk demand in the State without importing from neighbouring States.
The Minister instructed the officials to appoint full-fledged District Livestock Development Committees in 32 districts across the State at the earliest. Besides preparing a calendar to take up promotional and development activities for cattle, he also directed the officials not to commit mistakes of the previous governments in the State and instead, ensure profits to dairy farmers.
