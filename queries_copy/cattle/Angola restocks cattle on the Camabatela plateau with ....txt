The government of Angola plans to spend US$100 million on the purchase of cattle for restocking livestock on the Camabatela plateau, a region that covers part of the provinces of Kwanza Norte, UÃ­ge and Malanje, said an official from Veterinary Service Institute (ISV).
Henrique Gimi, deputy director-general for the technical area of the ISV, told the Angop news agency that that figure is the value of a debt taken on by Chad from Angola and that will be repaid by providing the cattle.
Under the terms of the agreement reached, Chad will provide Angola, for a period of ten years, with 75,000 head of cattle, and the first lot consisting of 4,500 animals is due to arrive at the Camabatela plateau at the end of this month.
In addition to the US$100 million mentioned, the United Kingdom will provide estimated funding of US$72 million for the repopulation of the plateau.
This funding includes the construction of facilities for hosting trade fairs to auction livestock and technical support to farmers and livestock breeders in the region.
The Camabatela plateau has an area of 1.41 million hectares and includes 11 municipalities in those three provinces. (Macauhub)
