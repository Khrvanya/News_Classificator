Thanks to positive data from the May jobs report and U.S. retail sales, along with rumors about a second round of stimulus checks , investors may be tempted to adopt a risk-on mindset. However, many in Washington are worried about mass-scale costs. As well, not everything about the economy is encouraging, as Wall Street’s latest selloff demonstrated. Therefore, you shouldn’t give up on cash-rich stocks just yet.
While no one will criticize sharply rising growth metrics, cash flow represents a business’ lifeblood. A weakened cash position can lead to severe problems further down the road, even with strong growth. No matter how viable an organization, it must find a way to keep the lights on. That’s why some of the best investments also feature consistent free cash flow.
Another reason to look at a company’s money outflows as opposed to strictly its income statement is flexibility. Simply put, well-financed operations have more options. They can choose to put money to work through key investments, or to expand operations.
As I alluded to above, these attributes have never been more important. With the novel coronavirus impacting every corner of the global markets and now social unrest clouding the domestic picture, stability should command a premium. In this environment, cash cows offer a measure of confidence, especially if we suffer a prolonged recession. Unfortunately, this is still in the cards.
