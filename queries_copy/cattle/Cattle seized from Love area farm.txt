A spokesperson for Animal Protection Services of Saskatchewan (APSS) has confirmed a farm in the Love area is the subject of an animal welfare investigation.
On April 2, officers from APSS, under authority of a search warrant, went to the property and found a number of cattle in distress. According to an email statement from Executive Director Don Ferguson, a total of 107 cattle were seized and taken into protective custody.
No charges have been laid at this time.
While the investigation is ultimately handled by APSS, the ultimate decision to lay charges falls under RCMP jurisdiction.
According to the Animal Protection Act (2018), an animal may be deemed in distress for a number of reasons including being deprived of food, water, shelter or veterinary attention. The animal may also be deemed in distress if kept in unsanitary conditions, or has been found suffering from abuse or neglect.
