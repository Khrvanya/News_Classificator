Why is McDonald’s Passionate About Sustainability?
The beef sector is faced with a dilemma of reducing each animal's environmental farm-to-fork 'hoofprint', while making sure no sacrifice is made to the quantity or quality of beef.  This dilemma stems from a growing world population and increasing affluence which is driving demand for red meats and animal proteins.
To be more sustainable, beef production needs to address the 3 Es:
Environment – it's where we live, our surroundings and our ultimate source of life – through the air we breathe, the water we drink the food we eat, and the raw materials we consume.
Ethics – it provides a framework for critical analysis of the values, attitudes and reasons underlying the decisions we make every day that affect people and animals.
Economics – More than just profits. It is the way society assigns, creates and exchanges value.
