Cattle County Adventure Park will reopen on Saturday, July 4, with reduced entry prices.
However, initially the park will only be open from Wednesday to Sunday – and all tickets must be booked online.
The adventure park, which is based in Berkeley , says that to reflect the shorter opening hours, and the limited number of activities it can offer, entry prices will be reduced.
A statement on the Cattle Country's Facebook page, said: “Our outdoor areas will be the first to reopen; including our castle, adventure playground, beach barn, farm trails, animal experience barn and mini golf as well as our new cafe GRAZE which will be serving delicious locally-sourced food.
“To begin with, Cattle Country will be open from Wednesday to Sunday each week and you will be able to book either a morning or afternoon visit. All tickets must be booked online, this includes Season Ticket holders.
“To reflect the shorter opening hours and number of activities that we are currently able to offer, and cover the daily running costs of the park, we are reducing our opening entry prices too.
“Over the coming weeks we will continue to review our opening times, prices, days and activities and will open outdoor and indoor play equipment as soon as we can, in line with Government guidelines.
