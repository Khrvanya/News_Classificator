Cattle egrets, an uncommon sight in the Ogle-Lee county region, forage for bugs among a herd of cattle just south of Grand Detour at the end of May. About 15 egrets were hanging out with the herd when this photo was taken, but were gone the next day.
Cattle egrets are native to Africa, but somehow reached northeastern South America in 1877 and the United States in 1941; they have since beoame one of the most abundant of the North American herons.
Cattle egrets have shorter legs and necks than other species because they spend most of their time in fields rather than streams, foraging at the feet of grazing cattle, and sometimes riding on their backs to pick at ticks. They follow large animals, or even tractors, eating bugs stirred up from the ground.

Do you think the new Ogle County Jail should be located in downtown Oregon?
