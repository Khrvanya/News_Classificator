Cattle roam the interstate after a semi-truck overturned, releasing a herd of animals on Interstate 72.
ARGENTA  — Police shut down both east and westbound lanes of Interstate 72 at the Argenta exit Sunday after after a semi-truck overturned, releasing a herd of more than 100 panicked cattle onto the highway.
The rollover accident happened just after 1 p.m. and State Police said the round-up of the animals took most of the afternoon. By 6:30 p.m. the eastbound lanes were back open but westbound remain closed as police coordinated the removal of equipment and vehicles brought in to corral the cattle.

“The animals were loose on the east and westbound lanes and that is why the interstate was shut down," said State Trooper Joseph Rush based out of the District 10 regional police headquarters.
Rush said he understood that more than one of the 113 cattle on board the truck had died in the crash, adding to the clean-up problems. Livestock experts had been brought in to assist with the round-up of the surviving animals, some of which had scattered off into nearby fields while others were seen by motorists trotting down the sides of the interstate.

The 34-year-old truck driver, from Enterprise, W. Va., was unhurt and later ticketed for improper lane usage and failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident. Rush said the driver had been westbound around 1:14 p.m. when his vehicle left the road and plowed into the median before overturning.
Rush said didn't know if any injured cattle had been euthanized. The long-term fate of the rounded-up bovine survivors probably isn’t so rosy, however. “I don’t know where they were going but, if I had to guess, I would have to say they were probably headed for slaughter somewhere,” said Rush.
