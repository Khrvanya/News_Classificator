Three lifeguards at the Copper Sky Multigenerational Recreation Complex have tested positive for coronavirus.
None of the lifeguards have worked since June 20, according to the City, which issued a news release on Monday night.
“We do not believe the affected staff came in close contact without taking appropriate precautions with any of the public during any potential shift where they may have had COVID-19,” said Nathan Ullyot, community services director for the city. “Copper Sky Aquatic staff have taken great care to provide aquatic services within the state, federal and CDC guidelines for pool operation.”
City staff have been following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for public pools, which includes physical distancing, wearing face coverings where possible, performing daily temperature checks, and staying home when exhibiting any symptoms, the city noted in its announcement.
In addition, the city said, Copper Sky initiated several protocols to limit the spread of COVID-19 to the public including capping pool capacity to 100 people, expanding the pool deck area into the adjacent lawn to allow for further physical distancing, spacing pool deck furniture around the deck area and removing furniture to limit gatherings and operating open swim in two-hour periods, allowing 30-minute closures to clean and disinfect the pool area.
Earlier Monday night, the city announced the Copper Sky facility will close for at least 30 days in response to the Gov. Doug Ducey’s new executive order, announced earlier in the day. Members will not be billed for services for July. Additional information will be sent at a later date to members about the impact of the closure.
Open swim at the aquatic center will also be closed for at least 30 days in response to the specific stipulations included in the executive order in regard to public pools, the city said.
