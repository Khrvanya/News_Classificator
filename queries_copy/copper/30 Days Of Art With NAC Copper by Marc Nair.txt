To inspire and uplift readers as the country emerges from the Covid-19 circuit breaker, The Straits Times, supported by the National Arts Council as part of the #SGCultureAnywhere campaign, has commissioned 30 works by local writers and artists on the pandemic and what it will be like when all this is over
In those days of unguarded moments,
of copper wire from false ceilings.
and the absence of birdsong, rolled
had been stripped from the world.
We became borders around ourselves,
said goodbye for missing hours,
may no longer love in the same ways.
Marc Nair, 38, received the 2016 NAC Young Artist Award and has published and edited 12 books of poetry. This poem is inspired by four men who allegedly stole up to $11,000 of copper cables from vacant junior colleges during the circuit breaker.
