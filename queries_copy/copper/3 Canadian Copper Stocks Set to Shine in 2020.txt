3 Canadian Copper Stocks Set to Shine in 2020?
SmallCapPower | January 10, 2020: In a recent base metals comment from Canaccord Genuity, the bank views the environment for industrial commodities, such as copper and iron ore, to be promising in 2020. This is due to two reasons: 1) continued fiscal and monetary stimulus from central banks around the world; and 2) a trade deal being realized between the U.S. and China. Canaccord is expecting central banks throughout the world to remain dovish into 2020 and the U.S. and China to agree to a Phase 2 trade deal, with U.S. President Trump up for re-election in 2020, and President Xi Jinping being motivated by a slowing economy as well as mounting political pressures from Hong Kong. As such, Canaccord sees copper as the preferred commodity to hold in 2020 and has identified three Canadian copper stocks as its top picks for 2020.

Turquoise Hill is an international mining company focused on the operation and further development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in southern Mongolia, which is the Company’s principal and only material mineral resource property. On November 12, 2019, Turquoise Hill Resources announced third-quarter 2019 production for Oyu Tolgoi. Copper production was 28,446 tonnes, and gold production was 25,607 ounces. Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 125,000 to 155,000 tonnes of copper and 230,000 to 240,000 ounces of gold in concentrates for F2019. Mill throughput for 2019 is expected to be approximately 45 million tonnes. Canaccord views a new mining deal with the Government of Mongolia in 2020, and a resolution on mine design and financing issues as major catalyst that could result in a re-weighting of the Turquoise Hill’s share price.
