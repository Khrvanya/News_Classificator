The S&P/ASX 200 index (XJO) finished at 5904 points on Friday, up 1.5% on the day, but down about 0.7% on a week on week basis.
The 86 point gain on Friday was largely attributable to strong performances from the financial sector with all of the big banks making good ground.
Its price-earnings multiple and dividend yield metrics look more enticing than CBA for example, so this may be a company to target for investors who like the sector but are looking outside the banks.
The ASX looks set to start the week with plenty of challenges given Friday’s rout on Wall Street combined with increasing coronavirus cases in the US and Australia.
The ASX SPI200 Futures index is down 91 points at 5757 points, suggesting all of Friday’s gains could be lost.
It was really just the US that rained on the parade on Friday as other markets in the Asia-Pacific region were generally positive.
The Nikkei 225 gained 252 points or 1.1% to close at 22,512 points.
The Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% to close at 2979 points.
The Hang Seng was the only disappointment as it came off nearly 1% or 231 points to close at 24,550 points.
The mood was relatively positive in the UK with the FTSE 100 gaining 0.2% to close at 6159 points.
However, it was a different story in mainland Europe with the DAX falling 88 points or 0.7% to close at 12,089 points.
The CAC 40 was down slightly, closing at 4909 points.
The Dow was in freefall for the whole session on Friday, plunging from the previous day’s close of 25,705 points to 25,015 points, a decline of 730 points or 2.8%.
The hardest hit sector was financials with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and American Express down by 8.6%, 5.5% and 4.5% respectively.
News coming out of Nike was disturbing, prompting a 7.6% decline in the stock.
The NASDAQ was also hard hit as it crashed 2.6% to close at 9757 points.
The S&P 500 didn’t fall quite as sharply but finished down 2.4% to 3009 points.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) reflected the negative sentiment, increasing from about 32 points to a high of more than 36 points before tapering a little as markets closed.
However, a push above 40 points is likely to spook investors.
