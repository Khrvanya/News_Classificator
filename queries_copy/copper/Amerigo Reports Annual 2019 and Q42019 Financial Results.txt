VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb.  19, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Amerigo Resources Ltd. (TSX: ARG) (“Amerigo” or the “Company”) announced financial results for the year 2019.  The Company’s 100% owned operation, Minera Valle Central ("MVC") located near Rancagua, Chile posted an annual net loss of $9.4 million or $0.05 loss per share (“LPS”). Annual net operating cash flow was $9.7 million. The Company’s cash position at year end was $7.2 million.
Annual financial results were negatively impacted by lower metal prices, decreased production from fresh and Cauquenes tailings, and higher tolling and production costs.
“2019 operational and financial results were disappointing. 2020 has kicked off with major external challenges including an extreme water drought in Chile and a depressed copper price. On the positive side, we have made progress identifying concrete areas of opportunity to stabilize plant performance at MVC and our cost structure will benefit from important reductions to the two major components of MVC’s cash cost: power and treatment charges”, said Aurora Davidson, Amerigo’s President and CEO.
Amounts in this news release are reported in U.S. dollars except where indicated otherwise.
2019 net loss was $9.4 million (2018: net income of $10.5 million) due to lower metal prices, lower production from fresh and Cauquenes tailings and higher tolling and production costs.
Annual LPS was $0.05 (2018: earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.06).
The Company generated annual operating cash flow of $9.8 million before changes in non-cash working capital (2018: $27.8 million). Annual net operating cash flow was $9.7 million (2018: $27.2 million).
In Q4-2019 Amerigo returned to profitability with net income of $0.6 million (Q4-2018: $5.1 million), $nil EPS (Q4-2018: $0.03) and net operating cash flow of $6.9 million (Q4-2018: $7.8 million). Tolling and production costs in Q4-2019 included $2.3 million in collective agreement signing bonuses to MVC workers. Normalized net income in Q4-2019 excluding signing bonuses was $2.9 million.
MVC produced 69.8 million pounds of copper (2018: 65.0 million pounds) at a cash cost of $1.82/lb ($1.56/lb)
2019 production was 69.8 million pounds of copper (2018: 65.0 million pounds), including 38.9 million pounds from Cauquenes (2018: 43.7 million pounds), 19.3 million pounds from fresh tailings (2018: 21.3 million pounds) and 11.6 million pounds from slag processing (2018: nil).
Molybdenum production was 1.4 million pounds (2018: 1.9 million pounds).
Cash cost (a non-GAAP measure equal to the aggregate of smelting and refining charges, tolling/production costs net of inventory adjustments and administration costs, net of by-product credits) increased to $1.82 per pound (“/lb”) (2018: $1.56/lb). In the computation of cash cost, by-product credits include molybdenum and slag processing revenue.
Total cost (a non-GAAP measure equal to the aggregate of cash cost, Codelco’s Division El Teniente (“DET”) notional copper royalties and DET molybdenum royalties of $0.62/lb and depreciation of $0.30/lb) increased to $2.74/lb (2018: $2.47/lb).
MVC’s average copper price in 2019 was $2.73/lb (2018: $2.92/lb)
MVC’s copper price was $2.73/lb (2018: $2.92/lb) and MVC’s molybdenum price was $10.64/lb (2018: $11.84/lb).
Revenue was $119.8 million (2018: $136.8 million), including copper tolling revenue of $103.6 million (2018: $118.4 million), molybdenum revenue of $10.6 million (2018: $18.4 million) and slag processing revenue of $5.5 million (2018: $nil).
Copper tolling revenue is calculated from MVC’s gross value of copper produced of $158.7 million (2018: $188.6 million) and fair value adjustments to settlement receivables of ($0.3 million) (2018: $5.3 million), less notional items including DET royalties of $33.8 million (2018: $41.1 million), smelting and refining of $19.8 million (Q4-2018: $21.5 million) and transportation of $1.8 million (2018: $2.2 million).
MVC’s financial performance is very sensitive to changes in copper prices. At December 31, 2019, MVC’s provisional copper price was $2.76/lb and final prices will be the average London Metal Exchange (“LME”) prices for January ($2.74/lb), February and March 2020. A 10% increase or decrease from the $2.76/lb provisional price would result in a $4.3 million change in copper revenue in 2020 in respect of 2019 production.
Amerigo remains fully leveraged to the price of copper.
MVC refinanced its debt facilities in 2019, debt repayments in the year were $11.3 million
In Q3- 2019, MVC refinanced its debt facilities which included amending principal payments from five remaining semi-annual payments of $11.3 million each to 7 new semi-annual payments of $4.7 million each (payable on March and September) and a final payment of $23.5 million in September 2023. The new debt structure provides additional flexibility to MVC in the current low copper price environment.
In 2019, MVC made debt repayments of $11.3 million, reducing total debt at year end to $55.9 million (December 31, 2018: $66.2 million).
At December 31, 2019, the Company’s cash balance was $7.2 million (December 31, 2018: $21.3 million).
The Company had a $15.1 million working capital deficiency (December 31, 2018: $16.9 million).
The Company expects that it will continue to be able to meet obligations for the next 12 months from operating cash flows, assuming copper prices in 2020 average at least $2.60/lb and the Company’s 2020 production and cost outlook is met.
MVC’s production results in 2020 will be heavily influenced by water supply to MVC and by the timing and success rate of MVC’s programs to improve plant performance.
While without any question MVC’s sources of water, most significantly water contained in the DET fresh tailings, have been affected by current severe local drought conditions, there is a changed environment with respect to water usage in Chile. Most mining organizations, including DET, are implementing aggressive plant initiatives to permanently reduce water consumption. In addition to continuing to implement its own projects to improve water recirculation, MVC will also need to adjust its own plant to efficiently operate with higher density fresh tailings on an ongoing basis.
MVC’s 2020 Budget was prepared assuming average 2020 recoveries of 20% for fresh tailings and 37% for Cauquenes tailings and daily processing rates of 112,500 tonnes per day (“TPD”) for fresh tailings and 62,500 TPD for Cauquenes, which would result in annual production of 19.6 million pounds of copper from fresh tailings and 46.2 million pounds of copper for Cauquenes tailings.
However, in response to drought conditions and to prevent operational shutdowns should these continue in 2020, MVC has reduced Cauquenes tonnage processing and currently forecasts to continue to do so through H1-2020. In January Cauquenes tonnage processing averaged 48,267 TPD and fresh tailings processing averaged 119,618 TPD. For the balance of H1-2020, MVC is forecasting processing rates of 125,000 TPD for fresh tailings and 40,000 TPD for Cauquenes (going up to 50,000 TPD for Cauquenes in June if rain levels normalize in April and May, the start of the local rain season). MVC has also faced various stoppages at its plant and at Cauquenes YTD in connection with downtime of one or more of its water thickeners in connection with work carried out to improve water recovery and to adjust the mechanisms to deal with higher density contents.
Under the conditions described above, annual production from fresh tailings and Cauquenes would be approximately 55 to 60 million pounds, excluding any effect from plant optimization initiatives. Cash cost would be $1.87/lb in Q1, $1.65/lb in Q2, $1.51/lb in Q3 and $1.57/lb in Q4, for an annual average of $1.63/lb.
Slag processing was suspended in January 2020 as DET started commissioning its own slag processing plant. Slag production in January was 1.2 million pounds.
