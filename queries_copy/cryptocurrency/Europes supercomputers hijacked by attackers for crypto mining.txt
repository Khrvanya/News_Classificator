At least a dozen supercomputers across Europe have shut down after cyber-attacks tried to take control of them.

Staff said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to restore the system, which had recently installed a pandemic modelling tool.
"We now believe this to be a major issue across the academic community as several computers have been compromised in the UK and elsewhere in Europe," the team said.
The NCSC said: "We are aware of this incident and are providing support.
