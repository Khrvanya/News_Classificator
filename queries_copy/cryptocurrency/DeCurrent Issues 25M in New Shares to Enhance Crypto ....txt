IIJ now holds 30 percent of the crypto exchange platform.
DeCurrent, a major Japanese crypto exchange, has increased its capital by 2.75 billion yen (around $25 million) by allocating new shares.
Announced on Monday, the step was taken to improve the existing digital currency trading services on the platform, along with plans to expand its services.
“Amidst a growing major trend towards the spread of digital currency, the Company, which aims to become a “main bank of digital currency,” plans to use the proceeds of the capital increase not only to enhance transaction services for existing virtual currencies (crypto assets) but also to develop and to promote the business for the expansion of digital currency and settlement services,” the Japanese exchange stated.
This fresh share placement has increased the stake of Internet Initiative Japan (IIJ), the largest shareholder of the exchange, to 30 percent. The other 70 percent of the company stock is being held by other existing corporate shareholders.
The announcement also detailed that a total number of 13,770 fresh “non-voting” shares have been issued.
