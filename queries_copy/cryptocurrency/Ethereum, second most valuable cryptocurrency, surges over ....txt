Ethereum, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency has done far better than almost any other financial asset over the past weeks.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has done far better than almost any other financial asset over the past weeks. Since the March 13, 2020 price level of $106, Ethereum now costs $200, a gain of over 88%.
According to data from Coinmarketcap, Ethereum, the second-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, had a value of $22.4 billion and a daily trading volume that stood at about $14.4 billion, at the time of drafting this report.
Meanwhile, the much-awaited Ethereum upgrade, known as Ehereum 2.0, could potentially boost its present bullish trend.
Ethereum 2.0 stands for a fundamental shift in its original designed structure, from the proof-of-work model to an upgrade known as a proof-of-stake model.
Lately, Ethereum Foundation researcher, Justin Drake, wrote on Twitter about Ethereum being long overdue for an upgrade. He said, “Ethereum 2.0 could have been launched a year or two sooner had the team decided to make things easier for themselves, e.g. by going through fewer design iterations.”
We made Eth2 hard for ourselves:
We could have launched a year or two earlier the easy way. It was painful but it was right. Our investments will pay off for decades
