TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Tokyo shares rose sharply Thursday, lifting the Nikkei and Topix indexes for a fourth straight day to a fresh three-month high, as continued optimism for a global economic revival boosted market sentiment.
The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average ended up 497.08 points, or 2.32 percent, from Wednesday at 21,916.31, the highest close since Feb. 27. The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished 27.87 points, or 1.80 percent, higher at 1,577.34, the highest since Feb. 26.
Gainers were led by iron and steel, bank and transportation equipment issues.
In the currency market, improved investor sentiment helped the U.S. dollar to hold firm against the yen. At 5 p.m., the U.S. unit fetched 107.82-83 yen compared with 107.66-76 yen in New York and 107.52-53 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Wednesday.
The euro was quoted at $1.1004-1006 and 118.65-69 yen against $1.1003-1013 and 118.56-66 yen in New York and $1.0964-0965 and 117.89-93 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday afternoon.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was flat from the previous day's close at minus 0.005 percent, with the safe asset caught between buying on caution against additional waves of COVID-19 infection and selling on upbeat Tokyo shares.
The prevailing market optimism allayed concerns about deteriorating U.S.-China relations, with Washington saying overnight that Hong Kong no longer deserves special U.S. status because of Beijing's new security legislation that is feared will curb the territory's autonomy.
Combined with a U.S. bill that passed the same day condemning Beijing's treatment of Muslim minorities, the development could pose a downside risk to financial markets in the near future, said Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
"With shares hovering at such a high range, many investors are weighing when to sell, and the U.S.-China factor could trigger a slip," he said.
Brokers also attributed the gains to the Cabinet approval Wednesday of a 31.91 trillion yen ($296 billion) second supplementary budget for the fiscal year through next March to cushion the economic damage from the pandemic -- the largest-ever amount for an extra budget in Japan.
Banks were one of the gainers on expectations that moves to reactivate a broad range of businesses will improve their business environment.
On the First Section, advancing issues outnumbered decliners 1,530 to 583, while 53 ended unchanged.
Dentsu Group surged 422 yen, or 16.4 percent, to 2,993 yen after reporting Wednesday it booked a net profit of 15.36 billion yen in the January-March quarter, returning to the black from a loss of 2.58 billion yen the previous year.
Nissan soared 33.90 yen, or 8.2 percent, to 449.40 yen and Mitsubishi Motors spiked 20 yen, or 6.4 percent, to 334 yen, a day after announcing the two Japanese automakers and Renault will further streamline the three-way alliance's operations to cut costs for new car development by up to 40 percent.
Recruit Holdings advanced 253 yen, or 7.0 percent, to 3,849 yen after its group net profit for the fiscal year ended in March announced the previous day rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier to 179.8 billion yen on revenue of 2.4 trillion yen, up 3.8 percent.
Trading volume on the main section rose to 2,087.53 million shares from Wednesday's 1,763.3 million shares.
