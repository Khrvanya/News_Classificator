ASX 200 & Nikkei 225 Forecast: US-China Tensions Threaten Gains
ASX 200, Nikkei 225, US-China Tensions, COVID-19, Hong Kong – Talking Points:
Political tensions between the U.S. and China threaten bullish momentum
Tensions surrounding China are moving back into the fold, as the COVID-19 pandemic and China’s encroachment into Hong Kong turn the heat back up on relations between the United States and China. Still, investors have shrugged off the renewed headwinds, for now. The ASX 200 index is up nearly 30 percent since getting crushed to its lowest level since 2012 in March . Bulls, however, have slightly favored Japan’s Nikkei 225 index, bidding it 34 percent higher since its March lows.
While the market flashed warning signs in recent weeks - such as the risk-sensitive AUD/USD selling off at its March 9 resistance level on Wednesday. Bulls in both equity and forex markets have yet to capitulate to macro themes surrounding the increasing tensions between Hong Kong and China, an issue that may begin to dictate the more prominent US-China relationship.
On the other hand, market bulls are hardly driving prices higher on blind enthusiasm. Monetary efforts from Australia and Japan have been aggressive considering the COVID-19 pandemic. The RBA lowered its cash rate to 0.25%, a record low for the bank. Meanwhile, the BOJ continues its aggressive bond buying program. On the fiscal side, Japan most recently bolstered its fiscal response, with the country approving a new $1.1 trillion stimulus package on Wednesday.
