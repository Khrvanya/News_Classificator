Tokyo stocks closed lower on Wednesday as investors cashed in after the key Nikkei index soared nearly five percent in the previous session.
The Nikkei 225 lost 0.56 percent, or 126.45 points, to end at 22,455.76, while the broader Topix index fell 0.40 percent, or 6.36 points, to 1,587.09.
"Traders were in wait-and-see mode in the afternoon session with no clear direction," said Okasan Online Securities, adding that profit-taking had dominated the market following sharp rallies in the day before.
Tokyo shares spiked in Tuesday trading on a report the US was preparing a sizable infrastructure proposal, brokers said.
After active buying in the previous session, however, "concerns over a second wave of coronavirus infection are returning", said Okasan's chief strategist Yoshihiro Ito.
Just minutes before the opening bell, Japan released data showing the devastating effect of the coronavirus on its trade.
