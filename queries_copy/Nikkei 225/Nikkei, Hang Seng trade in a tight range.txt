Asian markets were in a tight range on Friday after a mixed Wall Street session and as investors awaited key U.S. jobs data while sustained hopes about a global economic recovery kept pressure on the safe-haven dollar.
The week's global equity rally lost some steam on Thursday as traders took winnings from seven days of gains, backing away ahead of Friday's nonfarm payrolls data, which is expected to show further deterioration in the U.S. jobs market.
Japan’s Nikkei declined 78.97 points, or 0.35 per cent to 22,616.77, while Hang Seng index was a tad up at 24,369.89.
The dollar index fell 0.6%, with the euro up 0.04% to $1.134.
