Tokyo's benchmark stock index has climbed to its highest level in three and a half months.
On Monday, the Nikkei 225 closed at 23,178, up 314 points from Friday. It has now rallied for six straight trading days.
This is the first time the index has topped 23,000 points since February 21, before global share prices began record plunges due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The TOPIX index of all first-section issues gained 18 points to 1,630.
A market analyst says optimism over the global economic outlook is spreading due to government and central bank stimulus measures, as well as better-than-expected US jobs data last week.
But the analyst also says share prices are going up at a faster pace than anticipated, which means some investors could soon be looking to take their profits.
