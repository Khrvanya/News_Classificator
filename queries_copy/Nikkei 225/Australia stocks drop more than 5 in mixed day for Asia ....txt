"I think the data's probably gonna come in ... really bad in Q2 for majority of the global economy," Cedric Chehab, head of country risk and global strategy at Fitch Solutions, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "Although equity markets and financial markets typically bottom before the economy does, it feels a little bit sudden or a little bit quick … for the markets to be bottoming.
"(We're) still seeing a very large increase in the number of COVID-19 cases globally and we really haven't seen … the curve flatten yet," Chehab said.
A surge in reported infections in recent days has made the U.S. the c ountry with the largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases . Globally, more than 531,800 have been infected while at least 24,000 lives have been taken, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University.

Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will not "run out of ammunition" to keep the economy stable.
"We judge markets are pricing‑in a short sharp US recession," Joseph Capurso, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note. "Our fear is the surge in jobless claims – even if the benefits paid will soon be increased – will draw-out the recession longer than markets expect."
