On the daily time frame, we can see that AUDUSD made a lower high after two consecutive higher highs. This chart pattern is what is known in forex trading as a head and shoulders chart pattern. The most recent high being lower than the first two suggests that sellers could be looking to push AUDUSD lower. A break of the neckline, which in this case is around 0.6850, could signal a sell-off in the currency pair. There is near-term support at the rising trend line at 0.6830 from connecting the lows of October 2 and November 29. The price also coincides with the 100 SMA. If support here does not hold, AUDUSD could drop all the way down to its December lows at 0.6755.
On the other hand, a rally above January 16 highs at 0.6930 would invalidate the chart pattern. This could mean that AUDUSD could make a run for its recent highs at 0.7015.
