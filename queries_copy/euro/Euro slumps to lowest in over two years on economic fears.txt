The euro’s slump to start 2020 is gaining momentum amid growing concern that Germany could be headed for recession because of the lingering effects on the global economy from the coronavirus.
The common currency fell to the weakest since 2017 versus the dollar Wednesday, sinking as much as 0.5 per cent to $1.0865.
On Thursday it hit its lowest level against the Swiss franc since August 2015 as investors sought safe havens after China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, reported a sharp jump in the number of new cases.
The euro briefly fell to 1.0622 Swiss francs, below its 2016 trough of 1.0623, and last stood at as low as 1.06207.
Concern about German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s succession plans and a dovish European Central Bank have weighed on the euro, which investors are looking to as a vehicle to fund riskier positions. The S&P 500 Index rose to a record in New York as the euro sank.
Deutsche Bank now expects a slight contraction for Germany in the fourth quarter as the virus exacerbates an industrial slump. Euro-area industrial output posted the steepest drop in almost four years at the end of 2019, data showed Wednesday.
“The narrative of slowing economic activity is key and today’s industrial production data is key,” said Monex Europe currency analyst Simon Harvey. “Many are suggesting further easing may be on the horizon. Combine this with the easing risk climate, and the euro seems to be suffering as the funding currency.”
