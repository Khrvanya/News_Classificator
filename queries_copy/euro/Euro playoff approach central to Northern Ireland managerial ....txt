Irish FA executives are set to meet on Thursday night to discuss the appointment of Michael O'Neill's successor, with the successful candidate possibly being revealed on Friday.
The new Northern Ireland boss will take charge of the squad for two Nations League fixtures in September before the crucial Euro play-off in Bosnia the following month.
"It's an attractive job, a really attractive proposition to take on a settled squad with players who know how to win games at international level.
"The new manager is two games away from going to a major championships and all five of those interviewed have their strengths.  It's just a question of who the panel think can best take the team forward.
"They'll be looking at who can bring their personality across best and who can add to the good position the squad is already in - is it something tactical, is it their personality, just something to make the team better."
The Irish FA has indicated they wish to maintain an element of continuity in making their appointment and four of the five candidates have worked as part of previous manager O'Neill's backroom staff.
Magilton is the IFA's Elite Performance Director, Motherwell manager Robinson was part of the NI coaching team at Euro 2016 and ex-St Johnstone boss Wright was goalkeeping coach during the early part of O'Neill's tenure.
Baraclough is the country's Under-21 manager and has worked closely with O'Neill, while the fifth candidate Sheils is the Northern Ireland women's manager.
"It'll be about who brought themselves across best in front of the panel on Wednesday. Did someone say something, do something differently, present themselves in a different way that the panel members didn't expect," argued Craigan.
"It's unusual to get a job when things are going well. Traditionally you would be going in there and maybe having to convince players to play for Northern Ireland but that hasn't been the case in the last few years."
