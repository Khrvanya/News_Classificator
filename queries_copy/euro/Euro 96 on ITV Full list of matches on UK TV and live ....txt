ITV will show games from Euro 96 this May, starting with England's 1-1 draw against Switzerland at Wembley - the much-anticipated opening game of the competition - on May 11.
After that, the grudge match between 'old enemies' England and Scotland was shown on Sunday May 17 and will be available to watch on the Hub, meaning you are able to take in some Gascoigne magic and the infamous 'Dentist's Chair' .
The evening of Saturday May 23 saw the tense quarter-final clash against Spain and the Three Lions' joyous penalty shootout victory, where Stuart Pearce made up for 1990.
Then, on Thursday May 28 ITV will show the classic semi-final showdown against bitter rivals Germany, featuring the penalty shootout theatrics of Andreas Moller and the heartache of Gareth Southgate.
Finally, if you can bear to stick it, the Euro 96 final between Germany and Czech Republic - who were group-stage opponents - will then be shown on ITV on Friday May 29.
