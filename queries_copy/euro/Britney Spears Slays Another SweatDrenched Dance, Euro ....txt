Britney Spears Slays Another Sweat-Drenched Dance, Euro Model Trashed For Shading Her
Queen of pop Britney Spears gave Instagram another smokeshow on July 1st.
38-year-old Britney wore a black-and-white Calvin Klein sports bra with a tiny pair of green/floral-patterned shorts during the Tuesday video.
It's the same bra she wore during Monday's sweat-drenched dance video, but she'd also told Instagram about having "so much laundry üß∫ to do" ...so it's logical to think the bra was washed.

The thumbnail showed Spears leaping way above her makeshift/all-tile "dance floor," which appears to sit just in front of the living room.
Her 89-second showoff currently sits at almost 3.5 million views...see it here:

Polina Malinovskaya, a model from Belarus , dropped this in the replies: "At least she looks happy‚ù§Ô∏è"
And the Britney Army found it to be a bit shady...so they called her out on it.
"This is horrible," one fan said.
"I wish I was that happy!!!" another told the model.
A third added, "She's living her best life girl, leave her alone ‚ù§Ô∏è" - which became the premise for another thread:
"At first I thought her IG videos were a little out there. But you know what, now I just see a person living their best life, dancing because they want to and not caring what anyone thinks about it."
"And I love that. She hasn't fallen into the trap of trying to have a perfectly curated account or trying to be a clone of everyone else. She's just being her quirky self and that's refreshing. Maybe we're just not used to people being truly real online."
"I 100% AGREE!!üñ§ The Kardashian accounts are sooooo boring. Britney [sic] is REAL and FUN," someone said.
