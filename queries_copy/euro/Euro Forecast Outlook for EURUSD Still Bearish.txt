Last week’s video conference of members of the European Council to discuss the EU’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak again highlighted the slow pace and complexity of decision making by the bloc’s leaders.
Combined with a crash in IHS Markit’s composite purchasing managers’index for the Eurozone in April to 13.5, by far its lowest reading since the survey began in mid-1998, it’s hard to see anything other than a further decline in the Euro .
The latest purchasing managers’ indexes for April, released late last week, were uniformly bad, confirming that the global economy will be hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the PMIs for the Eurozone still stood out as particularly weak, with the composite index for the region down to 13.5 – by far its lowest reading since the survey began in mid-1998 and considerably below all forecasts in a poll by the Reuters news agency.
The data led IHS Markit, which compiles the figures, to comment that they are “indicative of the Eurozone economy contracting at a quarterly rate of approximately 7.5%” and that “the second quarter looks set to record the fiercest downturn the region has seen in recent history”.
If confirmation were needed, it came from the GfK measure of German consumer confidence, which plummeted to minus 23.4 from a positive 2.3 the month before; way below the forecast -1.7.
Against this background, it was no surprise that EUR/USD continued to slide lower and there are no signs yet that the coming week will see a reversal of the trend unless there is an unexpected burst of market optimism that sparks a flight from the relative safety of the USD into riskier currencies like the EUR.
