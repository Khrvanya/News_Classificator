The bitcoin analyst known as PlanB revealed an update to the bitcoin stock-to-flow model last ... [+] night--suggesting bitcoin could be about to soar toward $100,000 per bitcoin in the next few months.
Others have also suggested a "fourth crypto cycle" could be on the horizonâ€”signalling the end of the third crypto winter and kicking of a cycle that begins with the bitcoin price rising.
"The 2017 cycle spawned dozens of exciting projects in a wide range of areas including payments, finance, games, infrastructure, and web apps," Andreessen Horowitz partners Chris Dixon and Eddy Lazzarin wrote in a blog post last month.
"Many of these projects are launching in the near future, possibly driving a fourth crypto cycle."
Elsewhere, co-founder of social news aggregation site Reddit and early investor in major U.S. bitcoin and crypto exchange Coinbase, Alexis Ohanian, has said he sees the green shoots of a new bitcoin and "crypto spring."

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
