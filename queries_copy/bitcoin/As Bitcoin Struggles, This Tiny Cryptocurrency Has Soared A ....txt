The omiseGo price has soared by 234% in just a month as investors cheer its new Coinbase listing.
The likes of bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have also failed to return to their all-time highs, with the bitcoin price now trading around half its December 2017 high.
Some smaller cryptocurrencies, such as chainlink and tezos , have rallied hard in recent months, however, pushed higher by demand for decentralized finance platforms.
Meanwhile, the broader bitcoin and cryptocurrency market is closely-watching for price swings after bitcoin went through a supply squeeze earlier this month.
The number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, called miners, was cut by half, dropping from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25 on May 11.
Some had warned the bitcoin price could crash in the aftermath of the third halving but most analysts seem confident the bitcoin price will climb eventually.

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
