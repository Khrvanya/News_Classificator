Last week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared a graph of user activity on the cryptocurrency exchange platform that indicated more transactions were being made of exactly $1,200.
Additionally, a representative from Binance US told CoinDesk a similar story regarding $1,200 transactions on Monday.
The buying of Bitcoin directly with stimulus money is something to behold, as the general investment thesis around the crypto asset is at least partially based on the idea that out-of-control, debt-based spending will eventually lead to fiat currency devaluations. Indeed, using a stimulus check to buy Bitcoin could be viewed as a sort of protest of the current state of the global financial system.
As one Reddit user put it , “Putting an inflationary currency into a deflationary currency, what a novel idea.”

I created http://thecryptofeed.net, which is intended to be the front page of Bitcoin and online privacy news on the internet. I'm also a longtime Bitcoin writer who has worked all over the Bitcoin media space—from being editor-in-chief at Inside Bitcoins to contributing to Bitcoin Magazine on a regular basis. My work has also been featured in Business Insider, VICE Motherboard, Wired UK, and many other financial and tech media outlets. I'm mostly interested in the use of Bitcoin for transactions that would be censored by the traditional financial system (think darknet markets and ransomware) in addition to the use of bitcoin as an unseizable, digital store of value. Altcoins, appcoins, and ICOs don't make much sense to me. Find all of my work at kyletorpey.com. Disclosure: I hold some bitcoin.
