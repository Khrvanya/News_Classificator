The bitcoin price has slumped since last year with early signs of another bitcoin bull run halted by ... [+] the coronavirus crash in March.
Back's latest bitcoin price prediction comes as Donald Trump's administration weighs another massive round of stimulus measures—potentially adding a further $1 trillion.
Already this year the U.S. has signed off on $3.5 trillion in relief measures to combat the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns put in place to contain the virus.
The stimulus measures, as well as the Fed moving to backstop financial markets, have meant stocks and shares resumed their march higher after a historic crash in March.
Bitcoin has also rebounded but has failed to breach recent highs set in February.
Bitcoin has been put further into contrast with fiat currency by a supply squeeze last month, which saw the number of bitcoin rewarded to those that maintain the bitcoin network, called miners, cut by half—dropping from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25.

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
