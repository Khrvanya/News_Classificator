However, concerns persist over the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. At least 12 states have postponed or scaled back planned reopenings due to rising infections.
“We continue to expect [the recovery] to be an uneven process, albeit with a positive trajectory,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services. “The good news is through this digestion period, markets are working off some of the excesses that had built up, and elevated expectations are being reset.”
Katerina Simonetti, senior portfolio manager at UBS Private Wealth Management in Philadelphia, said: “Although we expect some level of recovery in 2021, we don’t think corporate profits will recover to levels reached in 2019 until 2022. In our base case we expect S&P 500 to be trading around 3,300 by December 2020.”
Simonetti noted that the recent increase in the numbers of reported COVID-19 cases has resulted in considerable market uncertainty. “Further market decline cannot be ruled out,” she added.
“We feel like a lot of the good news is priced in,” Jim McDonald , chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. “The market’s got some optimism that we are going to see more of a V-shaped recovery, so there is risk of some modest disappointment.”
