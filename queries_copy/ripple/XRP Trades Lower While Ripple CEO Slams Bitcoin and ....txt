XRP , the token associated with the California-based fintech firm Ripple, is down 1% today, while other major coins dropped 1%-4% today, despite good news from India .
At pixel time (13:00 UTC), XRP trades at c. USD 0.233 and is also down 4.9% in a week, increasing its monthly losses to 7.5%. The price is down 25% in a year.
Shortly after, however, feedback started to pour in from the Bitcoin community, with the Bitcoin evangelist at Kraken , Pierre Rochard, responding sarcastically that “XRP wastes far more electricity than BTC, if you look up the definition of waste.”
The monthly selling of XRP in the market has frequently been criticized in the community and is believed to be a major reason for why XRP is still down by more than 90% from its all-time high in early 2018. However, there is hope for the situation to improve after Ripple announced in January that it had slashed its XRP sales after raising USD 200 million in new funding.
