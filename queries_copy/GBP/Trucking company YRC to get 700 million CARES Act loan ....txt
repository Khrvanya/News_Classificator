Trucking company YRC to get $700 million CARES Act loan, stock rockets 75% premarket
Shares of trucking company YRC Worldwide rocketed 75% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company said it expects to receive a $700 million CARES Act loan from the U.S. Treasury. “YRCW and its operating companies Holland, New Penn, Reddaway, and YRC Freight have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the company said in a statement. The companies employ 30,000 drivers, including 24,000 members of the Teamsters union, it said. The company will use the funds from the bailout plan to pay healthcare and pension costs and meet other contractual obligations and to support essential capital investment. In return for the loan, the U.S. Treasury will receive a 29.6% equity stake in the company. Shares have fallen 27% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 has fallen 4%.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.
