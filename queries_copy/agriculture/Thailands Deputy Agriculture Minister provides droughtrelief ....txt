A Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives is delivering poultry to farmers affected by droughts in Maha Sarakham province, hoping the birds will generate income for the farmers.
According to a story in Newsline and the National News Bureau of Thailand , Praphat Phothasoothon met with local farmers and supplied them with live poultry. The birds will be used as breeding stock that will start new growing operations, creating a separate stream of income as the dry season persists.
The deliveries are part of a recovery scheme that has been introduced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The scheme hopes to shore up the incomes of farmers affected by Thailandâ€™s flood disaster earlier in 2020.
4,886 farmers in Maha Sarakham who have joined this scheme opted to receive the support being offered to create their animal farms. The delivery of live poultry from the Deputy Minister of Agriculture was part of this scheme, delivering the animal as well as other farm supplies to 134 farmers in Chiang Yuen district.
