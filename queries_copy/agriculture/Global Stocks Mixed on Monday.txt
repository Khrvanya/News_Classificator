BEIJING (AP) -- Global stocks were mixed Monday as investors looked past dismal American jobs and other data toward hopes for a global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
European markets opened down while most Asian markets advanced. Wall Street futures swung between gains and losses.
U.S. shares gained Friday despite a government report that American employers cut a record-setting 20.5 million jobs in April.
Investor optimism is gaining as China and some other countries begin to revive their economies. But with infection numbers still rising in the United States, Brazil and some other countries, analysts warn a global recovery might be some way off.
"While the argument that forward-looking market hopes of recovery should override backward looking economic gloom may not be groundless, it inevitably understates inherent fragilities and risks," Riki Ogawa of Mizuho Bank said in a report.

Investors hoping for reassurance were looking ahead to an appearance by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.
"He is certainly not going to walk back any of the Fed extraordinary stimulus measures," said Stephen Inness of AxiTrader in a report. "If anything, he could lay it down even thicker."
