“We are expecting to see nearly 55% coverage in the Corn Belt the next five days but, as usual this time of year, the rain amounts will vary greatly,” he says.
“Yesterday most of the row crop markets saw their technical support levels tested with the favorable precip forecast and we will likely see these technical support levels hold until the USDA’s crop report Tuesday,” he said earlier on Friday. “Following Tuesday’s report, the market action will be hinged closely on the daily weather forecast once again.”

After this week’s downturn in corn futures, Al Kluis of Kluis Commodity Advisors says, “If the weather forecast over the next week occurs as suggested, the bulls will have a hard time getting prices to rally. The USDA report on Tuesday may be the last chance the bulls have at a catalyst for a rally. Traders are tired of waiting for China to step in and buy U.S. corn.”
He’s also watching ethanol demand.
“Ethanol prices fell over a dime on Thursday as analysts start to estimate the continued impact that COVID-19 will have on demand. Will we see buyers step in and buy the dip, or will the selling gain momentum?”
On Thursday, the CME Group’s farm markets mostly lower.

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors will be watching weather forecasts going forward.
“Estimates are being discussed daily about the USDA Acreage report this coming Tuesday. Many predictions suggest an increase in soybean acres of more than 1 million acres while corn acres decline. Traders are also watching the forecasts; weather models are suggesting that dry areas in the Corn Belt will get much-needed moisture over the next seven days,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “This is the time of year when grain prices can have a quick reaction to a miss by the weather models. If the rain events forecast for the next week do not unfold, then the bulls could get the spark they have been waiting for.”

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that next week’s USDA Acreage Report is coming into focus.
“The average trade estimates for next week’s USDA Acreage report are suggesting a lot more soybean acres and less corn, but those projections may be wrong. Most farmers planted the corn acres they intended to plant,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “The Energy Information Agency report comes out today. Expect another week when gasoline and ethanol demand move higher and crude oil, gasoline, and ethanol inventories move lower. The economy is opening up. With fewer U.S. consumers flying to their favorite vacation spot, more are driving.”

The marketing year for soybeans began September 1.
Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors will be watching for clarification on the U.S.-China trade deal.
“White House advisor Navarro said yesterday afternoon that the Trump administration was going to walk away from the Phase 1 trade deal, which initially caused stock and commodity prices to plunge. However, by 9 p.m., he had walked away from that comment. This created some large swings in the overnight stock futures and the grain markets,” Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, “The buying spree by China is just starting. China has assured the U.S. Trade Office that it will make good on buying the $36.1 billion worth of ag products called for in the Phase 1 agreement. This suggests huge purchases of corn, soybeans, ethanol, and pork in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. At the current futures price and with the weak U.S. dollar, this is a great long-term buy.”

Al Kluis, Kluis Advisors, says that investors will be eyeing today's Crop Progress Report.
"The USDA Crop Progress Report today will show corn conditions down another 1 to 2% (at 68 or 69%) good to excellent and the soybean ratings will also decline by about 1%. The survey was taken late last week ahead of the recent rain across the Corn Belt. The good areas cannot get much better and dry areas in the southwest Corn Belt, Illinois and Indiana will move lower," Kluis told customers in a daily note.
Kluis added, "Watch the extended weather forecasts for Kansas, Colorado, Texas, and also in the eastern Corn Belt in Illinois and Indiana. Those key states have missed much of the recent rain and crop conditions have been moving lower in those areas."
