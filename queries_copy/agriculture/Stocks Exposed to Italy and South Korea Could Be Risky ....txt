Stocks Exposed to Italy and South Korea Could Be Risky. Here are 22.
Updated March 9, 2020 / Original February 25, 2020
CNH Industrial, a maker of agricultural equipment, derives 11% of total sales from Italy.
As the coronavirus spreads beyond China, Italy and South Korea are focal points for investors worried about the growing scope of the outbreak. Barron’s dug into U.S.-listed companies with exposure to those two countries.
We looked at all stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges and trade at least 100,000 shares a day, on average. Of those stocks, four were companies that generated at least 10% of 2019 revenue from Italy, where at least 322 people had been confirmed to have contracted the virus and 10 have died as of Tuesday afternoon.
Barron’s found 18 U.S.-listed companies that get at least 10% of revenue from South Korea, where the World Health Organization counts 763 cases and 7 deaths. (The virus is also spreading in Iran, but sanctions limit U.S. companies’ activity there).
Here is a look at the U.S. companies most exposed to Italy and South Korea.
The electronic-gaming equipment and software maker, based in London, gets more than a third of its revenue (37.6%) from Italy. Since the start of the year, the stock has tumbled 18%. Much of that decline came this week, as global indexes slid on virus fears. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.86. For reference, the S&P 500 has a P/E of 20.8.
This Ohio-based company makes power-conveyance and energy-management solutions for vehicles. About 14% of its sales come from Italy. Like IGT, Dana has dropped 18% since the beginning of January. It is trading at 5.2 times earnings.
Italy accounts for 12% of revenue for the apparel company. The stock has fallen 17% this year. With a P/E of 15.9, it is still relatively expensive compared with other U.S. stocks exposed to Italy.
The agricultural-equipment and commercial-vehicle maker, based in London, derives 11% of total sales from Italy. The stock was up slightly on Tuesday amid a sea of red, but it is still down 20% since the start of January. CNH is trading at a P/E of 8.8.
The maker of organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), based in New Jersey, gets 62% of its revenue from Korea. Investors have taken the stock—which gained 126% in 2019—lower by 25% this year. It is trading at a P/E of 53.9.
For the San Jose semiconductor company, South Korea accounts for 52% of sales. The stock has fallen 3% since the start of 2020, a loss that appears contained in part because it has given up 26% over the past 12 months.
The chip company, based in Massachusetts, gets a third of its revenue from South Korea. The stock has dropped 8% this year but is holding on to a 14% gain over the past 12 months. It is trading at 63.4 times earnings.
