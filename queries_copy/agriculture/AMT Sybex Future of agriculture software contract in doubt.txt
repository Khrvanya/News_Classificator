A senior government official has raised doubts about the future of a software contract on which millions of pounds of taxpayers money has already been spent.
It is for a new system to trace animal movements and disease, which is relied on heavily by the agriculture industry.
A Stormont committee was told significant issues had delayed the continued roll-out of the new system and the contract was being reviewed.
The company involved - AMT Sybex - said it was working to resolve the issues.
Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) official Brian Doherty said the existing traceability system, which the new one was meant to replace, remained "fit for purpose".
He said £10.9m had been spent by the department on the new system since April 2016.
Mr Doherty was asked by committee chairman Declan McAleer whether he was confident the obstacles could be overcome and the system implemented.
An £8.7m contract for the Northern Ireland Food Animal Information System (NIFAIS) was awarded to AMT-Sybex in 2016 for a nine-year term.
The first stage of it was implemented in June 2017.
It was meant to replace the existing system Animal Plant Health Information System (APHIS), which has been in use here since 1998.
