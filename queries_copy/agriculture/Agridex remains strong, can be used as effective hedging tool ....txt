India being the major producer, consumer and exporter of most agri items, there can be a good possibility of very high investments in this sector.
The unique initiative undertaken by the exchange NCDEX to launch India's first Agricultural Futures Index has taken the Futures market by storm. A basket of 10 most liquid Agri counters traded in NCDEX across all sectors is taken with proper weightage. This index is traded on the NCDEX platform. Pulses, Guar, Oil complex and fibre are all given due weightage so that no particular sector/commodity may weigh on the sentiments of the Index.
When volumes of individual commodities have remained subdued due to lack of trading activities in the mandis, AGRIDEX has had negligible impact of such factors. The only factor that is important for the index is the overall market sentiment for the Agri sector. Thus, if, for e.g., Chana mandi is closed but other commodity mandis are open, we may find low trading activities and volumes in Chana Futures as a commodity. But trading in Agridex and its volumes will in no case be affected due to that, as other counters move the Index.
The strong positive factors that are expected to push Agridex volumes a great deal is that the 'inherent' fear associated with trading in Agri commodities are not at all present in the Index. Fears of de-listing, quality-related issues, individual counters hitting upper/lower circuit and lack of knowledge of Agri commodities have all been taken care of by this Index. It will not be affected by any of these factors.
