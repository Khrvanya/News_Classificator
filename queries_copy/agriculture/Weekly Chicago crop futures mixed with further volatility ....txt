CHICAGO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures were mixed for the trading week ending June 12 as further volatility tied to the second wave of coronavirus in the United States and the world was set to hit the commodities marketplace.
Traders were advised to act cautiously with world confidence in health and the availability of a vaccine at a low ebb, according to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC). Most experts think the development of a COVID-19 vaccine or drug is still nine to 18 months off, according to the ARC.
Corn ended the week near unchanged. Ethanol production margins continued to rise after COVID-19 shutdowns caused a glut of supply. However, spikes in infections across states that re-opened first have curbed U.S. miles driven and future ethanol use.
Fund managers have sold corn amid bearish fundamentals. ARC's corn outlook is decidedly bearish.
Wheat ended lower. The United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service surprised the industry by raising U.S. estimated winter wheat production by 11 million bushels. Warmth and dryness across the U.S. Plains is rapidly advancing the harvest.
Chicago-based agricultural research firm AgResource sees wheat as caught in a wide range trade of 4.40 to 4.90 dollars into early 2021.
Soybeans held a narrow range but marked their best finish in 11 weeks. The week's main event, the June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, did not offer any major surprises for the crop. AgResource said there is no reason to think the U.S. soybean yield won't at least reach or exceed USDA's forecast of 49.8 bushels per acre (BPA).
With favorable growing season weather, AgResource estimates the national yield could reach 52 to 54 BPA with normal August weather. Enditem
