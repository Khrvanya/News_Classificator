Northern Michigan’s Small Farm Conference: Camaraderie in Agriculture
Growers from across the state are meeting up in Acme this week to share the latest tips and tools with each other.
The Northern Michigan Small Farm Conference is chance for gardeners and small producers to take a deeper dive into specialized topics.
They’re hosting a hemp and maple syrup school and programs that range from farm finance to flowers and fertilizing.
John Hooper, a member of the Michigan Organic Food Farm Alliance, says it’s a great opportunity for camaraderie in the agriculture community, especially those who have small farms.
“It’s not conventional agriculture, it’s not 1000 acres, it’s people that are growing, where they’re hands-on. It’s growing food for the local community as opposed to being international or national distributor,” he says.
