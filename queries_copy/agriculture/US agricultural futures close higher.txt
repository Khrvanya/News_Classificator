CHICAGO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed higher on Thursday with corn, wheat and soybeans all rising.
The most active corn contract for July delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.38 percent, to close at 3.26 U.S. dollars per bushel. July wheat edged up 1 cent, or 0.18 percent, to settle at 5.4475 dollars per bushel. July soybeans climbed 4.25 cents, or 0.5 percent, to end at 8.4675 dollars per bushel.
Through the week ending April 16, exporters sold 29 million bushels of corn, compared with 36 million a week earlier; 13 million bushels of soybeans versus 9 million the previous week; and 9 million bushels of wheat against 7 million the prior week.
For respective crop years to date, the United States has sold 1,393 million bushels of corn, down 22 percent from last year; 1,395 million bushels of soybeans, down 15 percent; and 939 million bushels of wheat, unchanged from mid-April a year ago.
Although ethanol production is finding equilibrium at a time of oversupply as COVID-19 keeps drivers off roads, total domestic corn consumption will be lowered considerably, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) said on Wednesday.
The ARC also said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 2019/20 soy export forecast is still 100 million bushels too high despite sales made to China on Thursday morning.
With weather poised to affect wheat yield potential, a key issue in the market is whether Europe's Black Sea region, which has received disappointing April rains, will see significant precipitation in the next two weeks. Enditem
