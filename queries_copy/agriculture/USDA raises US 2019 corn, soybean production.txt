Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says this was not a market moving report.
“But it does emphasize the fact that demand is rising globally for all grains, and we are using more coarse grains than we are producing for the second consecutive year. There will be questions as to the accuracy of harvested acres and for corn demand from ethanol producers moving forward, but the big question will be what adjustments the USDA will make to assumptions for the February WASDE after the signing of the U.S./China trade deal next week,” Gilbertie says.
Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that investors haven’t made up their minds about whether the report was bearish or bullish.
“It was a mixed report, with U.S. corn and bean production higher instead of lower. Yet, the quarterly stocks data was positive for corn and wheat and not for beans. The world data is kind of positive as well. A very interesting market reaction – makes me wonder if the market was talking bullish and leaning bearish going into the numbers, especially on the corn and to a lesser extent the wheat. Even beans have moved to unchanged, after trading lower after the report. A very interesting reaction,” Scoville says.
Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that the market may have had this negative news dialed in.
“Initial reaction in today’s January USDA Crop Report was negative, with U.S. corn and bean yields increasing slightly, U.S. ending stocks reduced by 20 million bushels with world ending stocks also reduced slightly, and feed usage raised 250 million bushels,” Roose says.
Roose added, “With very little risk premium in the grain market, the trade may add premium with uncertainties in South America weather. The key to this report was how much of the negative news was dialed in.”
