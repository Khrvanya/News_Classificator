AHDB analyst Duncan Wyatt discusses the impact on beef carcase values of closing the eating out market in response to COVID-19.
Given the recent developments in relation to coronavirus, the Market Development team have been working to review their activity and ensure it delivers solutions in line with the rapidly changing demands of the UK consumer.
We have amended our current social media strategy in the short term to address the changing situation for consumers, with content being posted on social media focusing on store cupboard ingredients, basic recipes and batch cooking. Blogs are also being created to ensure that consumers can get the best out of larger joints of meat, as well as how to store potatoes and vegetables to ensure the longest possible shelf life, ensuring that all sectors are coming together to maximise content and information.
We are also working with the Consumer Insight team to monitor the situation in retail, and ensure our promotional activity reflects the changing situation. Our ongoing work with international partners ensures we are sharing best practice and learnings across a number of industry sectors.
