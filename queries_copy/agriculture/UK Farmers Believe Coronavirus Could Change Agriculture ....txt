Most U.K. farmers believe the coronavirus crisis could ultimately “change agriculture for the better” after the current disruption and uncertainty subsides, reports the Eastern Daily Press .
An online “snapshot” survey carried out by Savills Rural Research on April 6-7 aimed to understand how the pandemic has affected practices and sentiments within the farming industry.
Key findings include that 29% of farms have seen disruption to staffing and 43% have experienced disruption in their routes to market as a result of coronavirus. But although “positive sentiment” has fallen since the start of the year, a majority of respondents (59%) said they consider that coronavirus will change U.K. agriculture for the better. Only 5% thought it would change it for the worse.
