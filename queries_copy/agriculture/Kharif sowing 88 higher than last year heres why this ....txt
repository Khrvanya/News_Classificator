While a majority of India’s population depends on agriculture, the sector is still dependent on monsoon rains which determine the success and failure of crop sowing season every year. Last year’s underwhelming monsoon was a major sore point for not just rural India but also other sectors such as automobile and FMCG which rely on rural income.
However, this year has fared well on the monsoon front. Cumulative rainfall as of 1st July 2020 was 15.8% above long-term average. Spatial distribution of monsoon was also excess on a cumulative basis. However, over the last couple of weeks, rainfall has been weakening in southern India and parts of north and north-west India. Four out of the 36 sub-divisions across India have received deficient rainfall so far, 18 have received normal rainfall, and 14 have received excess rainfall.
