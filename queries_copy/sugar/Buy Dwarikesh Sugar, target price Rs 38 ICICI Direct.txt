ICICI Direct has given a buy rating to Dwarikesh Sugar Industries with a 12-month target price of Rs 38. The share price moved up by 1.17 per cent from its previous close of Rs 25.75. The last traded stock price is Rs 26.05.
The industry has seen some impact of lockdown in terms of 1-1.5 million tonnes (million tonnes) sugar demand destruction due to adverse impact on carbonated drinks & ice-creams. Moreover, Dwarikesh has produced 22 per cent higher sugar in the 2019-20 crushing season (some impacted by closing down of jaggery, khandsari units in March due to lockdown). Given lower demand during lockdown, the company received a reduced quota of 55,000 tonnes in the June quarter. However, the brokerage believes sugar demand is back on track in June 2020 and for the rest of the year, the company is expected to receive an average 30,000 tonnes/month domestic sale quota.
The company is foraying into the sanitisers segment with 12,000 litre/day capacity, which is likely to increase to 24,000 litre/day in future. The opportunity in the sanitisers segment can be large given companies are allowed to export in bulk quantities. Considering higher realisation in sanitisers (Rs 100/litre vis-à-vis Rs 54/litre in ethanol), the category is likely to be earnings accretive. The brokerage has not considered it in its expectations.
The company’s debt levels are comfortable given a large part of the Rs 650-crore debt is at the concessional interest rate. The brokerage expects Dwarikesh to generate Rs 300 crore of operating cash flows in the next two years, which would result in a significant reduction in high cost working capital debt. It expects strong 16.8 per cent, 34.4 per cent growth in revenue, earnings, respectively, during FY20-22. The brokerage values the stock at 1.2 times FY21 book value with a target price of Rs 38/share and have a buy recommendation.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company reported standalone sales of Rs 461.75 crore, up 44.52 per cent from last quarter sales of Rs 319.52 crore and up 118.60 per cent from last year's same quarter sales of Rs 211.23 crore. The company reported net profit after tax of Rs 44.27 crore in the latest quarter.
