Directed by Kevin Abstract , the visual opens with an NSFW scene of a couple in bed. An alien disturbs their private time and shoots the man dead, continuing to sing the intro of the love song. The rest of the music video sees the group in strange predicaments, with Merlyn and Dom McLennon entering the scene of the crime, Matt Champion rapping in a fiery hell setting with Satan and Bearface lying on the floor across Abstract who’s stuck on the ceiling with green slime.
According to Abstract, he got the inspiration for the video from a dream. “i was having a really hard time coming up with the concept for the video for sugar and then one day I woke up from an insane nightmare and was like holy f*ck that’s the video,” he wrote in a tweet. He added, “that was my first time doing a big ass video like that bro im not gonna lie i was so nervous everyone on set was so helpful though can’t wait to do the next one.”
