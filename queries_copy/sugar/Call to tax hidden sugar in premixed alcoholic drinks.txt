Chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: "It is a national scandal that because these drinks contain alcohol, they are not subject to the sugar tax or any form of coherent nutrition labelling.
Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, who chairs the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: "Consumers have the right to know exactly what they are drinking.
"This latest research demonstrates - once again - that the current system of the self-regulation of alcohol labelling isn't working and the industry is not taking its responsibilities seriously.
"Shoppers who buy alcohol get less information about what's in their drink than those who buy milk or orange juice. This is simply outrageous."
John Timothy, of the Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers and brewers in the UK, said: "The industry has signed up to a number of Europe-wide voluntary commitments on nutrition which will give consumers access to information both on labels and through websites within the next two years.
A Treasury spokesperson said: "Pre-mixed spirit drinks are taxed through alcohol duties, which are at a significantly higher rate than the childhood obesity focussed soft drinks industry levy. These raise over Â£12bn a year which helps pay for vital public services such as the NHS."
