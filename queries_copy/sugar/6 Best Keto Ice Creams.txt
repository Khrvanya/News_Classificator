The keto diet involves drastically reducing your carb intake and replacing it with fat.
Since ice cream is generally high in carbs, most of which come from sugar, it typically doesn’t fit into a keto diet.
However, several brands of low carb ice cream are made with plant fibers and sugar alcohols that don’t get digested. As such, they don’t contribute carbs to your diet. You can also make keto ice cream at home.
Here are the top 6 store-bought and homemade keto ice creams.
Some vendors offer ice cream for purchase online. This can be a convenient option as long as safe and timely delivery is guaranteed. Online ordering may not be available in all areas, so you may have to look for products locally.
Rebel Creamery makes keto-friendly ice creams that are low in carbs but still taste creamy and delicious.
In particular, their varieties are low in net carbs, which are calculated by subtracting the total grams of fiber and sugar alcohols in a serving from the total grams of carbs.
Most people on a keto diet need to eat fewer than 50 grams of net carbs per day to achieve ketosis, but some individuals need to reduce carbs even more (
With only 5 grams of net carbs in an entire pint, Rebel’s Butter Pecan is a tasty treat that can be enjoyed on a keto diet.
Pints are available for purchase online and at several major grocery stores.
