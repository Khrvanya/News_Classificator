Being able to monitor your blood sugar levels with a good glucose meter, even if you're not diabetic , is one of many different metrics that can be useful for keeping tabs on your health.
There are tons of options on the market when it comes to glucose meters -- some are very simple and only tell you how high your sugar is, but some offer extra features, like Bluetooth capability to connect to your phone. No matter what features you want, it's important to find a monitor that works for you so that you actually use it.

Below, I interviewed two doctors to get their insights on what to look for when you shop for a glucose meter. The five blood sugar meters below are curated based on the doctors' picks, and are pulled from best-seller lists and top reviews online.
If you don't love the idea of sticking your finger to draw blood multiple times a day, a continuous blood glucose monitoring system may be right for you. The Freestyle Libre monitors your blood sugar with a thin sensor that you insert under the skin (it's not painful) and you wear the sensor all day. You then scan the sensor with the device to get a blood sugar reading. It's also good for getting a consistent and deeper understanding of your blood sugar levels.
"For people who are interested in deeper insights into their glucose levels, I'll often recommend the Freestyle Libre for continuous glucose monitoring," says Dr. Nate Favini, medical lead of Forward . "By placing a sensor on your arm, you can track your glucose constantly through the day and develop your understanding of what makes your sugar levels go up and down. People will often be surprised that foods that they assumed were good for their glucose levels may be causing spikes in their sugar. Though continuous glucose monitors are more expensive, they can help you understand what types of food and exercise are best for you."
