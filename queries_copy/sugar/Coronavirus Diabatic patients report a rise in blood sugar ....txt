The lockdown has changed all of our lives in so many ways. While many of us have adopted healthier eating habits (to an extent), it has also curbed our physical activity and is leading to a rise in a sedentary lifestyle. A lot of us are also working from home and have an erratic schedule which is messing up with our metabolic system. People suffering from medical conditions, such as diabetes and other chronic health conditions are at a higher risk. In fact, a new report found out that during the lockdown, diabetic patients reported a rise in their blood sugar levels by upto 20%.
An analysis was done by a private healthcare company, Beato, wherein 8,200 diabetic patients across the country were surveyed. According to the findings, while average fasting readings remained around 135 mg/dL till March, the readings took a sharp spike upto 165 mg/dL by mid-April.
03/8Change in lifestyle to be blamed?
Some of the reasons for this spike were stress, anxiety, lifestyle changes, sedentary habits and limited or confined physical activity.
In India, rising blood sugar levels were particularly recorded in regions like the North, West and North-East, which are also major carb consuming regions in the country.
04/8Why is it on the rise?
While the report blamed rising blood sugar levels on an unhealthy and disrupted lifestyle, we do know that stress is one of the prevalent factors contributing to diabetes. Stress, anxiety has been on the rise during these uncertain times and they have taken a toll on our health, leading to chronic problems.
Considering diabetes levels are especially high in a country like India, it's important to manage, prevent or delay the onset of the chronic health problem. If not managed well, it could lead to other problems like obesity, increased inflammation as well.
The lockdown has also turned many into home bakers and we have seen a rise in the consumption of sweet goods. While sweets aren't the only contributing factor to rising diabates rates, following unhealthy eating habits, coupled with an inactive lifestyle can have lasting consequences in the long run.
Rising blood sugar levels should never be taken lightly, more so, at a time when the pandemic is spreading at such a vast rate. People with high or unmanaged blood sugar levels have less than normal blood flow, which makes it difficult for the body to harness nutrients, natural defences meant to protect the body against several infections and promote healing. Because of their weakened immune system, people with diabetes are more likely to develop infections and chronic risks than those without diabetes. Studies have now also shown that even elevated blood levels can make people prone to experience risky outcomes, infections, longer hospitalization and prolonged recovery time. Here are some other key factors diabetic patients should keep in mind during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Lockdown or not, it's vital to follow a healthy lifestyle to stay fit as well as fight off health issues pertaining to stress, blood sugar flare-up or obesity. Here are a few tips which can help prevent diabates from flaring up and lead a healthy lifestyle.
-Watch your diet. Ensure you have plenty of veggies, fruits, grains, pulses, antioxidant and inflammation-fighting foods on a regular basis. Unrefined, low-carb, moderated portion sizes are preferred.
-Maintain a proper eating schedule as well.
-Include some form of physical activity in your daily plan. Do not sit all day long. Regular exercise can be one of the ways to fight off a sudden spike in sugar levels.
-Have more fruits and sources which have natural sugar in them. Try to switch to healthier alternatives like honey or jaggery.
-Sleep is just as important as diet and exercise. Ensure you get 7-8 hours of good quality sleep without fail.
-Drink water and stay hydrated through the day.
-If you have diabetes, monitor your levels and do not forget to take your medications.
