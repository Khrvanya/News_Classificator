Afternoon Market Recap for July 2, 2020
Ben Potter | Jul 02, 2020
After two sessions of big gains in the grain markets, a round of profit-taking pushed corn priced more than 1.5% lower, with some wheat contracts down as much as 3% today. Soybean losses were tempered by another large sale of new crop beans headed to China, announced this morning. More hot, dry weather expected later in July could create some additional chances for upward mobility next week, depending on where rains hit – and miss.
A mostly dry weekend may lie ahead, unless you live in the Plains. NOAA’s latest 72-hour cumulative precipitation map predicts little to no additional rainfall through Sunday for large portions of Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. The agency’s latest 8-to-14-day outlook shows seasonally warm weather probable for all of the central U.S. between July 9 and July 15, with drier-than-normal conditions emerging during this time for most areas south of I-90.
On Wall St., stocks moved higher after the U.S. government reported 4.8 million jobs were added last month, versus analyst expectations of less than 3 million. That helped the Dow jump 258 points higher in afternoon trading to 25,993. Energy futures also moved higher, with crude oil up nearly 1.5% to move back above $40 per barrel. Diesel was up more than 2% this afternoon, with gasoline up nearly 3%. The U.S. Dollar firmed slightly.
For a second straight session, commodity funds were net buyers of all major grain contracts on Thursday, including corn (+35,000), soybeans (+11,000), soymeal (+7,000), soyoil (+2,000) and CBOT wheat (+6,500).
Note: Grain markets will be closed Friday, July 3, in observation of the Independence Day holiday. Markets will resume on Monday, as will our daily morning and afternoon newsletters. See you then, and have a safe, happy holiday this weekend.
Corn prices tilted more than 1.5% lower on a round of profit-taking and technical selling after drumming up substantial gains Tuesday and Wednesday.
