General Comments Cotton closed a little lower on demand worries and in spite of deteriorating crop conditions in the Cotton Belt. Export sales were negative last week for old crop and were only slightly positive for new crop and ideas are that the USDA export sales report released this morning will show similar results.

Demand will slowly improve but the industry should have plenty of supplies to work with in the short term.

The Brazil mills are producing Sugar but might switch back to producing ethanol soon if prices continue to improve for the ethanol.
