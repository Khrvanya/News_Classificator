Stodden, 25, shared a video with the Beverly Hills, 90210 star on Tuesday, showing the pair enjoying some time in what appears to be a hot tub.
"9021 now I kn0w..." Stodden wrote in the caption accompanying the video, in which the duo gave a shoutout to a woman named Ashley.
Reps for Green, 46, and Stodden did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
While it's unclear when the video was taken, Green and Stodden were spotted picking up food together at a Mexican restaurant in Agoura Hills, California, in June.
An eyewitness told PEOPLE at the time that "they were not acting at all like they are together" romantically.
On Tuesday, Green enjoyed a lunch outing with model Tina Louise at Sugar Taco in Los Angeles, a vegan restaurant that she co-owns.

Green opened up about the split on his …With Brian Austin Green podcast, telling listeners that he and Fox, 34, "had an amazing relationship" and that they will always love each other.

"I was shocked and I was upset about it," he said, "but I can’t be upset at her because she didn’t ask to feel that way. It wasn’t a choice she made; that’s the way she honestly felt. We talked about it a little more and said let’s separate for a bit … and so we did."
Fox, meanwhile, has been spending time with rapper Machine Gun Kelly . The new couple showed some PDA at the LAX airport in Los Angeles over the weekend, and the Jennifer's Body actress even appeared in one of the artist's latest music videos .
