Goel’s equity portfolio’s worth fell to multi-year low in the March quarter.
Goel owns more than 1 per cent stake in nearly three dozen stocks, many of which doubled prices in the last three months.
NEW DELHI: A majority of this ace investor’s portfolio stocks were down in the dumps last one year. But the recent rally has helped at least 24 of them surge anywhere between 50 per cent and 165 per cent from their 52-week lows.
These stocks are largely from sugar, auto and paper and packaging sectors. We are talking about the portfolio of smallcap investor Anil Kumar Goel.
Goel’s equity portfolio’s worth fell to multi-year low in the March quarter, as per publicly available data with Trendlyne, only to rise 19 per cent to Rs 453 crore from there.
BSE data showed Goel’s portfolio holding KRBL hit a 52-week low of Rs 91.25 on March 26. On Tuesday, shares of the packaged foods company traded at Rs 246-odd level, up 165 per cent from its March lows.
Dalmia Bharat Sugars, another portfolio stock, has jumped 155 per cent to Rs 112 from its March 25 low of Rs 40.30. Among other sugar stocks in his portfolio, Magadh Sugar is up 108 per cent from its March low, and Avadh Sugar 113 per cent.
After the government announced an MSP hike for kharif crops last month, there are hopes that the support price for sugar will also be increased. Investors are also expecting the government to announce a new export policy for sugar for 2020-21 (October-September season) as a drop in domestic consumption along with excess production may require the country to export more to clear the stock.
Among others, Srikalahasthi Pipes has offered Goel 107 per cent return since March lows. “With a comfortable order book in hand for supply of DI (ductile iron) pipes, the company’s strategy is to increase DI capacity, thereby giving DI pipes the priority as the safest mode for transporting water,” Progressive Share Brokers said in a report.
Publicly available data on Trendlyne showed Goel’s net worth hit a peak of Rs 1,300 crore at the end of December, 2017, before he hit a long dry patch. But that seems to be over now.
The BSE Smallcap Index hit its record high of 20,183 on January 15, 2018, and is now down 40 per cent from that level.
Goel owns more than 1 per cent stake in nearly three dozen stocks, many of which doubled prices in the last three months.
His portfolio stock Shivam Autotech recovered 90 per cent to Rs 15.7 from last week of March low. Among others, Dhampur Sugar Mills is up 91 per cent , JBM Auto 92 per cent, Uttam Sugars 91 per cent, Dwarikesh Sugar 89 per cent, Triveni Engineering 86 per cent and South India Paper Mills 82 per cent.
