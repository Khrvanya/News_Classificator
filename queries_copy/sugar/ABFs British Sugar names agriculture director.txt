Associated British Foods’ (ABF) British Sugar has announced the appointment of Peter Watson as its new agriculture director.
The appointment follows the news that, after more than 35 years at British Sugar, Colm McKay will retire from the role at the end of 2019.
Watson has a wide range of experience, drawn from roles across British Sugar and its sister companies, and will commence work in the new job from 1 January 2020.
“I’m looking forward to getting started in my new role, working with our 3,000 growers, hauliers and industry partners to continue to drive innovation and progression in our homegrown sugar industry​,” he said.
As part of ABF, the company’s output is sold to consumers in the UK under the Silver Spoon brand and under many supermarket own-label brands.
Last month, Food Manufacture​ reported that ABF continued to be a safe bet​ ​ within the food and drink manufacturing industry, despite taking a hit from dwindling sugar profits, according to industry experts.
A continued strong performance from the firm’s grocery division was boosted by manufacturing capacity at Jordan’s Dorset Cereals and Ryvita, and strong revenue growth from Twinings Ovaltine, but it was anticipated that the decline of AB Sugar would put a dent in this year’s profits.
