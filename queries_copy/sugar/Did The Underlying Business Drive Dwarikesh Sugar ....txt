Did The Underlying Business Drive Dwarikesh Sugar Industries’s (NSE:DWARKESH) Lovely 714% Share Price Gain?
Simply Wall St November 7, 2019
For many, the main point of investing in the stock market is to achieve spectacular returns. And highest quality companies can see their share prices grow by huge amounts. To wit, the Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Limited ( NSE:DWARKESH ) share price has soared 714% over five years. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. On top of that, the share price is up 35% in about a quarter.
It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During the last half decade, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries became profitable. Sometimes, the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come, which in turn justifies very strong share price gains.

We know that Dwarikesh Sugar Industries has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, it has a TSR of 751% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Dwarikesh Sugar Industries provided a TSR of 5.5% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 53% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy.
