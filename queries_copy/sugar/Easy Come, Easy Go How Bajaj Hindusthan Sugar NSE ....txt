Long term investing works well, but it doesn’t always work for each individual stock. It hits us in the gut when we see fellow investors suffer a loss. Anyone who held Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar Limited ( NSE:BAJAJHIND ) for five years would be nursing their metaphorical wounds since the share price dropped 76% in that time. And it’s not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 56% in the last year. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 39% in the last three months.
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
During five years of share price growth, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.
In contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 11% a year in the five year period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.
Balance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time .
We regret to report that Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar shareholders are down 56% for the year. Unfortunately, that’s worse than the broader market decline of 2.0%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there’s a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year’s performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 25% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.
