After being quarantined with their families for a few weeks, business travelers may actually miss staying in hotels alone. And if you ask road warriors if they miss any hotels in particular, they might answer DoubleTree — for the signature chocolate chip cookies alone.
The hotel chain, known for serving its guests warm cookies at check-in, understands customers might be craving them by this point. That's why DoubleTree has published its recipe for the first time .
"I know this is an anxious time for everyone,” said Shawn McAteer, senior vice president and global head, DoubleTree by Hilton. “A warm chocolate chip cookie can’t solve everything, but it can bring a moment of comfort and happiness."
“We hope families enjoy the fun of baking together during their time at home, and we look forward to welcoming all our guests with a warm DoubleTree cookie when travel resumes.”
Based on social media reaction, customers were delighted.
"THIS is how you treat your loyal customers... Christmas in April... Thanks," wrote @BlackWomen_ .
@harryagapidis was grateful for the cookie fix but shared a warning: "Great job but also do warn everybody that it's 300 calories per cookie because otherwise we won't be able to fit through the door when we come out of lockdown."
If you're willing to risk it, designate a family member to head to the grocery store and buy these ingredients and a gallon of milk to wash them down.
