Lafarge Africa Q1 2020 revenue was up 9.8% y/y to N63.7bn, driven by higher Cement Sales (up 11% y/y to N62.3bn) which offset the weakness in Aggregate and Concrete (down 21% y/y to N1.4bn). The growth in Cement sales was driven by increased volumes (up 8% y/y to 1.4MT) and price increment (c.2%) implemented by management at the start of the year.
Buoyed by a steep decline in Finance Cost (down 69% y/y), PBT rose significantly, up 104% y/y to N9.4bn in Q1 2020 compared with N4.6bn in Q1 2019. EPS rose by 1.56x to N0.50 in Q1 2020 (Q1 2019; N0.20).
Management noted that the sale of cement weakened significantly in the month of April due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Consequently, we expect Revenue in Q2 to be affected by slowdown in cement volumes, owing to subdued activities in the construction sector caused by the social distancing measures.
Despite our expectation of weaker Q2 Revenue, we expect earnings to receive a boost from significantly lower finance cost due to the improved leverage position of the company (Debt/equity ratio moderated to 0.19x in FY 2019 compared with 2.25x in FY 2018 and 1.83x in FY 2017). The key risk to our outlook is the possibility of a second wave of lockdown due to growing numbers of new cases of COVID 19.
We have updated our model and the overall impact is a marginal downward adjustment of our price target to N23.9/s from N24.4/s previously. However, we maintain a Buy rating given the 117% upside potential implied by our target price from the latest closing price of N11.0/s.
We believe the steep decline in the stock price (down c.28% since the start of the year) presents an attractive entry point for investors. Lafarge is currently trading at a FY2020e P/E and EV/EBITDA of 4.7x and 2.9x respectively, a discount to EM peers average of 11.5x and 6.5x respectively.
Bond market to maintain a similar trend on Tuesday as the bulk of the attention will be skewed towards the outcome of the Sukuk auction.
