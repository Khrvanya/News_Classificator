A highly acclaimed plant-based doctor says 'a little sugar or salt' doesn't hurt when it comes to a whole-food, plant-based diet.
Dr. T. Colin Campbell , one of the most foremost doctor in the plant-based movement and author of The China Study, made the comments during an interview for PlantPure TV.
Answering questions posed by his son Nelson Campbell, Dr. Campbell discussed a range of topics, including the technological and commercially-driven history of nutritional and medical science, and why specific health recommendations are sometimes made that are not well-founded on science among others.
Speaking about how the massive amounts of information available can be overwhelming, and about how the sources of that information can present  it in a way that suits their agenda, Dr. Campbell said eating a healthy diet is 'really very simple'.
"Eat a whole-food, plant-based diet," he said. "Flavor it up a bit with herbs, spices. A little sugar or salt doesn't hurt. Make your food tasty, just do that, and people will get that simple notion. Try to avoid the animal protein-based foods, and that's going to turn the world around."
