Former Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar has blasted the team for their poor defensive display in the 3-2 defeat to Wolves on Sunday.
Spurs have had experienced major defensive problems that go back to the start of the campaign and those issues have persisted under Jose Mourinho.
Neither Jan Vertonghen nor Toby Alderweireld look anywhere close to the players they once were and Mourinho chose to leave both players on the bench against Wolves.
He opted to start with a back three of Davinson Sanchez, Eric Dier and Japhet Tanganga yesterday and the trio certainly didn’t cover themselves in glory with their performances.
Dier failed to clear Ruben Vinagre’s cross for the first goal and Tanganga was at fault for the second and third goals.  He failed to clear the ball for Wolves’ equaliser and got sat down by Raul Jimenez for what proved to be the winner.
There have been reports suggesting that the Spurs head coach has prioritised a defensive rebuild in the summer ( The Express ) but he has to make do with what he has got until the end of the campaign.
Sugar took to social media after the defeat against Nuno Espirito Santo’s side to voice his frustration at the defensive performance:
Never mind Kane out and Son out. The problem is we can't defend @SpursOfficial

Our defending for Wolves’ first goal, in particular, was extremely poor as one of Sanchez or Dier should have easily cut out that cross. Tanganga should have done much better than just hacking at it and putting it on a plate for Matt Doherty. The youngster’s inexperience showed on Sunday.
