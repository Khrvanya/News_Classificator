A key part of following a ketogenic, or keto, diet is reducing your sugar intake.
This is necessary for your body to enter ketosis, a state in which your body burns fat rather than sugar for energy (
However, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy sweet-tasting foods.
Sugar alcohols are sweeteners that have tastes and textures similar to those of sugar, but fewer calories and a less significant effect on blood sugar levels (
As a result, they can be a satisfying option for individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake, such as those following a keto diet.
This article explains whether sugar alcohols are keto-friendly, as well as which ones may be better options for you.
While there are many types of sugar alcohols, common ones you may see on food labels include (
Erythritol. Often made by fermenting the glucose found in cornstarch, erythritol has 70% of the sweetness of sugar but 5% of the calories.
Isomalt. Isomalt is a mixture of two sugar alcohols — mannitol and sorbitol. Providing 50% fewer calories than sugar, it’s most commonly used to make sugar-free hard candies and 50% as sweet.
Maltitol. Maltitol is processed from the sugar maltose. It’s 90% as sweet as sugar with almost half the calories.
Sorbitol. Commercially produced from glucose, sorbitol is 60% as sweet as sugar with about 60% of the calories.
Xylitol. One of the most common sugar alcohols, xylitol is as sweet as regular sugar but has 40% fewer calories.
Due to their low calorie contents, sugar alcohols are frequently used to sweeten sugar-free or diet products like gum, yogurts, ice cream, coffee creamers, salad dressings, and protein bars and shakes (
Sugar alcohols are often commercially manufactured as a low calorie way to sweeten food products. Common ones you may see on ingredient lists include erythritol, isomalt, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol.
