Pastry chef, businesswoman and everyone’s favourite dessert queen Pooja Dhingra nursed her baking dreams since childhood. But it took wings when she enrolled at Cesar-Ritz, Switzerland’s hospitality management school and later interned under the famous French chocolatier, Jean Charles Rochoux.
While her delectable desserts, especially macaroons leave everyone craving for more, it’s a simple molten chocolate cake that this owner of the most sought after baking studio turns to. “There is something magical and soothing about using basic ingredients and watching them transform into a beautiful dessert. This quick and easy cake with just five ingredients is my ‘go to dessert’ when I’m having difficult days. A spoon of the cakey crumb and molten chocolate in the centre, is the perfect mood lifter,” explains Dhingra.
The cake is also special since it’s adapted from her friend Marie Kakouridis’ recipe. “Her grandmother used to make this cake for her when she was little and Marie often made it for me in Switzerland where we were together in school, when I was craving chocolate or feeling blue.”
