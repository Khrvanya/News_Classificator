Alan Sugar has shared the view from his Florida holiday home in the pouring rain after Piers Morgan accused him of being holed up in a mansion in the sun during the coronavirus crisis.
Lord Sugar, 73, and his wife Ann are spending isolation at their home in the Sunshine State, but he's adamant it's not as luxurious as Piers made out.
He's tweeted a video from the tiny balcony of his Florida flat showing the complex being lashed by a massive rainstorm.
Lord Sugar wrote: "5 minutes ago the wife and I were going for a walk. Then the heavans [sic] opened. It is belting down."
Telly star Piers, 55, took issue with his frenemy over the weekend after Lord Sugar defended Brits who went to parks to sunbathe.

Lord Sugar hit back by explaining he's stuck in a small flat with a tiny balcony and no access to outdoor space at the complex.
He wrote: "Just so you know I don't have a house any more in Florida that's rubbish info @piersmorgan has spread to wind people up against me.
"I have a flat with a balcony.Pool area closed, no tennis,no golf, no boats all by law.1 hour exercise. All shops closed except food. i.e. same as UK."

Piers went on to insist he has given away two of his homes to loved ones who needed them more during the coronavirus crisis.
He revealed his parents are isolating at his country mansion and he has given his Beverly Hills pad to neighbours who needed more space.
He went on to insist his own London pad is not spacious and only has a tiny garden for him to share with his wife Celia and their young daughter Elise.
