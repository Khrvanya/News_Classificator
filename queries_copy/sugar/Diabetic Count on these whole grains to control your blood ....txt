Here are some important factors to consider for diabetics and people with blood sugar issues:
When you are trying out new foods, it is easy to go overboard. But, if you are a diabetic, over-consumption could cause your blood sugar to shoot. This is something you do not want to happen. So start with two-thirds of cooked whole grains or two slices of whole-grain bread and see how your sugar reacts to it.
To help your body deal with sugar, pair the grains with unsaturated fat and protein. Some good sources of protein that you could start with are nuts, seeds, beans, etc. If you want to eat whole grain bread, pair it with vegan cheese or nut butter.
Brown rice, whole barley, kernel bread, wheat berries, and millet are a great choice. These are much better than processed ones. Least-processed grains have all the nutritional values intact.
You will come across many products while shopping that will appear as if they are wholegrain, but are not. To avoid getting tricked, you have to read the labels carefully. Terms like ‚Äòenriched‚Äô can easily throw you off track. That is simply a term used when only parts of the grain are used and not the whole product.
When you come across labels that read ‚Äòmade from whole grain‚Äô or ‚Äòcontains whole grain,‚Äô they may still not be 100 per cent. Look at the ingredients listed, if whole grain is the first ingredient that is listed then you are good to go.
There are other factors that you should keep in mind as well. For example, did you know that brown bread is brown in colour due to added colors? You just have to be smart about the things you eat and include physical activity to control your blood sugar and to improve your overall health.
There are over 72 million adult diabetic patients in India alone. It is quite easy to manage your blood sugar once you know how to. Managing diabetes does take a little learning and getting used to but, the knowledge will help you lead a healthy and happy life.
