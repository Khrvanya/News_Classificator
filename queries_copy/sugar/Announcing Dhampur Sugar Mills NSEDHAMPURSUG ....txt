Dhampur Sugar Mills Limited ( NSE:DHAMPURSUG ) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 29% in the last month. But that doesn’t change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. In fact, the share price is 271% higher today. We think it’s more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 38% drop, in the last year.
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the last half decade, Dhampur Sugar Mills became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.
NSEI:DHAMPURSUG Past and Future Earnings, March 9th 2020
We know that Dhampur Sugar Mills has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts .
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Dhampur Sugar Mills’s TSR for the last 5 years was 316%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
We regret to report that Dhampur Sugar Mills shareholders are down 35% for the year (even including dividends) . Unfortunately, that’s worse than the broader market decline of 2.0%. Having said that, it’s inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 33% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.
