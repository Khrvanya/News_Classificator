On Sugar Island, Chippewa County first responders did some emergency training.
The sheriff’s office says it was preparing for the event the ferry is not able to run.
Deputies and members of the U.S. Coast Guard used a hovercraft and an emergency rescue airboat to practice shuttling people off the island on Saturday.
The island’s fire and EMS participated in the training as well.
The sheriff’s office says everything was going well until the airboat was parked near the shore and froze to the slush.
Emergency crews say this kind of training helps keeps everyone on the island safe.
