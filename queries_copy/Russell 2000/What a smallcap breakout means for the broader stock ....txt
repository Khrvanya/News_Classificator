While the Russell 2000 is up more than 20% in the year to date, it’s still shy of returning to record territory. Over the last 12 months, the index is up 9.2%, far behind the 17.3% rise by the S&P 500 over the same stretch, as well as the 13.7% gain for the Dow and a nearly 23% rise for the Nasdaq. The Russell through Tuesday remained 6.7% below its record close of 1,740.75 hit on Aug. 31, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
The Russell 2000 is up around 2.5% this week and 4.3% in November, versus a week-to-date gain of 1.2% and a 3.6% monthly rise so far by the S&P 500.
“Seeing small-caps at 52-week highs is further confirmation to the overall health of this bull market,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, in a blog post . “We’ve already seen large-caps and various countries around the world break out, and now we have participation from a once-lagging group. Participation is the key to any lasting bull market, and this is another great sign as we head into 2020.”
Historically, a return to a 52-week high by the Russell 2000 after more than a year has been a positive sign for forward returns, Detrick said, noting that in the past instances dating back to October 1982 the index has risen 10 out of 11 times over the next 12 months with an average rise of 17% and a median gain of 16.4%.

The stock market, particularly in its current state, is no place for amateurs. Sullimar Capital analyst Bill Brewster delivered that message to followers in a Twitter thread about how he lost a family member.
