These conditions, among others, create what we call “orphaned” stocks: stocks that analysts and investors have mostly disregarded. We aren’t the only ones who have noticed, either. Hedge funds have already been taking advantage of the opportunities created by limited analyst coverage in the small- and mid-cap markets. Even without the research capabilities available to hedge funds, however, it’s still possible to sniff out potential values—if you know where to look.
Here are a few areas we’ve discovered to be fertile ground for orphaned stocks:
Stocks that aren’t in a major index. Index funds don’t base investment decisions on the investment fundamentals of any particular stock. That not only means an index can easily include overvalued stocks, but that the flow of money into index funds can make those same companies even more overvalued. After all, index funds buy stocks indiscriminately by design—if a company is in the index, they buy it.
· Micro and small-cap stocks. Investors understandably like to know what they’re buying. Smaller companies with solid business models and large insider ownership can slide under the radar because not only do Wall Street research houses tend not to cover them (see above), but big investment companies tend to ignore them. For large money managers with hundreds of billions of dollars to invest, it is not worth the time and effort required to analyze a small capitalization company. Smaller firms and individual investors don’t have that issue, however, and can wind up finding value hiding in plain sight if they’re willing to do the legwork. At the same time, however, investors need to be wary of micro and small capitalization companies as the incidence of fraud in these companies is higher. That is why we like to look for small/micro-cap companies with a CEO with a large ownership as their interests are better aligned with shareholders.
· Complex ownership structures. Securities which do not follow the same ownership structures as most mainstream companies can offer opportunities for investors willing to understand them. Tracking stocks or companies with a maze of parents and subsidiaries frequently get ignored by investors unwilling to spend the time necessary to understand the business. This creates opportunities for those willing to roll up their sleeves and do the necessary homework.
· Spinoffs. It can be hard to recognize the value of a division buried within the complex finances of an unwieldy conglomerate. That creates opportunities when large conglomerates hold assets that Wall Street analysts do not give them “credit” for. In some cases, spinning off a valuable division may unlock more value for shareholders than is reflected in the parent company’s share price. However as we pointed out in our January 20 piece, spinoffs have dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade. However, as the article discusses, there are characteristics to look for that dramatically put the odds of success in your favor.
· Out-of-favor industries. In a recent column, we discussed that low volatility and rising flows into passive investments had pushed publicly traded money managers out of favor among major investors. The recent announcement that Franklin Resources
BEN will acquire Legg Mason demonstrates the potential value to be found via a close examination of an industry major investors have left for dead.
· Stocks labeled as “sells” or “holds” on Wall Street. As with out-of-favor industries, a ton of pessimism in a particular company can provide an opportunity . We like to say that sell-side analysts can tell you everything there is to know about a stock, except when to buy it. If a likely catalyst for an upside surprise exists, sells and holds can guide patient investors to potential value.
The Liberty Braves Group is a tracking stock that represents Liberty Media’s ownership of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball franchise and a related mixed-use real estate development project, the Battery Atlanta, located around SunTrust Park, the Braves’ home stadium. Rather than reflecting the actual economic performance of Liberty Media Corporation—which owns the Braves as well as ownership stakes in SiriusXM and the Formula 1 auto racing series—Liberty Braves Group tracks the economic performance of a portion of the parent company’s businesses, assets and liabilities.
With the 2020 Major League Baseball season in doubt and questions about whether games might need to take place in empty stadiums, the short-term outlook for sports-related securities may give potential investors pause. Taking a medium to long-term view, however, we think people will be anxious and excited to return to activities like baseball once the public health and general economic conditions begin to improve. That could bode well for investors in organizations like the Braves which are the epitome of a trophy asset. If Liberty ever decided to sell the team, the combination of a finite supply of teams and the growing ranks of U.S. billionaires willing to buy them bode well for investors. Media rights and the growing sports gambling arena suggest a strong future for team valuations, as well. Taking a conservative approach, assuming no premium to the current Forbes value for the Braves and assigning no value to the team’s real estate development initiatives (which could add an additional $3 to $6 per share of additional value), we see substantial upside at BATRK’s current share price. While the stock has risen off its recent low, it still is trading dramatically below where it was six months ago.

Orphaned companies that fly under Wall Street’s radar present opportunities for curious investors willing to dig into the details and locate potential value. Just remember that there’s no guarantee companies with these attributes are necessarily mispriced, or that a catalyst for realizing their potential value will actually appear. But for those willing to do the work, under-the-radar gems offer upside even as the big players on the major indices chase each other up—or down.
