Thanks to coronavirus-driven market volatility, exchange-traded funds tracking FTSE Russell’s U.S. indexes saw big shifts as the widely followed benchmarks executed their annual rebalancing on Friday.
The turnover at this year’s rebalancing was particularly high, says Jefferies strategist Steven DeSanctis. He estimates that the Russell U.S. indexes saw roughly 5% of their market value purchased or sold. That’s twice the 2.5% rate at last year’s reconstitution. A record 1.57 billion shares representing $56.7 billion were traded in the closing seconds across Nasdaq-listed stocks, a much higher volume compared to the 1.28 billion shares representing $42.59 billion during Russell’s 2019 reconstitution.
The rebalancing could have a big impact on investor portfolios, as some $240 billion in assets in more than 100 ETFs are tied to Russell’s U.S. indexes, including the $35.5 billion iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker: IWM) and the $21.5 billion iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB).
One likely factor behind the elevated turnover in Russell indexes: the equity market’s unusual volatility during the pandemic. After a yearlong rally in 2019, U.S. stocks saw a steep selloff in early 2020, followed by a rapid rebound beginning in late March. While the broader Russell 3000 is largely flat from last June, there was a notable divergence between different groups, says Catherine Yoshimoto, director of product management at FTSE Russell.
As of May 8, when FTSE Russell decided which stocks to move in and out of its various indexes, the weighted-average market capitalization of current Russell 1000 constituents had inflated 44% from the 2019 reconstitution, to $286 billion, marking the biggest yearly growth in at least a decade.
During the same period, the Russell 2000 has seen the weighted-average market cap of its members shrink by 10% to $1.9 billion, with its smallest stock tumbling nearly 38% to below $100 million, the first time under that threshold since the financial crisis.
As larger stocks get larger and smaller stocks get smaller, the breakpoint separating the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indexes—or the market cap of the 1001th largest stock—dropped by more than 16%, to just $3 billion from $3.6 billion last year. Jefferies’ DeSanctis estimates that the Russell 2000 will see its weighted-average market cap pulled down by about 16% after Friday’s rebalancing, as it loses the largest components to the large-cap benchmark.
The performance gap between growth and value stocks was even wider. From the 2019 rebalancing to the end of May, the weighted-average market cap of the Russell 1000 Growth index jumped by a whopping 83% to $486 billion. Peers in the Russell 1000 Value index, meanwhile, were largely stagnant during the same period.

Since the two indexes evenly split the Russell 1000’s total market cap at the reconstitution, it means that the expanding growth index will push many members to the value group and have a much greater concentration. The value benchmark will see a higher number of stocks joining its ranks.
The indexes are also seeing shifting sector exposure at Friday’s reconstitution. While the Russell 1000 remains largely unchanged, DeSanctis estimates that health-care stocks in the Russell 2000 will lose about two percentage points in weighting as some high-performing names grow and join the large-cap universe. Teladoc Health (TDOC) stock, for example, soared more than 230% over the past 12 months and is now part of the Russell 1000 with a $15 billion market cap. The Russell 2000 is also losing one percentage point in tech and gaining 1.5 percentage points in financials.
Again, that’s shadowed by the greater sector-weighting shift in the value and growth groups. Health-care exposure in the Russell Midcap Growth index, for example, will rise nearly six percentage points, while the Russell 2000 Value index will see its weighting in tech stocks drop almost five percentage points. Investors in ETFs that track these indexes should be aware of the large moves.
