According to the Foundation, the new deal will be multi-faceted and will lead to Litecoin being used ‚Äú‚Ä¶across gaming platforms within the Atari ecosystem, along with other potential ventures, such as joint merchandising.‚Äù
Originally founded in 1972, Atari was a pioneer in home computers as well as arcade and video games.
Most people of a certain age can recall their first interaction on an Atari machine with classic gaming titles such as Pong or Asteroids ‚Äì and that apparently includes the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee.
I became a software engineer b/c I loved video games and learned to program at a young age. I have fond memories of my first game console, the Atari 2600.
I‚Äôm excited about this partnership with @atari and soon the ability to preorder the Atari VCS with LTC! üïπÔ∏è #PayWithLitecoin https://t.co/iMjhpJcJsh

As Lee mentions, the partnership will see LTC being accepted as a means of payment for the new Atari VCS game console and will entitle the purchaser to a discount on the retail price. The PC/console hybrid is suitable for gaming and streaming but also allows users to develop and upload their own games and apps.
The Atari brand has already established payment channels with cryptocurrencies through the pre-launch sale of their own Atari token that is expected to go live in September 2020. Arranged through the company‚Äôs Gibraltar-based subsidiary Atari Chain , the token will be initially used in casino type games before being extended out to other use cases.
