Ethereum is changing hands at $233.00, mostly unchanged both since the start of Thursday and on a day-to-day basis. ETH/USD touched the low of $218.14 on May 15 and got back above $230.00. The sell-oof stopped on approach to daily SMA50, however, the further recovery is limited at this stage due to Ethereum's high correlation with Bitcoin.
There is a head and shoulders pattern that has emerged on the hourly chart which could send the price lower. But stopping this there is also a stubborn support level at 43.50 which the bears need to crack. To add it the bearish woes the price is also trading below the 55 and 200 moving averages.
