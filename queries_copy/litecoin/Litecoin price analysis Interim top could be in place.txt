For traders News and features Analysis Litecoin price analysis: Interim top could be in place
Litecoin has started to retreat lower in early week trading after testing major resistance, around the $78.50 level.
Litecoin price analysis shows that the cryptocurrency could fall back towards the $60.00 level, due to the presence of bearish MACD price divergence on the lower time frames.
Litecoin recently rallied to its highest trading level since mid-September, as the altcoin space continued its recent recovery.
The LTC/USD pair found strong technical resistance from the $78.00 level, before pulling back towards the $73.00 area.
In fact, the $78.00 to $80.00 area had been flagged as the likely near-term bullish target for the cryptocurrency for some time.

Litecoin technical analysis shows that the cryptocurrency is now overbought, with the RSI indicator at its highest level since April 2019.
Pullbacks towards the $60.00 to $55.00 support area will likely be seen as a major medium-term buying opportunity.
Litecoin technical analysis over the short term shows that the cryptocurrency remains bullish while trading above the $60.00 level.

Bearish MACD price divergence on the lower time frames is also warning that a stronger bearish correction may be about to take place.
Key short-term support for the LTC/USD pair is seen at the $71.00, and $67.00 levels.
