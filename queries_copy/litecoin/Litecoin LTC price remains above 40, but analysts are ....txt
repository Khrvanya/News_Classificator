Meanwhile, Alex Clay has presented an alternative theory . Clay’s analysis offers a more bullish scenario, explaining that the LTC price has completed two targets on its previous downward wave and is now climbing in an ascending channel. If there is a breakout of the middle line, the trader recommends taking a long position with price targets set at $47.10 and $47.52.
Popular crypto analyst Galaxy recently provided a bullish scenario for Bitcoin’s near-term. The analyst explained that Bitcoin is currently pushing against a key descending resistance level. If the Bitcoin price can break above that level, he predicts Bitcoin could rise all the way back to $9,000. The increase in bullish predictions could coincide with a decrease in panic selling caused by COVID-19 .
$6800 – $9000 is the dream trade I'm waiting for.
There is also a slight chance we can break the green line today/tomorrow and just go for it.
Either way, I'm patiently waiting to start riding the train to 9K. $BTC pic.twitter.com/kxJ8LyRacL
