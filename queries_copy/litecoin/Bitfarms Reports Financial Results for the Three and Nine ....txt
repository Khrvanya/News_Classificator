Bitfarms’ total revenue for Q3 2019 was US$9,739,000 compared to US$6,866,000 for the comparable three-month period in 2018 (“Q3 2018”). Revenue in Q3 2019 increased US$2,873,000 or 42% compared to the revenue in Q3 2018. The most significant factors influencing the net increase to Bitfarms’ revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2018 are the 40% higher average realized price per Bitcoin of US$10,281 in Q3 2019 compared to US$7,321 in Q3 2018, as well as 91 more Bitcoin mined resulting from Bitfarms’ average increased hashrate in excess of the average Network Difficulty during Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018.
Bitfarms’ cost of sales for Q3 2019 was US$5,276,000 compared to US$6,149,000 in Q3 2018. Costs of sales include energy and infrastructure expenses, rental expense, depreciation and amortization, electrician salaries, and, purchases and net change in inventory.
Energy and infrastructure expenses increased by US$753,000 or 34% in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018 as the Company added new Mining computers which had the effect of increasing electrical consumption from 22 MW at the end of Q3 2018 to 41 MW at the end of Q3 2019.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by US$1,864,000 in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018 due to the impairment loss of US$18,500,000 on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded by the Company in Q4 2018. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of US$215,000 in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018 resulting from the adoption of IFRS 16 by the Company in January 2019 as the Company amortizes right of use assets over the term of the relevant leases.

The increase in salaries expense in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018 was primarily offset by US$394,000 lower professional fees in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018 that primarily related to costs of preparation of the Company’s preliminary prospectus to list its common shares in Canada.

This press release makes reference to certain measures that are not recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. They are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company uses non-IFRS measures including “EBITDA,” “EBITDA margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA margin,” “Gross mining profit,” and “Gross mining margin” as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective.
EBITDA and EBITDA margin are common measures used to assess profitability before the impact of different financing methods, income taxes, depreciation of capital assets and amortization of intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are measures used to assess profitability before the impact of all of the items in calculating EBITDA in addition to certain other non-cash expenses. Gross mining profit and Gross mining margin are measures used to assess profitability after power costs in cryptocurrency production, the largest variable expense in mining. Management uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and to prepare annual operating budgets.
“EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before: (i) interest expense; (ii) income tax expense; and (iii) depreciation and amortization. “EBITDA margin” is defined as the percentage obtained when dividing EBITDA by Revenue. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) non-cash finance expenses; (iii) asset impairment charges; and (iv) other non-cash expenses. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as the percentage obtained when dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Revenue. “Gross mining profit” is defined as Revenue minus energy expenses for the Bitfarms segment of the Company. “Gross mining margin” is defined as the percentage obtained when dividing Gross mining margin by Revenue for the Bitfarms segment of the Company.
These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company’s results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial information reported under IFRS.
