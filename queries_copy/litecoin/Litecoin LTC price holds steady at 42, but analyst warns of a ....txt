In Grayscale’s most recent quarterly report , the cryptocurrency asset management firm reported that it holds almost 2% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin. This figure is up from 0.1% recorded at the end of 2019. The large uptick in ownership is attributed to increasing institutional interest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). As per the report, the firm’s ten crypto funds drew in over $500 million in investments, its best quarter on record.
