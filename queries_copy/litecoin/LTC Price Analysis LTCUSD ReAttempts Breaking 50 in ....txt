At $47.79, LTC/USD is increasing in value with modest gains both daily and from the days start. The seventh-largest cryptocurrency shifted in line with expectations and bounced from the $44.47 low of Wednesday. Furthermore, the resistance area may restrict the further upside at $50 and the next barrier established by the MA 50. From the last weekend, the MA 50 prevented the upside and established its position as a heavy resistance.
The bullish momentum is likely to persist, depending on the upside movement of the RSI from levels near to the mid-range. The ascending trendline reinforces the same bullish trend. Albeit the pattern is now in the ranging area, upward momentum had also ebbed and flowed toward $50 while the MA 50 and MA 200 may converge to drive up prices. In other terms, in upcoming sessions, Litecoin is positioned to test the resistance threshold at $50.
Short-term technical analysis already suggests that once the $50.00 level is violated, the LTC/USD pair may rebound against the $51.00 range. Towards the downward, a prolonged collapse of strength underneath the support level of $45.00 may cause LTC/USD investors to switch bearish and approach $37.17. Moreover, as the cryptocurrency market proceeds to trend higher along with Bitcoin, Litecoin may have a huge chance of making additional gains this week.
The LTC/USD pair will only be bullish whilst exchanging beyond the $45.00 mark , the main barrier is at the $50.00 mark. When the LTC/USD pair is exchanging under the $45.00, sellers may test the support levels of $41.43 and $37.17. Besides, the cryptocurrency registered increases of about 2.5 percent in the last 24 hours at $47.76 at the time of writing, while RSI’s signal line (14) renders a radical change into the positive side.
