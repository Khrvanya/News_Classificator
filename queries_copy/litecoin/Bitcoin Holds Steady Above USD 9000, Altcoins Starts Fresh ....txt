Bitcoin Holds Steady Above USD 9,000, Altcoins Starts Fresh Increase
Bitcoin price is still consolidating above a crucial support near USD 9,000.
Ethereum gained 3% to surpass USD 232, and XRP climbed above the USD 0.180 resistance.
BTM and NULS rallied close to 20% today.
In the past few days, bitcoin bears made more than two attempts to clear the USD 9,000 support. BTC spiked below USD 9,000, but it recovered quickly. The price is currently (08:30 UTC) up over 2% and it is approaching the USD 9,240 and USD 9,300 resistance levels.
Similarly, most major altcoins remained stable above important supports and recently started a fresh increase, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. ETH/USD is currently up more than 3% and it spiked above the USD 232 resistance. XRP/USD is showing positive signs and trading above the USD 0.180 resistance.
After retesting the USD 9,000 support, bitcoin price started a fresh increase. BTC surpassed the USD 9,150 level and it recently spiked above the USD 9,200 level. On the upside, the bulls are facing a crucial weekly resistance near USD 9,300. A successful close above the USD 9,300 level is needed for a sustained upward move in the coming days.
Conversely, the price could decline heavily below the USD 9,000 support. The next support is at USD 8,800, below which there are chances of more losses.
Ethereum price is surging and it recently broke the USD 230 and USD 232 resistance levels. ETH tested the USD 235 weekly resistance and it is consolidating gains. On the downside, the USD 230 and USD 228 levels are decent support, below which the price could revisit USD 220.
On the upside, a clear break above the USD 235 resistance may perhaps push the price towards the USD 242 level or even USD 250.
Bitcoin cash price is slowly rising above the USD 225 level. BCH is up over 2% and it is approaching the USD 230 resistance. A successful close above the USD 230 resistance could open the doors for a larger upward move towards the USD 245 and USD 250 levels. On the downside, the USD 220 level is a strong support.
Litecoin is gaining traction above the USD 42.00 and USD 42.20 resistance levels. LTC is likely to continue higher towards the USD 43.50 level. The main resistance is still near the USD 45.00 level. Conversely, the USD 40.00 support holds the key for a sharp decline in the near term.
XRP price is showing positive signs and it is now trading above the USD 0.180 resistance. The price is consolidating near USD 0.182 and it seems like the bulls are aiming a test of USD 0.185. The main resistance is near USD 0.190 and USD 00.192. A close above USD 0.192 might pump the price towards USD 0.200.
In the past three sessions, many small-capitalization altcoins gained over 5%, including BTM, NULS, ABBC, IOST, CHSB, ZRX, HEDG, ONT, ATOM, HOT, BNT, ALGO, LEND, TRX, and REP. Out of these, BTM rallied close to 20% above USD 0.085, and NULS surged above the USD 0.700 resistance.
To sum up, bitcoin price is showing positive signs above the USD 9,100 and USD 9,150 levels. If BTC continues to rise above USD 9,250 and USD 9,300, the bulls might take over. On the other hand, a close below USD 9,000 might spark a sharp decline.
