THE PRICE of Bitcoin dipped below $9,000 for the first time in three weeks, as it mirrored selloffs made in traditional markets amid global fears of second waves of the coronavirus.
Bitcoin price edged closer to the $10,000 levels last week, but has since taken a tumble as investors have lost confidence. The popular cryptocurrency fell to lows of $8,900 today, before regaining some ground.
The price dipped as much as 5.1 percent, recovering to roughly $9,105 as of lunch time in London.
The currency has not dipped below its 50-day moving average since April, a level considered significant by some traders.
A closely-watched phenomenon known as "halving” happened in May. This reduces the amount of the coin earned by miners.
This event also cuts in half Bitcoin's inflation rate and the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation.

When this has happened before, it has correlated with boom and bust cycles, where Bitcoin prices have ended up higher than prior to the event.
Commenting on the dip in price, Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno told Bloomberg: “I think it’s definitely part of the broader sell-off that we also saw in equities last week.
"We tapped liquidity at the $10,000 level and are now coming back down. I expect $8,500 to hold, but if not we’re looking at $7,700 and then $7,100.”
Bitcoin’s all time high still stands at nearly $20,000 a level reached in 2017.
