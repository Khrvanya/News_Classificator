This event, which is scheduled to take place in August, will cut litecoin's rate of new supply in half.
Charles Hayter, cofounder and CEO of digital currency data platform CryptoCompare , spoke to this development, stating that:
Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital , offered a similar point of view, claiming that:
Some analysts took a different tack, focusing on how well litecoin prices have performed over the last several months.
The digital currency has climbed more than 400% since December, when its price fell to less than $23, CoinMarketCap figures show.
"Litecoin has been a leader throughout this recent bullrun," said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst for social trading platform eToro .
"It is one of the most well established coins in the crypto market and has very strong fundamentals," he added.
"Litecoin has consistently been a market leader since the crypto market hit bear market lows in late 2018," said Jon Pearlstone, publisher of the newsletter CryptoPatterns .
Following litecoin's recent gains, a handful of technical analysts weighed in on what's next for the altcoin.
"Breaking the $120 price level was crucial for Litecoin since it had failed to surpass that resistance twice recently," said DiPasquale.
"Now, with LTC trading around $125, we can expect a steady rise towards $150 with some normal pullbacks along the way, provided Bitcoin remains between the $7,600 - $8,000 range at the very least," he stated.
DiPasquale was not the only one to highlight the relationship between bitcoin and its digital sibling.
Going forward, the digital currency faces "significant resistance from $130-$150," said Pearlstone.
