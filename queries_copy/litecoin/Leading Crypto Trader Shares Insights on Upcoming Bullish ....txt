While the crypto scene is abuzz with Bitcoin again plummeting to downward trend in February 2019 after a rise in the final quarter of 2018, a leading crypto trader has come up with insights on upcoming bullish events for Bitcoin, Ethereum & Litecoin. Moon Overlord, the trader behind the insights, is absolutely optimistic of the rise of BTC and other major coins in near future. One of the main reasons that is credited for the rise is increasing interest in crypto market from institutional investors. The growing adoption of Bitcoin and other crypto coins in the payment scene is another main factor here. There are scores of businesses that support crypto payments today, including tech, travel, gourmet and of course casinos.

Bitcoin can be said to be passing through its longest bearish market at present. In fact, the whole crypto scene has plummeted to 114 billion USD recently from 800 billion+ USD. Bitcoin is trading at $3,474 at present which is 82% down from its ATH period. On the other hand, Ether too has lost more than 91% of value while Litecoin is also down by 90%. But amidst all these, Moon Overlord has predicted a bullish fate for all 3 of these.
Bitcoin is known to carry a finite volume of supply that limits to 21 million BTC coins. The limited supply quotient makes BTC less inflationary compared to government-printed notes. Back in 2009, during the first launch of Bitcoin, the mining reward hovered around 50 coins. It was reduced to 25 during the first halving session.
The upcoming BTC block mine reward halving (which occurs per 210,000 blocks) has been scheduled for May 25, 2020. This halving will reduce coin reward from the present 12.5 coins to straight 6.25 coins.
