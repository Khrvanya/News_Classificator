"The chain that manages to ship some of these scalability, privacy, decentralized identity, and developer tool solutions will have a big leg up."
"The good news is that there are a number of teams now racing toward this prize," Armstrong said, adding that as a "builder," he's "rooting for them all."
Commenting on Armstrong's Twitter thead, Bloomberg editor and analyst Joe Weisenthal, said : "I'm sure he would deny it, but it's interesting to me that the CEO of the world's most prominent bitcoin-related company seems so skeptical of bitcoin."
Alongside some significant advances for the likes of litecoin, Ripple's XRP, and ethereum , bitcoin is expected to be upgraded in a so-called soft fork later this year, a development that's been called "one of the most innovative additions" that bitcoin's had .
The soft fork, which is a change to a cryptocurrency's protocol that doesn't require all nodes to be updated and is backward-compatible, is expected to improve bitcoin's privacy and scalability.
Meanwhile, as well as bitcoin's upcoming technical developments, a bitcoin-buying consumer app from bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt is due to launch in the first half of 2020 .
Armstrong made parallels between bitcoin and the early days of the internet when Netscape, a subsidiary of AOL, developed the tools that allowed the internet to grow from a niche technology to billions of users around the world.
"At Netscape, they were working with early internet protocols," Armstrong said, adding A16z co-founder Ben Horowitz had made the comparison at a recent event.
"Things weren't very scalable (dial up modems), you had to be somewhat technical to figure out how to get online, and early websites were pretty basic (static sites, looked like toys). Sound familiar to crypto at all," Armstrong asked.
The bitcoin price has climbed over the last 12-months but some smaller bitcoin rivals have made ... [+] triple-digit percentage gains.
