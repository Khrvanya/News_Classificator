Litecoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin, is noting a recent severe crash in its hash, almost reaching the 2017 levels.
This decline comes just months following the 2019 Litecoin halving event. It raises the question among the community if Litecoin’s network can be jeopardized more easily if the hash rate continues to drop.
Litecoin’s hash rate is declining violently over the past six months. The all-time high was reached during the recent July 2019, approximately 523 TH/s. Ever since then, it has been decreasing continuously, and a few days ago, it noted its lowest value for 2019 at 149 TH/s. These numbers represent a total plunge of over 70% in just four months.
The hash rate is an essential part of the cryptocurrency mechanism. It shows the amount of hash calculated each second over the network. It’s safe to assume that when more miners are mining Litecoin, it would mean more calculations performed per second, resulting in an increasing hash rate. Generally, if it’s declining, it means that fewer people are interested in mining that cryptocurrency, which usually happens if there’s less profitability.
The hash rate is also strongly correlated to the safety and security of the network. When it’s lower, this usually means that it could be more vulnerable to a 51-percent attack .
