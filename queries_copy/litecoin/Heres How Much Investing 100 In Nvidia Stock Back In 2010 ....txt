Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY ) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there’s no question some big-name stocks did much better than others along the way.
One of the top performers of the decade was semiconductor stock NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ).
Nvidia produces graphics and video processors for gaming PCs, workstations, gaming consoles, servers and other applications. The rise of data centers, online and mobile gaming and even cryptocurrency mining created a boom in demand for Nvidia’s high-end chips throughout the 2010s.
Incredibly, Nvidia shares started the 2010s trading at around $18.50 and stumbled out of the gate. The stock hit its low point of the decade at $7.97 in late 2010. In fact, Nvidia was still trading below $20 as late as mid-2015 before the stock caught fire and exploded higher to close out the decade. By late 2016, Nvidia had surpassed the $100 level, and it hit $200 in late 2017.
Nvidia hit its high water mark for the 2010s at $291.33 in late 2018 before cooling a bit in 2019. Regardless, the popular semi stock was without a doubt one of the best investments of the decade.
In fact, $100 worth of Nvidia stock in 2010 would be worth more than $1,420 today.
Looking ahead, analysts expect more consolidation from Nvidia in 2020. The average price target among the 34 analysts covering the stock is just $240, suggesting only 1.3% upside from current levels.
