The number of contracts traded on CME reached as high as 13,285, which represents about 5 Bitcoins each. According to Skew, the total amount of CME Bitcoin futures traded volume reached $485 million.
The most significant spike on CME occurred on 18 February, where the company noted $1.1 billion at least, on it traded Bitcoin contracts. This record with CME somewhat points out the increasing need amongst institutional investors to uphold contractual Bitcoin, as it offers more hedge.
Additionally, it somewhat reiterates the growing interest of the US-based Investors to upgrade or add to Bitcoin to their portfolio, probably with the government-proposed stimulus checks. The strength and high liquidity recently showed by Bitcoin might be a factor too.
Aside CME Bitcoin futures records, the cryptocurrency made a big move on 24 April to $7,500 at least. Per the report, this single movement spurred the most significant volume increment since mid-February this year.
Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event could be another reason behind the increasing volume of BTC futures on CME. In less than one month, the rewards for Bitcoin’s mining will be reduced to 6.25 Bitcoins from the current number, 12.5 Bitcoin. This is expected to heighten the liquidity of Bitcoin market.
