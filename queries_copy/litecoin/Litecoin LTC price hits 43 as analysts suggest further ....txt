On a similar note, William Bond has also put forward a bullish scenario. The analyst has marked $43.72 as the ideal buying price, expecting the price to continue on its trajectory. If this plays out, he recommends taking a profit at $51.96. On the chance that the Litecoinâ€™s advance is halted, the trader suggests putting a stop loss at $39.89.
Alex Clay, however, is less confident in a continued rally . Instead, he suggests the LTC price is in a descending channel and is close to the resistance trendline. If there is a confirmed rejection from this position he advises taking a short position. The trader has set price targets of $43.42, $42.60, and $41.77 with a potential drop back to $40.96.
