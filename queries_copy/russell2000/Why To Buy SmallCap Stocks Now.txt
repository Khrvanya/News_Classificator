The case for small-caps was classically made by Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and fellow scholar Kenneth French in 1992, when they both were professors at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Their study concluded that, because small stocks had more room to grow, they outstripped others over time. Later updates backed up that finding.

Certainly, numerous small-caps will fail in this recession, tumbling into bankruptcy court or even oblivion. Nonetheless, those that come out the other side will have demonstrated their mettle and investors will reward them.
Others, admittedly just a precious few, will go on to become the next Microsofts
. And their stocks now are on sale.
