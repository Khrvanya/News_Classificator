Stock futures were up ahead of Trump address on coronavirus.
(CNN) — US stock futures plummeted Wednesday evening after President Donald Trump announced that travel from Europe to the United States will be suspended for 30 days, beginning Friday at midnight.
Dow futures plunged more than 1,100 points, or 4.73%. S&P 500 futures fell 4.6% and Nasdaq futures were down 5%.
The suspension does not include the United Kingdom. Trump made the announcement during an address to the nation about the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has surpassed 115,000 cases worldwide. More than 4,000 people have died.
He later clarified on Twitter that "trade will in no way be affected" by the travel restriction.
