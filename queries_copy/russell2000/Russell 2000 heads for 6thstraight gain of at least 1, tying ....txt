rocketed 5.0% in afternoon trading Wednesday, which puts it on track to tie the record for the longest streak of gains of at least 1%. The index of small capitalization stocks has now retraced 52% of the selloff from the 16-month high close of 1,705.21 on Jan. 16 to the four-year closing low of 991.61 on March 18. The Russell 2000 has headed for the sixth-straight gain, with each of those gains of at last 1.0%. The only time the Russell 2000, which originated in 1979, had a similar streak of 1% gains was the six-day stretch ending Jan. 21, 2000, with help from data provided by Piper Sandler technical market strategist Craig Johnson. That streak ended about two months before index peaked as the internet bubble burst. The Russell 2000 has gained 15.1% during its current streak, and has now run up 37.5% since the March low. In comparison, the S&P 500 SPX,
rose 2.5% on Wednesday , has gained 31.2% since the March 23 closing low of 2,237.40.
