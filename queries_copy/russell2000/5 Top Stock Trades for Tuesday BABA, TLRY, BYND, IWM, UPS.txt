Bulls continued their momentum from the prior week, again pushing equities higher. With that in mind, here’s a look at a few top stock trades to start the week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Alibaba (BABA)
After a rebound from the lows, Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) stock has been stagnating over the past two weeks. However, I like the setup, because it has a well-defined risk-reward.
This type of setup is known as a bull flag (purple lines), where traders are looking for an upside move after some consolidation. Should BABA break higher out of this consolidation, we’ll need to see it take out the April highs near $215 to continue meaningfully higher.
On the downside, it’s even simpler: we need to see Alibaba hold $200. That level has not only been significant over the past several quarters, but it’s also the 50% retracement of the 2020 range. It’s also where the 50-day and 20-day moving averages comes into play.
Below this level could trigger a move down to the 200-day moving average.
