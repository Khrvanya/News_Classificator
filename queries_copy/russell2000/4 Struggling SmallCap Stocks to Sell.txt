One of the easier-to-spot market themes right now is the widening performance gap between large and small companies. While many behemoths are rapidly reclaiming lost ground, there are a growing number of little guys that remain, well, lost. Today we’re looking at four such stragglers that are top stocks to sell.
To see this trend, you can compare two of the Street’s favorite Indexes: The Russell 2000 and Nasdaq-100. The former will be your proxy for small-caps, and the latter will represent large-caps. While you could use the S&P 500, the biggest gainers are coming from the technology sector, which makes the Nasdaq-100 a more appropriate ticker. Its strength provides a more stark contrast to the Russell’s depressing drift.
The story for why small-caps find themselves losing ground in the recovery game is simple. They are the most vulnerable to an economic downturn due to their higher debt loads, dwindling cash balances, and lower credit ratings. These are all fundamental factors that cause investors to look more warily on small companies during challenging climates. And given the Covid-19 horror show that is wreaking havoc on Main Street, now seems like a perfect time for investors to shun higher-risk companies.
My list of stocks to sell contains numerous tickers, but here are four of the top picks:
iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF (NYSEARCA: IWM )
