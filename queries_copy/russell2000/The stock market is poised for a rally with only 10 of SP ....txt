1) The rally is broadening, and with energy the most beaten up sector, a rally makes some sense.
3) Cessation of tax-loss selling. "Last week was end of year for many mutual funds so last chance to punt the losers to the worst sector in the S&P: Energy," Roberto Friedlander, head of equity trading at Seaport Global, wrote to me.
4) Some have also noted that energy — along with health care — rallies and fades based on presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's prospects. She has been resolutely anti-fracking.
Two other laggard sectors may also be on the verge of breaking out: Transports and the small-cap Russell 2000 are both just shy of new highs.
A breakout in transports would be a Dow Theory confirmation: It is considered bullish when a new high in the Dow Industrials is confirmed by a new high in the transports.
For Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, the potential breakout in the Russell 2000 is a sign the old momentum leadership is out of favor — Starbucks, Nike, Disney and McDonald's. "There is a new crop of leadership in value [stocks], represented by banks, energy and small caps," he said.
While progress on trade and the Federal Reserve are drivers of the rally, Young insists that better economic reports in Europe and China and the U.S. are drivers of the recent rally.
"Lack of earnings visibility due to slow global growth has been a problem, but the numbers have been coming in better than expected. The bar is so low the numbers are beating consensus," and that is positive for markets, he said.
"I'm not sure the fundamentals warrant a breakout," O'Rourke said. He agrees job growth is steady with low inflation, GDP prospects are only 2% or so for 2020, and earnings growth is still modest for such high valuations: "Nineteen times forward earnings [for the S&P 500] is very expensive late in the cycle," he said.
