The direction of the August Comex gold futures contract is likely to be determined by trader reaction to $1728.70.
Gold futures are testing their lowest level in two weeks on Wednesday as hopes of a quick economic recovery drove investors towards higher-yielding assets, while U.S.-China tensions over Hong Kong may be helping to limit losses.
Optimism about the development of coronavirus vaccines and a revival of business activity is lifting risk sentiment in the financial markets. Traders are also responding to Tuesday’s economic data that showed U.S. consumer confidence nudged up in May and new home sales beat expectations.
At 12:41 GMT, August Comex gold is trading $1708.20, down $20.00 or -1.16%.
On the pessimistic side, growing political unrest in Hong Kong over Beijing’s proposed national security laws has kept investors on the edge. President Trump also said Washington was working on a strong response to China, adding it would be announced before the end of the week.
Some traders are saying the market could be in for a steep fall if the psychological support at $1700 fails to hold.
