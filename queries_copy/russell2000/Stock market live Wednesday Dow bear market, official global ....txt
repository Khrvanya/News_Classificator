Goldman's prediction for another 15% drop from here ending the bull market is making waves on Wednesday. The report contains some great analysis of bear markets that occur largely as the result of one singular event, as is the case now with the coronavirus. This history makes Goldman believe that while things will get much worse from here, there will be a rapid rebound higher before year-end, as seen in past "event-driven" bear markets. "Using on our top-down 2021EPS estimate, the implied year-end 2020 level of the S&P 500 index would equal 3200, roughly 30% above the mid-year low (prediction)," Goldman's equity strategists write. "This 6-month rally from the trough would be modestly higher than the historical median return following previous 'event-driven' bear markets (+21%)." -Melloy
