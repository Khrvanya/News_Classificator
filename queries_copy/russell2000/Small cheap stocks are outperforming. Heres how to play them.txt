Small- and mid-cap stocks have taken off in recent weeks, and Jefferies said in a new note that there are several stocks that will lead the next leg of the rally.
Since a June 11 pullback, the Russell 2000 has risen 5.7% while the S&P 500 has bounced back 3.8%. Smaller stocks should continue to be a smart bet in the weeks ahead, the firm said in a note to clients.
"Smaller market caps are quietly outperforming, we think this trend continues," the note said.
