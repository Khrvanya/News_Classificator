U.S. equity futures were rising again Wednesday night after the European Central Bank announced a €750 billion ($822.5 billion) bond-buying program to bolster the euro-zone economy against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
S&P 500 futures were up 2.4%, while Dow futures had risen 2.5%. A bit of optimism signaled by futures could be good news for the S&P 500, which held out above its close on Monday.
“This sets us up for a potential rising bottoms pattern,” writes Todd Market Forecast’s Stephen Todd. “It also closed above the late December 2018 closing low. The advance decline line made a new low, but it is far above the level of late December 2018. This is setting us up for a possible multi session rally.”
For Thursday, Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman thinks there could be bad news coming from the Philly Fed Index, as well as the weekly number of new jobless claims.
“We will have the Philly Fed Index coming out tomorrow, and judging by Monday’s dismal Empire State Index, industrials could get more bad news,” Berman wrote. “The weekly number of new jobless claims will also be out, and even though analysts expect only a slight uptick in the measure, some participants think that we will already start to see the negative effects of the pandemic.”
Berman also noted that small-cap stocks were under immense pressure Wednesday, with the Russell 2000 below 1000 for the first time since 2016. Such businesses could face strong headwinds in the second quarter, he writes, if Covid-19’s march through Europe is any indication.
€750 billion converts to $822.5 billion. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that it converts to $822.5 million.
