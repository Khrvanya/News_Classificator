The Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET has identified and taken down at least a part of a cryptocurrency-mining botnet dubbed VictoryGate. The previously undocumented botnet has been active for almost a year and had supposedly infected more than 35,000 computers.
The research compiled by ESET estimated that the botnet functions since May 2019. Since then, it has infected over 35,000 devices, mostly in Peru. It targets organizations in both the private and public sectors, including financial institutions. Its primary activity is mining the privacy cryptocurrency – Monero.
VictoryGate spreading happens mostly via removable devices, explained Alan Warburton, ESET researcher who investigated the botnet:
“The victim receives a USB drive that, at some point, was connected to an infected machine. It seemingly has all the filed with the same names and icons that it contained before being infected. Because of this, the content will look almost identical at first glance. However, all original files were replaced by a copy of the malware. When an unsuspecting user attempts to open one of these files, the script will open both the file that was intended and the malicious payload.”
The impact on electronic devices caused by botnets could lead to overheating and possible damages. They require a high resource usage, “resulting in a constant 90% to 99% CPU load,” Warburton added.
