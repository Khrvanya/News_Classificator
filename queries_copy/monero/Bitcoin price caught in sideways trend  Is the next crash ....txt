Bitcoin has been moving sideways for several days within a price range between $9,400 and $9,700.
Analysts continue to be bullish as Bitcoin closed above the important $9,360 mark on the monthly chart.
The Altcoin market around Ethereum follows Bitcoin and is also tending sideways.
After Bitcoin rose from $8,800 to $9,400 on May 27th, the Bitcoin price has been caught in a price range between $9,400 and $9,600. There is strong resistance along the $9,700 mark, which Bitcoin has not been able to overcome for several days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has fallen by 0.35% in the last 24 hours, to a price of $9,536.74. The market capitalization remains at just under $175 billion.
Popular trader Josh Rager describes on Twitter that Bitcoin experienced a strong month in which the price broke through several strong resistances. According to Rager, a similar development could be observed in January of this year, when a 2-month downtrend followed, which ended in March with a price crash to $3,700 .
Rager argues that Bitcoin must close above the $10,173 level on the weekly chart in order for the current trend to be bullish and continue. Bitcoin would thus draw a new local higher high.

Another anonymous trader ‚ÄúByzantine General‚Äù shared a chart with his community that shows that Bitcoin could initially fall to the $9,200 level, and then start a new uptrend towards the $10,000 mark. This is a possible scenario, but the trader emphasizes that Bitcoin must first confirm a clear trend in the next step before one can speak of a new rally or uptrend.

Bitcoin Trader ‚ÄúCold Blooded Schiller‚Äù describes that Bitcoin has not shown a monthly closing above the $ 9,360 mark in the last 12 months, until a few hours ago. Bitcoin was able to close the month‚Äôs chart with a closing price of just under $9,550. According to him and numerous other analysts, Bitcoin thus laid the foundation for a further upward trend. The trader says:
We‚Äôve not had a Monthly close above 9360 in nearly 12 months. Rejections from this level have led to tests of $6k and eventually $3k.
The Altcoin market around Ethereum currently shows a strong correlation with the price development of Bitcoin. Within the last 24 hours, Ethereum shows a plus of 0.12% to a price of $238.22. XRP shows a price increase of 0.96 % to a price of $0.20. Tether (USDT) continues to rank third among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capital.
A new report from the Federal Reserve of Kansas City describes that Bitcoin has never met the factors that make the digital asset a ‚Äústable anchor‚Äù, like gold, in the last 10 years. According to the report, Bitcoin behaves like a risky asset and less like a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù:
Overall, our results suggest that the 10-year Treasury has generally exhibited safe-haven behavior, gold has occasionally exhibited safe-haven behavior, and Bitcoin has never exhibited safe-haven behavior since its introduction. Moreover, the introduction of Bitcoin does not appear to have materially changed the safe-haven properties of government bonds or gold. Instead, Bitcoin at times appears to have behaved more like a risk asset than a safe haven.
