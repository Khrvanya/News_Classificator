In recent times, Monero has been in a smooth uptrend. In its earlier stage of an uptrend, price was making a series of higher highs and higher lows.
The symbolic uptrend deviated after encountering a $68 overhead resistance. On June 2, buyers pushed price above $68 resistance but were unable to sustain the momentum.
The upward move was resisted at $70 high. There was an immediate bearish response as the coin dropped to $64 low and moved up again. This has been the market scenario since April. Nonetheless, since April, the bulls have made several attempts without breaking it. Today, Monero is trading at $67 at the time of writing. Certainly, if the bulls break above $68 and $70 resistance levels, the crypto will rally above $80 high.
The price bars are above the 12-day EMA and the 26-day EMA. This is an indication that the crypto is likely to rise. XMR is above 74 % range of the daily stochastic indicating that XMR is in a bullish momentum. The stochastic bands are horizontal below the overbought region. The market seems to be in a sideways trend.
What Is the Next Move for Monero?
Monero is in a sideways move below the $68 overhead resistance. The bulls are yet to resolve or break this knotty price level. The uptrend will resume as soon as $68 resistance is breached. However, a strong bounce above $67 support will propel price above the resistance levels and the momentum is sustained.
