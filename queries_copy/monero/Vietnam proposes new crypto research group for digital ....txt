Although Vietnamese were more open to using cryptocurrencies, the government appears to be more concerned about the possible risks with cryptos and made several efforts to better protect users in the country. As of August 2017, the Prime Minister of Vietnam approved a project on the completion of a legal framework to regulate cryptocurrency and digital assets.
Later in April 2018, the Directive No 10/CT-TT was proposed for the effective management of transactions involving Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptos. Also, it was aimed at putting such transactions under control, in order to minimize the risks associated with them.
The crypto research group will hopefully lead to a fairly lenient regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies in the country. Already, the residents are showing huge Interest in cryptos, as to have been listed among the countries that processed 80 percent of transactions involving Bitcoin in 2017.
