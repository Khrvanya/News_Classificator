Bitcoin would need to move through to $6,900 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $6,949.17 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $6,900 levels.
Barring another broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $6,958.8 would likely limit any upside.
In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, the second major resistance level at $7,048.33 would likely come into play.
Failure to move through to $6,900 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse.
A fall through the morning low $6,826.2 would bring the first major support level at $6,760.47 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should steer of sub-$6,700 levels.
