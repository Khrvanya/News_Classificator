Bitcoin would need to move through to $8,900 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $9,110.73 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from the morning high $8,808.7.
Barring an extended crypto rebound, the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside.
In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could revisit $9,300 levels before any pullback. We would expect Bitcoin to come up short of the second major resistance level at $9,511.37, however.
Failure to move through to $8,900 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse.
A fall back through the morning low $8,620.0 would bring the first major support level at $8,498.73 into play.
Barring another extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $8,287.37.
