The near-term bearish trend, formed at late June 2019’s swing hi $13,764.0, remained firmly intact, reaffirmed by the March swing lo $4,000.
For the bulls, Bitcoin would need to break out from the 62% FIB of $10,034 to form a near-term bullish trend.

Bitcoin Cash ABC (-4.95%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-5.40%), Cardano’s ADA (-4.02%), Ethereum (-5.05%), Litecoin (-4.48%), Monero’ XMR (-4.53%), and Tezos (-4.12%) led the way down.

Elsewhere, it was a bullish start to the day.
Cardano’s ADA led the way, rising by 4.17%.
Bitcoin would need to move through $9,520 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $9,637.1 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from $9,500 levels.
Barring another broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside.
In the event of another extended crypto rally, the second major resistance level at $9,823.1 could come into play.
Failure to move through to $9,520 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse.
A fall back through the morning low $9,421.8 would bring the first major support level at $9,335.2 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer well clear of sub-$9,300 levels on the day.
