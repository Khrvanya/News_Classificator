Craig Wright Apparently Just Admitted to Hacking Mt. Gox
Craig Wright's legal team appears to alleged that he controls one of the Bitcoin addresses affiliated with an old Mt. Gox hack.
One of the faces of the anonymous Monero coin, Ricardo Spagni, also known as Fluffy Pony, tweeted out information indicating Craig Wright's affiliation with a Mt. Gox-related Bitcoin wallet.
"Just so we're clear, Craig Wright has just openly admitted (via his lawyers) to be the guy that stole 80k BTC from Mtgox," Spagni said in a June 12 tweet , including court documents in the post.
"The screenshots below show the court documents indicating the '1Feex' address is where the stolen Mt Gox funds were sent. What do you have to say, Calvin Ayre ?"
As part of an ongoing legal battle , Wright claims to have at least part ownership of the Tulip Trust â€” a list of numerous Bitcoin wallet addresses holding an allotment of roughly 1.1 million Bitcoin that he and his business associate, Dave Kleiman, reportedly mined in Bitcoin's earliest days.
Kleiman passed away in 2013, leaving Wright unable move the funds on his own, as of recent reporting .
Spagni's claims and court document screenshots indicate one of the alleged Tulip Trust wallet addresses contains stolen funds from the 2014 Mt. Gox hack.
