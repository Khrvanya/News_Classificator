At the time of writing, BTC/USD is changing hands at $9,083, having gained 2.6% in the recent 24 hours.

While it is not clear if the company plans to use XRP on a cross-border basis to provide lending capital, this move can speed up the adoption of the asset, provided that Ripple finds the way to legal and regulatory hurdles.
Monero has been trading well in recent sessions and on Wednesday pushed over 5% higher.
