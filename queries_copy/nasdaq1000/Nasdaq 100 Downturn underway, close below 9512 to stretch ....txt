Nasdaq 100 closing below 9512 today would see a definitive beginning of a correction phase in the opinion of analysts at Credit Suisse with the next support seen at 9235.
“Key for today is seen the low of last week at 9512 as a break and close below here today would mark a bearish ‘reversal week’ to add a further negative tone with next support then seen starting at 9235 and stretching down to price and gap support at 9182/53. Beneath here is needed to see a price top established, with support then seen next at 8863/61 – the 38.2% retracement of the entire rally from March and mid-May low. Holding above 9152 today on a closing basis can avoid a ‘reversal week’.”
“Resistance is seen at 9777/83 initially, above which we see the beginning of the price gap from yesterday at 9978.”
