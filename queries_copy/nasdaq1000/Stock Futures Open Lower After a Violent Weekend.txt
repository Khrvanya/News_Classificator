U.S. stock-index futures opened lower on Sunday evening amid uncertainty about the impact of demonstrations in major U.S. cities that looked set to continue for another night.
The killing of a Minneapolis man, George Floyd, has led to mass protests and conflicts between police officers and civilians across the U.S., with violence reported in Atlanta, Brooklyn, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Oakland, among other cities. Some major retailers are temporarily closing stores to avoid looting or property damage.
Markets were initially sanguine about the protests, as investors focused on the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. But after tensions and violence ratcheted up over the weekend—and as officials struggled to deal with the unrest—U. S. equity-index futures opened with moderate losses late Sunday.
