In the FTSE 100, we can see that the April 17 high was the horizontal resistance level and that the price also turned lower from this level in later March, and then in April tried to take out this level several times without succeeding.  However, in the last two days the price did indeed manage to take out the higher, and as a result the FTSE 100 soars. The target of the pattern is the 6307 levels, and it is a level derived by adding the difference in the base of the pattern, the April low, to the horizontal resistance level, to the breakout the horizontal resistance level. As we can see below, the FTSE 100 has still not rewarded these levels, thus there is room for the FTSE 100 to rise. Traders that are already not long will probably wait for a correction, and if the price was to trade near the breakout point, and likewise the April 17 high of 5841.8, then I think traders that were left behind will try to enter. But they will not always, be bullish and if the FTSE 100 trades below the April 22 low of 5632.5, the ascending triangle pattern would have failed, and there would be a risk that the FTSE 100 could add to its losses.
