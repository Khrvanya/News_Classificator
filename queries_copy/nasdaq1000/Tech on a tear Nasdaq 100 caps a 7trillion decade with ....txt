The 2008 financial crisis hit during millennials’ formative years — creating habits and fears that have kept many away from 2019’s stock market gains.
On Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 9.49 points, or 0.3%, to 3,230.78, giving it a gain of 28.9% for the year — its best performance in six years. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 76.30 points, or 0.3%, to 28,538.44, a 22.3% rise for the year. The Nasdaq composite index — which is broader than the Nasdaq 100 — climbed 26.61 points, or 0.3%, to 8,972.60 for an increase of 35.3% on the year.
Technology stocks were up 48% for the year. Financial sector stocks, especially big banks, also posted strong gains, despite a sharp pullback in interest rates. The sector ended with a 29.2% gain in 2019, while JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup climbed more than 40%.
Tech companies needed 15 years to recover from the dot-com crash, coming full circle in 2015. Since then, they’ve doubled again. But for all the rampant appreciation, the stocks still trade below their bubble-era highs relative to earnings. Although today’s valuation of 27 times annual profits isn’t cheap, it’s a long way from the triple-digit ratios in place when the dot-com rally crumbled.
“I told myself we’ll never see those valuations again in my lifetime, and I still think that’s true,” said Doug Ramsey, Leuthold Group’s chief investment officer. “We’ve gotten closer than I would have expected, which I think is pretty remarkable only 20 years later.”
Leuthold keeps a study plotting earnings, dividends, cash flow and other measures to compare then and now, a kind of Internet-bubble calendar that shows where the market is today relative to the 1990s. (It uses the S&P 500 as its benchmark, not the Nasdaq 100.) Going by that, it’s still only January 1998 — two years before the bubble burst.
Tech stocks have been able to rally to records even as they were beset by bad news. Regulatory scrutiny is bearing down on the sector, with Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump himself stepping up criticisms of technology firms.
Plagued by scandals, tech companies saw sentiment turn against them in the late 2010s — though not in the stock market. Users became more leery of their smartphone providers and social media mainstays. Today, consumer advocates and some antitrust enforcers are calling for the breakup of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet’s Google, among others.
